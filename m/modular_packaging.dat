40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> system for logistics {{that can be}} reconfigured into internal outfitting for a lunar outpost, including desks, chairs, partitions, cabinets, and radiation shielding. Logistics include clothes, equipment, food, and other consumables needed to sustain the crew {{for the duration of}} the mission. A significant mass penalty is required for the packaging and handling of logistics for re-supply of short to long-term space missions that must be brought out of the gravity well on a launch vehicle. Once the supplies have been exhausted, the packaging material is typically of no further use and is discarded. If a scheme can be developed that reuses the logistics packaging, the mass penalty can be reduced. In this research, a <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> system has been devised as a kit-of-parts that can be used for both handling logistics supplies, and then reconfigured into desks, chairs, partitions, cabinets, and radiation shielding. The system is derived from a standard International Space Station (ISS) -type Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB), using soft, unfoldable box-like containers with stiff metal inserts. The empty hydrogen-impregnated CTBs can be used as-is for cabinets, opened up for use as partitions, or draped over the habitat as layers of radiation shielding. Stiff metal inserts can be reconfigured into desks and other useful outfitting...|$|E

40|$|Miniature {{microphones}} have numerous applications {{but often}} exhibit poor performance {{which can be}} attributed to the challenges associated with capacitive detection at small size scales. Optical detection methods are able to overcome some of these challenges although miniaturized integration of these optical systems has not yet been demonstrated. An optical interferometric detection scheme is presented and is implemented using micro-scale optoelectronic devices which are used primarily in fiber optic data transmission. Using basic diffraction theory, a model is developed and used to optimize the micro-optical system within a 1 mm 3 volume. Both omnidirectional and directional optical microphone designs are presented and a <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> architecture is assembled in order to test these devices. Results from the 2 mm diameter omnidirectional optical microphone structure demonstrate a 26 dBA noise floor. The biomimetic directional optical microphone, which has an equivalent port spacing of 1 mm, demonstrates a noise floor of 34 dBA. Additionally, these results demonstrate an array of two biomimetic directional optical microphones located on the same silicon chip and separated by less than 5 mm. These results confirm the micro-optical detection method as an alternative to capacitive detection especially for miniaturized microphone applications and suggest that this method in its <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> architecture is competitive with industry leading measurement microphones.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} building composable and extensible ver-ification procedures within the Coq proof assistant. Unlike tradi-tional methods that rely on run-time generation and checking of proofs, we use verified-correct procedures with Coq soundness proofs. Though they are internalized in Coq’s logic, our provers support sound extension by users with hints over new domains, en-abling automated reasoning about user-defined abstract predicates. We maintain soundness by developing an architecture for <b>modular</b> <b>packaging,</b> construction, and composition of hint databases, which had previously only been implemented in Coq {{at the level of}} its dy-namically typed, proof-generating tactic language. Our provers also include rich handling of unification variables, enabling integration with other tactic-based deduction steps within Coq. We have imple-mented our techniques in MirrorShard, an open-source framework for reflective verification. We demonstrate its applicability by in-stantiating it to separation logic in order to reason about imperative program verification. 1...|$|E
40|$|Micro-Mechatronics and System Integration is a {{multidisciplinary}} field, which offers low cost system solutions {{based on the}} principle of homogenizing system components and consequent elimination of at least one material component or packaging level from the system. These system approaches show, compared to the existing solutions, a higher functionality, more intelligence and better reliability performance. The number of interconnects necessary to link a motor, or sensor, or an actuator to the digital bus decreases, as the smartness of the devices increases. The paper presents system solutions and manufacturing technology for mechatronic systems, developed at Fraunhofer IZM. To reduce package volume, advanced packaging technologies as Flip Chip and CSP are used, for increased reliability and additional mechanical functionality encapsulation processes as transfer-molding, a combination of transfer- and injection-molding or <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> toolkit based on LTCC are selected. The first system is a multi-chip-module for motor control used for automotive applications as window-lifts or sun-roofs. For the module at least three interconnection layers were eliminated using novel concepts as intelligent leadframes and integrated plugs. The package resists harsh environment as present in automotive applications. Another mechatronic package called TB-BGA or StackPac respectively, is a 3 -D solution, containing a pressure sensor and the complete electronics necessary for control and data transfers. This package involves CSP-technologies on flex, with an increase of functionality per volume unit by direct CSP-to-CSP mounting, eliminating substrate layers and large signal distances of unamplified signals from sensor output. The mechatronic packages will be discussed in detail. Especially cost, reliability performance and according "Design for Reliability" show the potential of micro-mechatronic solutions in automotive and industrial applications...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new concept}} of finite strip {{elements}} is introduced. Lagrangian, Hermitian and spline-type interpolations have been used independently along the two axes of the plate mid-plane. Different plate-bending theories; Mindlin, Reissner and Kirchhoff theories have been applied in the derivations of the new finitestrip elements, for isotropic and composite materials. The new elements have also been extended to work as faceted shell elements {{for the analysis of}} cylindrical shells, folded plates and stiffened plates. An efficient <b>modular</b> programming <b>package</b> based on those elements was designed, and it is capable of performing linear and non-linear stress analysis, buckling analysis and natural frequency analysis. The <b>modular</b> <b>package,</b> which was coded in FORTRAN has different solvers and a built-in mesh generator for different types of plate structures. A number of case studies have been employed for the validation of the package and testing its different capabilities. The package has proved to be an efficient tool for numerical modelling of plates, cylindrical shells, folded plates and stiffened plates made of isotropic and composite layered materials.

40|$|Vaccines {{have contributed}} {{significantly}} to the prevention of diseases. Yet millions of children, especially in low and middle income countries, remain unvaccinated and are exposed to preventable diseases such as typhoid, measles and tuberculosis. There are many reasons for this including personal belief systems, vaccine safety concerns, problems with vaccine availability, failures in the healthcare system, social barriers and economic constraints. International organizations are making continual efforts to increase vaccine coverage in these countries using various strategies. In this research we focus on the problems associated with poor design and operation of vaccine delivery systems and address these issues via four broad contributions. First, we present four quantitative models {{that can be used to}} optimize the selection of locations for vaccine outreach (where teams from clinics go to relatively remote places to administer vaccines), in order to maximize the number of residents that can be reached; each model addresses a different type of coverage possibility. The models are analyzed and contrasted using an example and adapted to address the situation when the coverage assumptions and demands are uncertain. Second, we propose modular vaccine packaging as an alternative to current packaging, which is not standardized and leads to inefficiencies when packing vaccines into a storage device; this in turn can result in vaccine shortages. We illustrate the benefits of <b>modular</b> <b>packaging</b> over current packaging schemes and storage devices that are commonly used in the field. Third, we suggest alternative ordering policies at the clinic level that are based on secondary vaccine packaging. The policies draw upon lean concepts that have been used in the manufacturing sector to simplify and improve inventory management. Since the ordering units are larger, storage space issues may occur at clinics or during vaccine transportation and the new ordering polices are analyzed in terms of their effect on storage. Lastly, we propose a mathematical model to redesign the vaccine distribution network from a central warehouse to individual health clinics and study algorithms to solve this difficult problem. We propose a hybrid algorithm based on mixed integer programming and an evolutionary strategy. We also describe how to improve the performance of the evolutionary strategy and how to use the results of the evolutionary strategy to reduce the calculation time of the integer programming model...|$|E
