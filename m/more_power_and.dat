5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though {{it is more likely that}} the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes <b>more</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure <b>more</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of Anne's reign, the Whigs gained <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> {{influence}} {{at the expense of the}} Tories. In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the general election of 1705. In that year's election for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, John Smith. George instructed his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} districts produce {{grapes of}} varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses {{to create their}} distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes {{are known for their}} high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|E
