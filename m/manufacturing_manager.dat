40|$|According to {{researchers}} and managers, {{there is a}} lack of agreement between marketing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> on critical strategic issues. However, most of the literature on the subject is anecdotal and little formal empirical research has been done. Three companies are investigated to study the extent of agreement/disagreement between <b>manufacturing</b> and marketing <b>managers</b> on strategy content and process. A novel method permits the study of agreement between the two different functional managers on the process of developing strategy. The findings consistently show that <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> operate under a wider range of strategic priorities than marketing <b>managers,</b> and that <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> participate less than marketing managers in the strategy development process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} whether <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> had the skills needed to lead union members whose unions have less {{influence}} than in the past. Leaders of manufacturing firms can strengthen the relationship between <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> and union members through positive and effective leadership. Providing union members with leadership can improve cooperation, reduce problem-solving time, and increase productivity through efficiency. The conceptual framework for this study was transformational leadership theory. Data collection involved conducting 20 semi structured interviews with participants affiliated with the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the Toledo, Ohio, area. The participants (9 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers,</b> 9 UAW members, and 2 management consultants) shared their views of how <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> apply leadership to affect individuals and organizations. Moustakas 2 ̆ 7 s 5 -step process was used to identify themes and patterns. Analysis of the data revealed that younger managers are not providing leadership to union members and that the size of the facility directly affects the ability of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> to apply leadership skills. These findings indicate that organizational leaders do not define leadership expectations well and that young managers may lack leader legitimacy. With insights from the study, manufacturing and union leaders may be able to improve managers 2 ̆ 7 leadership of union employees, resulting, potentially, in a less adversarial work environment as well as an improved societal view of labor unions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> have a {{measurable}} mindset (or frame) that structures {{their response to}} the manufacturing environment. Most importantly, this frame represents a set of assumptions about the relative prominence of concepts in the manufacturing domains, {{about the nature of}} people, and about the sensemaking processes required {{to understand the nature of}} the manufacturing environment as seen through the eyes of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers.</b> This paper uses work in the area of text analysis and extends the scope of a methodology that has been approached from two different directions by Carley (Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18 (51), 533 - 558, 1997) and Gephart (Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18 (51), 583 - 622, 1997).

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{reasoned}} action {{is used to}} explain why <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> champion the adoption of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). Championing includes familiarization behaviours, such as experimenting with new technologies, and promotion behaviours, such as convincing others {{of the benefits of}} new technologies. The theory of reasoned action suggests that championing behaviours of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> are determined by their personal beliefs about the outcomes of the adoption of AMT and their beliefs about the attitudes of superiors, peers and subordinates towards AMT. The explanatory power of the theory of reasoned action is tested with data collected from a survey of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>managers</b> in the automotive parts industry. A partial least squares analysis of the data shows that the theory does explain the championing behaviours of familiarization and promotion. The paper concludes that personal beliefs about the outcomes of adoption of AMT are most significant in determining promotion behaviours and that beliefs about the attitudes of senior executives towards AMT automation are most significant in motivating familiarization behaviours. empirical flexible manufacturing management of technology implementation...|$|R

40|$|Stereotypically, {{marketing}} is mainly concerned about satisfying customers and manufacturing is mainly interested in factory efficiency. Using the principal-agent (agency) paradigm, which {{assumes that the}} marketing and manufacturing managers of the firm will act in their self-interest, we seek incentive plans that will induce those managers to act so that {{the owner of the}} firm can attain as much as possible of the residual returns. One optimal incentive plan can be interpreted as follows: The owner subcontracts to pay the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>manager</b> a fixed rate for all capacity he delivers. Each marketing manager receives all of the returns from his product. In turn, all managers pay a fixed fee to the owner. Under this plan, the marketing managers will often complain about the stock level decisions, even though these levels are announced in advance. Under a revised plan, the owner can eliminate such complaints by delegating the stocking decisions to the respective marketing managers, without any loss. This plan is interpreted as requiring the owner to make a futures market for manufacturing capacity, paying the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>manager</b> the expected marginal value for each unit of capacity delivered, receiving the realized marginal value from the marketing managers, and losing money on average in the process. manufacturing/marketing incentives, agency theory, hidden effort, newsvendor model, delegation, futures market, franchising...|$|E
