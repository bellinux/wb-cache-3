The review analysis shows a number {{of positive and negative}} outcomes of the new funding structure. In general, however, the review indicates that the centres gravitate towards consultancy, stimulated by the criteria set by the EPSRC. Consequently, setting the industrial agenda to improve the competitive position of the U. K. manufacturing industry hardly occurs. Furthermore, centres with a stronger strategy and research staff did outperform those others in attracting additional funding. A focus on specific sectors correlates with a negative impact on research output.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{problems}} associated with the planning and control of production, with particular reference to a small aluminium die casting company. The main problem areas were identified as: (a) A {{need to be able to}} forecast the customers demands upon the company's facilities. (b) A need to produce a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>programme</b> in which the output of the foundry (or die casting section) was balanced with the available capacity in the machine shop. (c) The need to ensure that the resultant system enabled the company's operating budget to have a reasonable chance of being achieved. At the commencement of the research work the major customers were members of the automobile industry and had their own system of forecasting, from which they issued manufacturing schedules to their component suppliers, The errors in the forecast were analysed and the distributions noted. Using these distributions the customer's forecast was capable of being modified to enable his final demand to be met with a known degree of confidence. Before a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>programme</b> could be developed the actual manufacturing system had to be reviewed and it was found that as with many small companies there was a remarkable lack of formal control and written data. Relevant data with regards to the component and the manufacturing process had therefore to be collected and analysed. The foundry process was fixed but the secondary machining operations were analysed by a technique similar to Component Flow Analysis and as a result the machines were arranged in a series of flow lines. A system of manual production control was proposed and for comparison, a local computer bureau was approached and a system proposed incorporating the production of additional management information. These systems are compared and the relative merits discussed and a proposal made for implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{clothing}} industry globally has undergone rapid change {{within the past}} few decades. The production of fashion {{has evolved into a}} multi faceted industry that is not only concerned with the manufacture of clothing but also the systems of production, distribution, diffusion, reception, adoption and consumption which drive the fashion industry. Within the last 10 years there has been a notable drop in applications for this programme even though there is a high employability rate with demand exceeding supply. A number of reasons for this trend have been identified. The South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu) estimates 13400 jobs were lost in the sector in the first 11 months of 2009. Sactwu researcher Etienne Vlok says that in the mid- 2000 s, the industry was losing about 20000 jobs a year, but {{in the past three years}} this has dropped to between 12000 to 14000 jobs a year (Mathews, 2010). This trend is also evident in both the United States of America as well as the United Kingdom as Higher Education Institutions experienced difficulties in recruiting students for textile and clothing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>programmes</b> due to a negative public perception of the industry. This has brought with it the need to revise the Clothing Management programme in order to keep abreast with the changes in the industry and to align the programme to meet the regional demand for graduates.

40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} find themselves, {{whether they}} like it or not, in a more global and changing reality. Fiercer competition, dynamic markets, new consumer habits, stronger environmental regulations, and new technological possibilities, are forcing manufacturing companies to change. The practical effects for European manufacturers are 1) new and innovative products, 2) global value chains, 3) automation, and, 4) a shift from products to solutions. This research is addressing the changes needed for operations in a single enterprise (a group of departments, a plant, {{or a group of}} closely located plants), {{to take advantage of the}} competitive situation. For such “internal” operations, the new challenges require changes both in technology and practices. The main concern of this research is the practices, and how a reengineering of manufacturing and office operations can improve performance. The choice of scope is based on the assumption that operations activities are a major source for competitiveness. To reengineer operations activities in processes rather than functions, and to implement best practices wherever appropriate, can therefore provide dramatic competitive improvements. The overall objective of this research is to: • establish enterprise reengineering as an approach that enables manufacturing enterprises to achieve fit between market requirements and operations capabilities. Enterprise reengineering is viewed as model-based and strategy driven approach that enables manufacturers to realise the “soft” or infrastructural aspects of an operations strategy. To support such reengineering efforts, enterprises are viewed not only from a process perspective but also from a resource, materials, information, organisations, and control perspective. Modelling and analysing enterprises from these perspectives can support their effort to implement best practices, and ensure that the practices are combined in a way that supports the overall business strategy. The overall objective is divided into more specific objectives: • To develop a strategic framework for enterprise reengineering • To develop a consistent and practical enterprise reengineering methodology to support the formulation and realisation of operations strategies • To develop architecture for conceptual enterprise modelling that ensures a coherent, decomposed, and holistic picture of enterprise operations • To establish “flow manufacturing” as a (optional) best practice programme for enterprise reengineering Together, the strategic framework, the methodology, and the modelling architecture should enable enterprises to achieve their performance objectives through an enterprise reengineering effort. In cases where an enterprise mapping and analysis concludes that improvements in manufacturing planning and control, order management, layout and flow, or inventory, should be performed, the flow <b>manufacturing</b> <b>programme</b> should provide practical guidance and a set of principles to support reengineering. In order to achieve these objectives, the following issues are reviewed in this thesis: 1) operations strategy, 2) enterprise reengineering, 3) flow manufacturing, 4) enterprise modelling, and, 5) change management. Based on these literature studies, a strategic framework, a methodology, a modelling architecture for enterprise reengineering and a flow <b>manufacturing</b> <b>programme</b> are proposed. The major outcome of this research is an enterprise reengineering methodology, which includes strategic planning, and operations mapping, analysis, design, and implementation. The methodology consists of the following models, principles, and tools: • A operations strategy checklist • Four flow manufacturing design principles • An architecture for conceptual enterprise modelling • Seven change management principles • A procedural guide for enterprise reengineering • An operations performance audit sheet • A five-step approach to flow manufacturing reengineering The research is based on a case study of HÅG Fast, a very successful enterprise reengineering project carried out in 1991 - 1992. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the methodology to analyse and understand enterprises, and the dramatic improvements in performance that can be achieved by implementing flow manufacturing practices. In addition, the enterprise reengineering methodology has been proved useful in several field studies. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The results of this R and D project are software development tools and a workshop-oriented programming language (WOP) for NC machine tools. WOP can be integrated into or applied in close relation to machine equipment; it is also suitable for office use (job preparation). Its main characteristics are the comprehensive uniform user surface and functionality of the system for machining processes in <b>manufacturing.</b> Users can <b>programme,</b> change, and technologically adjust programme parts by means of graphical symbols, text entries and simulation in a dialogue designed by themselves. This is possible since problem-oriented parts of the programme are separated throughout from the parts relating to machines and to technologies. The WOP system supports the user in all stages of programming, during the NC-centered processing of geometry data taken from a CAD system as well as when starting out from a drawing. User experiences confirm that workshop-oriented prgramming according to WOP is economical, well accepted by shopfloor staff, and results in shorter teaching phases. The system is therefore especially suitable for application in those flexible manufacturing concepts which consider lively and viable skilled work as a crucial factor in production.
