At the same time, the 46th Army's 6th Guards Rifle Corps and 34th Rifle Corps reached the eastern and southeastern outskirts of the city. The bulk of the German defenses were concentrated in the east, where it was anticipated that the main blow would come. Exploiting weak points, the 37th and 46th Armies moved into the city at dawn on 21 February; it was cleared by 16:00 that day. In celebration of the city's capture, a 224-gun artillery salute was fired in Moscow. A special 37th Army detachment prevented the German demolition of the Krivoi Rog power stations and the Saksahan dams.|$|E

25|$|But {{despite their}} success, other units' actions during the Battle of the Bulge {{received}} much greater {{attention from the}} press. This was due in part because during early December 1944, Bastogne was a rest and recreation area for many war correspondents.

But there were no correspondents in the area of Saint-Vith, Elsenborn or Monschau. The static, stubborn resistance of troops in the north, who refused to yield their ground in the cold snow and freezing rain despite the heavy German attacks, didn't get a casual observer excited. The image of supply troops trying to bring and ammunition and cold food, crawling through <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> to front-line troops dug into frozen foxholes around Montjoie, Elsenborn and Butgenbach was not exciting news.|$|E

He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously hurt. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed.

2500|$|By 1842, many emigrants favored oxencastrated bulls (males) of {{the genus}} Bos (cattle), {{generally}} over four years oldas the best animal to pull wagons, because they were docile, generally healthy, and able to continue moving in difficult conditions such as <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> Oxen could also survive on prairie grasses and sage, unlike horses, {{who had to be}} fed. Moreover, oxen were less expensive to purchase and maintain than horses. Oxen also could stand idle for long periods without suffering damage to the feet and legs. Oxen were trained by leading, the use of a whip or goad, and the use of oral commands (such as [...] "Gee" [...] (right), [...] "Haw" [...] (left), and [...] "Whoa" [...] (stop)). Two oxen were typically yoked together at the neck or head; the left ox was referred to as the [...] "near" [...] or [...] "nigh" [...] ox, and the right ox as the [...] "off" [...] ox. While no reins, bits, or halters were needed, the trainer had to be forceful. [...] Oxen typically traveled at a steady pace up to two miles an hour.|$|E

It was difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilisation when <b>mud,</b> ice <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> froze between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid.

Additional problems are because many roads and railway lines built during the Soviet period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed.

Each group was assigned a base on the Foggia plains, the 99th being stationed at Tortorella. The planes arrived at their new base in December 1943. Living conditions at Tortorella were very harsh. The summers were hot and dusty, the winters cold and wet. Buildings were few, and airplane maintenance crews worked out in the open. The men lived in tents using homemade gasoline stoves for heat.

50|$|The {{other major}} Lend-Lease {{recipient}} of the M3, the Soviet Union, was less happy with the tank, considering it under-gunned, under-armored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The M3's radial aircraft engine required high-octane fuel, which complicated Soviet logistics as most of their tanks used diesel or low-octane fuel. High fuel consumption led to a poor range characteristic, especially sensitive {{for use as a}} reconnaissance vehicle. Also, compared to Soviet tanks, the M3's narrower tracks resulted in a higher ground pressure, getting them more easily stuck in the spring <b>and</b> autumn <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> winter <b>snow</b> conditions on the Eastern Front. In 1943, the Red Army tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design was not much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.|$|R

With how sweet humility did this elemental spirit perform all needful offices for the household in which he was domesticated! He was equal to the concoction of a grand dinner, yet scorned not to roast a potato or toast a bit of cheese. How humanely did he cherish the school-boy's icy fingers, and thaw the old man's joints with a genial warmth which almost equalled the glow of youth! And how carefully did he dry the cowhide boots that had trudged through <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> and the shaggy outside garment stiff with frozen sleet! taking heed, likewise, to the comfort of the faithful dog who had followed his master through the storm. When did he refuse a coal to light a pipe, or even a part of his own substance to kindle a neighbor's fire? And then, at twilight, when laborer, or scholar, or mortal of whatever age, sex, or degree, drew a chair beside him and looked into his glowing face, how acute, how profound, how comprehensive was his sympathy with the mood of each and all! He pictured forth their very thoughts. To the youthful he showed the scenes of the adventurous life before them; to the aged the shadows of departed love and hope; and, if all earthly things had grown distasteful, he could gladden the fireside muser with golden glimpses of a better world.

6000|$|The general {{effect of}} a Utopian {{population}} is vigour.

The dress is varied and graceful; that of the women reminds one most of the Italian fifteenth century; they have an abundance of soft and beautifully-coloured stuffs, and the clothes, even of the poorest, fit admirably. Their hair is very simply but very carefully and beautifully dressed, and except in very sunny weather they do not wear hats or bonnets. There is little difference in deportment between one class and another; they all are graceful and bear themselves with quiet dignity, and among a group of them a European woman of fashion in her lace and feathers, her hat and metal ornaments, her mixed accumulations of [...] "trimmings," [...] would look like a barbarian tricked out with the miscellaneous plunder of a museum. Boys and girls wear much the same sort of costume--brown leather shoes, then a sort of combination of hose and close-fitting trousers that reaches from toe to waist, and over this a beltless jacket fitting very well, or a belted tunic. Many slender women wear the same sort of costume. We should see them in it very often in such a place as Lucerne, as they returned from expeditions in the mountains. The older men would wear long robes very frequently, but the greater proportion of the men would go in variations of much the same costume as the children. There would certainly be hooded cloaks and umbrellas for rainy weather, high boots for <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> and cloaks and coats and furry robes for the winter. There would be no doubt a freer use of colour than terrestrial Europe sees in these days, but the costume of the women at least would be soberer and more practical, and (in harmony with our discussion in the previous chapter) less differentiated from the men's.|$|E
