40|$|Injection molding is {{the process}} used to produce {{products}} of desired shape and size and normally parts made in injection molding process can have their own distinctive set of possible defects like sink marks, weld lines, war page, shrinkage, shot shorts, etc. due to the complex technology involved. To minimize these defects and to obtain good quality of product, optimization of parameters must be carried. In this project Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS with grade IM 14 GM) thermoplastic was used and ANSYS 14. 5 software {{has been used to}} optimize the parameters like temperature and pressure to reduce the shot short defect which means incompletion filling of mold and to produce good quality of ABS products and in addition, fabrication was carried out with the results obtained in the analysis and then these fabricated materials was subjected for thermal testing to determine quality of the product. Generally, ABS plastics have various applications that include electrical and electronic equipment, as well as widespread applications in automobiles, communication instruments, and other commodities. Among these applications, the <b>motor</b> <b>cover</b> of the table top grinder was the ABS plastic product chosen that was produced using injection molding machine since <b>motor</b> <b>cover</b> has many applications. The injection molding machine has different zones of which the optimization was carried out. The optimized temperatures of nozzle, zone 1, zone 2, zone 3, zone 4, with which the good quality <b>motor</b> <b>cover</b> was produced is 100 °C 180 °C, 160 °C, 150 °C, 140 °C respectively and the injection pressure was optimized as 100 bar.

The trigger of the doors work is the electrodes sensor, {{which serves as a}} water level indicator. Results monitoring water doors automatically could be kept in database. From the software development has been done, If the water level in level 3 with an intake capacity of 4500 cm 3 so 2 second after the water level in level 3, the gate 1 will be open and when the water level is already showing level 5 with an intake capacity of 7500 cm 3, then 2 second after the water level in level 5 all the gates will be open. All the gates will be closed when the water levels are at level 2 or after 14 seconds all the gates open with an intake capacity of 3000 cm 3.

40|$|Recycling {{capacities}} in Germany for post-user automobiles {{are estimated}} {{as well as}} the economy of separation of large car components like bumpers, cooler grating and hub caps. Costs of disassembling, plastic separation and utilization are evaluated. Based on the recycling capacities of eight plants in Germany it is concluded, that the total capacities in Germany are sufficient for the recycling of large car components. Plastics from bumpers (PP/EPDM, PC/PBT, PC/PET, SMC, or PUR-(R) RIM), from cooler gratings (ABS, ABS/ASA, ASA, PA, PP, or SMC), and from hub caps (PA, ABS, ABS/PC, PP-T and others) may be separated via milling or granulating.
