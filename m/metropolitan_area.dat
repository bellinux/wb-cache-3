40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the effects of}} increased employment growth on a <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area’s</b> employment to population ratio varies with the initial tightness of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area’s</b> labor market. This examination is relevant to evaluating the benefits of local economic development policies in different <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas.</b> Much {{of the benefits of}} such policies are in higher employment rates. The empirical estimates suggest that the effectiveness of employment growth in increasing the employment to population ratio is lower in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> with “tight ” labor markets. In addition, some estimates suggest that growth has the greatest long-run effects on the employment to population ratio in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> with some looseness in labor market conditions, compared to <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> with the most tight or most loose labor market conditions.

40|$|The {{setting up}} of <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> {{is a process}} which is still in {{progress}} in Romania. The legislative framework {{for the creation of}} these areas has been built up only since 2001, and there are still a number of juridical inconsistencies concerning the association of administrative units to form <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas.</b> On the other hand, political reasons and the fear of losing a certain degree of authority and to become subordinates of the large cities (in the case of rural municipalities) also hindered the development of <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> in Romania.
