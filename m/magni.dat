5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be {{anything}} left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and <b>Magni</b> will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Bartali and Coppi {{intensified}} after the war. Bartali won his last Giro in 1946, with Coppi winning his second the following year. Coppi won a further three Giros and in 1952 {{he became the}} first cyclist to win the Tour de France and Giro in the same year. Swiss Hugo Koblet became the first non-Italian to win the race in 1950. No one dominated the tour during the 1950s, Coppi, Charly Gaul and Fiorenzo <b>Magni</b> each won two Giros during the decade. The 1960s were similar, five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil won in 1960, and 1964, while Franco Balmamion won two successive Giros in 1962 and 1963.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{inconsistencies}} {{arising from the}} use of NPV and CAPM for capital budgeting. It shows that (i) CAPM capital budgeting decision-making based on disequilibrium NPV is deductively inferred by the Capital Asset Pricing Model, (ii) the use of the disequilibrium NPV is widespread in finance both as a decision rule and as a valuation tool, (iii) the disequilibrium NPV does not guarantee additivity nor consistency with arbitrage pricing, so that it is unreliable for valuation, (iv) <b>Magni’s</b> (2002, 2007 a, forthcoming) criticism of the NPV criterion refers to the disequilibrium NPV, and De Reyck’s (2005) project valuation method, on the basis of which <b>Magni’s</b> criticism to NPV is objected, leaves decision makers open to arbitrage losses and incorrect decisions...|$|R
40|$|Counterfactual conditionals are {{cognitive}} {{tools that}} we incessantly use during our lives for judgments, evaluations, decisions. Counterfactuals {{are used for}} defining concepts as well; an instance of this is attested by the notions of opportunity cost and excess profit (residual income), two all-pervasive notions of economics: They are defined by undoing a given scenario and constructing a suitable counterfactual milieu. Focussing on the standard paradigm and <b>Magni’s</b> (2000, 2005, 2009 a,b) proposal this paper shows that the formal translation of the counterfactual state is not univocal and that <b>Magni’s</b> model retains formal properties of symmetry, additive coherence, homeomorphism,which correspond to properties of frame-independence, time invariance, completeness. Two introductory studies are also presented to illustrate how people cope with these counterfactuals and ascertain whether either model is seen as more “natural”. A brief {{discussion of the results}} obtained is also provided...|$|R

25|$|In the 1970s the Tour of Flanders {{needed a}} new identity. The {{asphalting}} {{of many of the}} traditional roads and hills made the race less demanding and more riders were able {{to keep up with the}} best. Eric Leman became the local hero when he won three times in four years, thereby equalling Buysse and <b>Magni's</b> record. Sprint specialist Leman outsprinted Eddy Merckx as part of a select group on each of his wins, much to the discontent of fans and organisers.|$|R
25|$|Fiorenzo <b>Magni,</b> a rare Italian in Belgian classics, won so many {{intermediate}} prizes {{during his}} long solo flight {{that they would}} have bought him a house (see above). He was one of nine to escape the field at Ingelmunster. The others cracked one by one until <b>Magni</b> was alone by Strijpen– the point where he made his winning move the previous year. He rode the last 75km alone to win the Ronde for the third successive year. <b>Magni</b> won by almost eight minutes and the first five finishers were foreigners.|$|E
25|$|The 1947 Giro d'Italia was {{the first}} Giro to have all {{competing}} riders {{be a part of}} a trade team, rather than some riders competing as independents. Fausto Coppi, Gino bartali, and Aldo Ronconi broke away during the fourth leg while climbing the Abetone and rode into Prato where Coppi won the stage and Bartali took the overall lead. Bartali held that lead until the sixteenth stage when his chain dropped on the climb of the Falzarego when Coppi saw this he attacked. On the descent of the Falzarego, the same misfortune struck Coppi, which allowed Bartali to rejoin him. Later, Coppi attacked on the Passo Pordoi and Bartali could not keep up. Coppi took the stage and the overall lead, which he held all the way to race's finish. Fiorenzo <b>Magni</b> won the 1948 Giro d'Italia by a margin of eleven seconds— the smallest margin of victory in the history of the race— over Ezio Cecchi. <b>Magni</b> gained significant time after being a part of a successful breakaway in the race's ninth day of racing. Magni's lead over race favorites Coppi and Bartali was near thirteen minutes. Cecchi briefly gained the lead of the race for two stages; however, <b>Magni</b> took the lead after the seventeenth stage which saw riders cross the Pordoi Pass. Coppi and his team suspected that <b>Magni</b> received help from the spectators, which the organizers gave <b>Magni</b> a two-minute penalty for. The penalty to <b>Magni</b> wasn't enough to prevent him from winning the race, but he did so by the slimmest of margins.|$|E

50|$|Meili {{also appears}} in the eddic poem Hárbardsljód where Thor calls himself Odin's son, Meili's brother and <b>Magni's</b> father. In Snorri's Gylfaginning Ali is only another name for Vali and Nep {{is the father of}} Baldur's wife Nanna. If this list is correct in giving Odin a son named Nep, and if that Nep is {{identical}} to the father of Nanna mentioned by Snorri, then Nanna would also be Baldur's niece. But marriage between uncle and niece, though common in many cultures, does not normally appear in old Scandinavian literature.|$|R
500|$|Corbucci hired {{established}} German actor Klaus Kinski to play Loco, {{a character}} who was partially intended to emulate Gorca, the vampire played by Boris Karloff in Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which served as a major stylistic influence on The Great Silence. Other cast members were established character actors in or outside the Spaghetti Western genre, including Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Marisa Merlini, Raf Baldassare, Carlo D'Angelo, Spartaco Conversi and Bruno Corazzari (an actor often compared to Kinski). Frank Wolff, usually known for playing serious or villanous characters, was cast against type in the semi-comical role of Sheriff Burnett. [...] Vonetta McGee, a then-unknown pre-law San Francisco State College dropout and amateur actress who had moved to Rome to find work at Cinecittà, was cast as Pauline in her first film role. After appearing in Corbucci's film and Luigi <b>Magni's</b> Faustina, McGee was invited to return to America by Sidney Poitier, where she became a major actress in the blaxploitation genre. Alex Cox later cast her as Marlene in his film Repo Man based on her performance as Pauline.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{makes use}} of <b>Magni's</b> (2013) Average Interest Rate (AIR) in order to fi nd a {{performance}} index which {{does not depend on}} the valuation rate (i. e., benchmark return). To this end, we distort the AIR by dropping the discount factors in the formula. The resulting modi ed AIR (MAIR) is the ratio of overall (undiscounted) return to overall (undiscounted) capital. While seemingly a na ive metric, we show that it is a genuinely internal metric, capable of capturing an investment's economic profi tability, {{as long as it is}} compared with an appropriate cuto rate which adequately takes account of the opportunity cost of capital. The not-so na ve MAIR is then extended to several di erent capital bases; the result is that other well-known (allegedly na ve) metrics, such as cash multiple, undiscounted pro tability, Modi ed Dietz and Simple Dietz return are given economic signi cance: each such metric is a (pseudo-na ve) performance index that correctly expresses the investment's amount of return per unit of a speci c capital: overall capital, initial investment, total cash out ow, average cash out ow).

25|$|<b>Magni</b> (2010) {{introduced}} a new approach, named AIRR approach, based on the intuitive notion of mean, that solves {{the problems of the}} IRR.

25|$|At the Uppsala Council 1531, the Swedish King Gustav Vasa {{took the}} final step of {{breaking}} with the Roman Catholic Church, by personally appointing Laurentius as the new archbishop. On September 22 that year, Laurentius was consecrated archbishop by the Petrus <b>Magni,</b> Bishop of Västerås. <b>Magni</b> {{is said to have}} been ordained bishop in Rome, although this point is disputed, and by consecrating Laurentius the apostolical succession is said to be retained in Sweden, which was considered important. But although the consecration took place according to Catholic ritual, those who officiated at the consecration made a secret declaration that they were acting under pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Performance Episode: Patrice {{opened the}} show with her {{original}} song, [...] "Beautiful Thing". The song choice prompted an echo of Dave's advice to Zayra a few weeks back: seek a solo career. <b>Magni's</b> rendition of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] met with positive review, as well as Ryan's performance of his original song, [...] "Back of Your Car". Ryan threw his guitar, which was an expensive move, but he was praised for it. Storm's performance of [...] "Cryin'" [...] was also well received, as well as Dilana's performance of [...] "Every Breath You Take", a song that she readily stripped down (at the mansion) to perform. Toby's rendition of [...] "Layla" [...] was heightened when {{he took off his}} shirt, a move that Tommy Lee said made the ladies happy. Lukas capped off the night with his performance of [...] "All These Things That I've Done", his only negative comments being centered on facing away from the audience too much. He also received an ambiguous comment from Tommy Lee. Lee said, [...] "Check please", and proceeded to throw down the microphone. This comment has been interpreted by Lukas fans as being a positive, while to others as negative (Check please, being a statement generally signaling one's desire to leave).|$|R
40|$|Capital {{budgeting}} {{decisions are}} {{of paramount importance}} in production economics and, in particular, in manufacturing: investors direct their funds towards firms that create value and withdraw funds from companies which destroy value. Unfortunately, a disparate class of metrics and criteria is available to managers and shareholders for making decisions and assess performance: Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Modified Internal Rate of Return, Profitability Index, Average Accounting Rate of Return, Project Investment Rate. These metrics are originated from different perspectives and are usually conceptualized as leading to non-equivalent evaluations and decisions. Building upon <b>Magni’s</b> (2010, 2013) AIRR approach, we show that all the above-mentioned criteria can be encompassed into a unifying framework, which stems from two intuitive concepts: the notion of Chisini mean {{and the notion of}} coherent rate of return. The former, introduced by Chisini (1929), is a general method for constructing a synthetic measure of a set of observations taking into account the rationale of the problem; the latter is the ratio of return to capital, which expresses the amount of return per unit of invested capital. By mingling the two concepts, we show that the traditional metrics provide reciprocally consistent pieces of information. We also unearth a surprising network of relations and present new metrics which correctly capture a project's economic profitability...|$|R
500|$|In 1968, Cardinale {{featured}} opposite Franco Nero in The Day of the Owl, in a David di Donatello for Best Actress-winning performance. She {{reunited with}} Rock Hudson in the Italian-made criminal comedy A Fine Pair under director Francesco Maselli. She also appeared alongside Rod Taylor in The Hell with Heroes {{and starred in}} one of her best-known roles as former prostitute Jill McBain in Sergio Leone's epic Western Once Upon a Time in the West. Such was the power of her performance as the whore that Leone's biographer Robert C. Cumbow described her as [...] "permanently engraved in cinematic history" [...] and noted how suited to the role she was: [...] "Her sex-goddess appearance combines with her more mystical iconographic associations to ease the progress of Jill from tart to town builder, from harlot to earth mother, from sinner to symbol of America—the apotheosis of the harlot with a heart of gold". In 1969, Cardinale starred opposite Nino Manfredi in Luigi <b>Magni's</b> Nell'anno del Signore, based on the actual story of the capital execution of two carbonari in papal Rome. This was followed by a role as a telephone operator in Certo certissimo ... anzi probabile, and as a nurse opposite Sean Connery and Peter Finch in Mikhail Kalatozov's The Red Tent, based on the story of the mission to rescue Umberto Nobile and the other survivors of the crash of the Airship Italia.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{three years}} after his first Giro d'Italia victory, Fiorenzo <b>Magni</b> won the Giro d'Italia again. Magni's major rival in the 1951 edition was the Belgian Rik Van Steenbergen who {{performed}} {{very well in the}} Dolomites. <b>Magni</b> took the lead after descending successfully down the final climb of the eighteenth stage and then protecting the lead all way to the race's finish. The 1952 Giro d'Italia featured one of the first deaths by a rider in the Giro in Orfeo Ponsin who died from complications after crashing into a tree on the descent of the Merluzza. Fausto Coppi took the race lead upon the tenth stage's finish, but the following day he attacked on the Passo Pordoi and rode the rest of the stage by himself to increase his lead. Coppi won two stages after gaining the overall lead, which further cemented his lead in the race.|$|E
