Helped by John Anderson, the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047", a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3.84×108km (2.58 AU) based on the parallax value of 0.018". However, limb darkening and <b>measurement</b> <b>errors</b> resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements.|$|E

For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small <b>measurement</b> <b>errors</b> of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

When estimating the labor supply response to these predictable wage changes, I account for serially correlated <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and for <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> that is correlated with true hours and wages.

40|$|The {{approximate}} {{effects of}} <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> {{on a variety}} of measures of inequality and poverty are derived. They are shown to depend on the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> variance and functionals of the error contaminated income distribution, but not on the form of the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> distribution, and to be accurate within a rich class of error free income distributions and <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> distributions. The functionals of the error contaminated income distribution that approximate the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> induced distortions can be estimated. So it is possible to investigate the sensitivity of welfare measures to alternative amounts of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and, when an estimate of the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> variance is available, to calculate corrected welfare measures.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> in {{observed}} data can lead researchers to draw incorrect inferences (Fuller 1987;Carroll et al. 1994;Bound et al. 2001;Hyslop and Imbens 2001). Much of the early work in this area focused on the typical textbook model of classical <b>measurement</b> <b>error.</b> However in their study of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> in labour market data, Bound et al. (1994) suggested that the assumption of classical <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> was often a matter of convenience rather than conviction. Bound et al. (2001), pg. 3709 conclude their survey of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> by calling for researchers to pay greater attention to the possibility of non-classical <b>measurement</b> <b>error,</b> both in assessing the likely biases in the analyses that take no account of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and in devising procedures that correct for such error.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 2000s, a second {{generation}} of planet-hunting spectrographs permitted far more precise measurements. The HARPS spectrograph, installed at the La Silla Observatory in Chile in 2003, can identify radial-velocity shifts as small as 0.3m/s, enough to locate many rocky, Earth-like planets. A third generation of spectrographs is expected to come online in 2017.

40|$|Zero {{correlation}} between <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and model error has been assumed in existing panel data models dealing specifically with <b>measurement</b> <b>error.</b> We extend this literature and propose a simple model where one regressor is mismeasured, allowing the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> to correlate with model error. Zero {{correlation between}} <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and model error {{is a special}} case in our model where correlated <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> equals zero. We ask two research questions. First, we wonder if the correlated <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> can be identified {{in the context of}} panel data. Second, we wonder if classical instrumental variables in panel data need to be adjusted when correlation between <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> and model error cannot be ignored. Under some regularity conditions the answer is yes to both questions. We then propose a two-step estimation corresponding to the two questions.

25|$|This {{highlights}} {{a common}} error: this example is {{an abuse of}} OLS which inherently requires that the errors in the independent variable (in this case height) are zero or at least negligible. The initial rounding to nearest inch plus any actual <b>measurement</b> <b>errors</b> constitute a finite and non-negligible error. As a result, the fitted parameters are not the best estimates they are presumed to be. Though not totally spurious the error in the estimation will depend upon relative size of the x and y errors.|$|E
25|$|This {{can either}} be an {{advantage}} or a drawback: if extreme values are real (not <b>measurement</b> <b>errors),</b> and of real consequence, as in applications of extreme value theory such as building dikes or financial loss, then outliers (as reflected in sample extrema) are important. On the other hand, if outliers {{have little or no}} impact on actual outcomes, then using non-robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics, and robust alternatives should be used, such as other quantiles: the 10th and 90th percentiles (first and last decile) are more robust alternatives.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{distribution}} is useful {{because of the}} central limit theorem. In its most general form, under some conditions (which include finite variance), it states that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, become normally distributed {{when the number of}} observations is sufficiently large. Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes (such as <b>measurement</b> <b>errors)</b> often have distributions that are nearly normal. Moreover, many results and methods (such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting) can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{developments}} in nonparametric identi. cation of mea- surement error models and their applications in applied microeconomics, in particular, in empirical industrial organization and labor economics. <b>Measurement</b> <b>error</b> models describe mappings from a latent distribution to an observed distribution. The identification and estimation of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> models focus on how to obtain the latent distribution and the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> distribution from the observed distribution. Such a framework may be suitable for many microeconomic models with latent variables, such as models with unobserved heterogeneity or unobserved state variables and panel data models with fixed effects. Recent developments in <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> models allow very flexible specification of the latent distribution and the <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> distribution. These developments greatly broaden economic applications of <b>measurement</b> <b>error</b> models.

25|$|However, the JRASC {{article has}} been criticized as lacking any error analysis.

It was also pointed out that the photos used actually show the fireball trail becoming progressively thinner, suggesting motion away from the cameras, or in the direction of Pennsylvania. Had the trajectory been sideways to the cameras, as contended in the JRASC article, the trail would likely have remained roughly constant in thickness.|$|E
