40|$|Abstract—This paper aims to {{recognize}} <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> from {{three types of}} valid identification documents in China: the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driver license of motor vehicle. We have proposed an approach using local similarity voting to automatically recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers.</b> Firstly, we extract the candidate region which contains <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and then locate the numbers and characters. Secondly, we recognize the numbers by an improved template matching method based on the local similarity voting. Finally, we verify the <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and characters. We have applied the proposed approach {{to a set of}} about 100 images which are shot by conventional digital cameras. The experimental results have demonstrated that this approach is efficient and is robust to the change of illumination and rotation. The recognition accuracy is up to 98 %.

50|$|This concept can be {{illustrated}} with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> to their employees. X {{should not have}} two employees with the same <b>ID</b> <b>number,</b> and likewise for Y; {{but it is not}} a problem for the same <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of identification (<b>ID)</b> <b>numbers</b> in <b>ID</b> card {{is very important}} in real applications. In this paper, we have proposed a novel algorithm based on random forests to recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> in the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driving ID card. Firstly we obtain the region of interest by the minimum cross-entropy in spatial domain and determine the type of ID card according to the position of face. After using vertical projection and horizontal projection, we separate <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> into different characters and apply random forests to recognize character patches. Additionally, a supplemental method with the encoding rules of <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> is introduced to further improve recognition performance. The experiments executed on a challenging dataset have shown that the proposed algorithm has low complexity in computation and a high accuracy rate in recognizing three types of ID cards. Moreover, this algorithm is robust to the changes of illumination, rotation and image distortion...|$|R
