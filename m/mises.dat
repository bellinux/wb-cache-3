50|$|Tabu Ram Taid (টাবু ৰাম টাইড, टाबु राम टाइड) {{known as}} 'Tabu Taid', is an Indian educationist, linguist, author and administrator. He {{was born in}} Ghunasuti Ayengia, a small <b>Mising</b> village in present-day Lakhimpur {{district}} in Assam, India on 1 August 1942. His father was (late) Ubbang Taid. Hailing from the <b>Mising</b> community, a small indigenous tribe of Assam, India, and from an economically challenged and geographically remote village 'Ghunasuti Ayengia', the challenges and obstacles to his formal education were many, but he pursued education single-mindedly nonetheless and eventually earned a Post Graduate degree from Delhi University, which was quite uncommon in his community at that time.Starting {{his career as a}} lecturer of English language in Cotton College, Guwahati, he further proceeded to obtain a Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Linguistics from the University of Reading, UK, and also successfully completed a course in Distance Teaching at University of London Institute of Education, UK. He served in various senior level posts in various educational arms of the Government of Assam. He was the founder President of the <b>Mising</b> Agom Kebang (Linguistic Society of the <b>Mising,</b> also known as <b>Mising</b> Sahitya Sabha), the apex body of the <b>Mising</b> community aiming for the preservation and development of the <b>Mising</b> language. His body of work includes the 'Mising Gompir Kumsung' (a 900-page dictionary of the <b>Mising</b> language with an introduction to <b>Mising</b> grammar), 'EkuNki nibondho', a collection of selected articles written in Assamese, 'Glimpses', a collection of articles written in English, research work on the <b>Mising</b> and Assamese language, editorial work on traditional <b>Mising</b> literary artifacts like folk songs, along with lexicographical works like dictionary, grammar and phonology of the <b>Mising</b> language.His work on his mother tongue, <b>Mising,</b> is his invaluable contribution to the <b>Mising</b> community and also to the Assamese people and culture at large.|$|R
5|$|The Austrian School of {{economics}} began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von <b>Mises</b> and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von <b>Mises</b> along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining {{the word and}} advancing {{the concept of the}} entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von <b>Mises,</b> Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I have {{examined}} the French nominal multi-word unit <b>mise</b> en N and its many variants in a dynamic perspective {{on the basis of}} data collected from French language online newspapers between 2006 and 2007. In its most general sense, <b>mise</b> en N means ‘the action of putting somewhere, or the result of this action’ and is closely related to the verb mettre and the multi-word verb construction mettre en N (‘to put’/’to put somewhere’). It is a common and productive lexical form used in specialised as well as in general language. As an old lexical construction stretching back to Latin through Middle and Old French, it has a wide range of semantic content and features, and can be interpreted in different ways. However, existing studies of <b>mise</b> en N often consider its variants either as fixed expressions or as intrinsically belonging to the verb category. The objective {{of this study was to}} show that the scope of <b>mise</b> en N is much wider than this and that its variation can be seen as a result of the dynamic properties inherent to the construction that <b>mise</b> en N represent. To do this, the construction was studied from a nominal perspective as a proper lexical unit, where its variants were considered as multi-word nouns denoting an action; and, due to its many variants, it was also studied through an approach which included dynamic or unstable linguistic features, by considering <b>mise</b> en N as a nominal multi-word construction. therefore adopted a multi-methodological approach where 247 variants of the <b>mise</b> en N construction were studied in a dynamic corpus of data derived from online newspapers through the linguistic search engine GlossaNet. The variants were analysed in different perspectives (semantic content, morphosyntactic properties, frequency of use) and various linguistic and lexicographic sources (traditional dictionaries, online and dynamic dictionaries, term bases, the Web) were used to complement and evaluate the corpus findings. The analysis was based on a set of morphosyntactic, morphological and semantic evaluation criteria, and was systematised in an analyse table inspired by the lexicon grammar model developed by Maurice Gross (1975). Our analyses resulted in 271 identified <b>mise</b> en N variants, that is variants identified with a specific meaning and set of properties and thus provided with an individual entry in the table. Our findings show that <b>mise</b> en N can be seen as having a double lexical status: <b>mise</b> en N as a fixed multi-word expression (unité figée); and <b>mise</b> en N as a fixed multi-word construction (construction figée). As a fixed expression, a <b>mise</b> en N variant has become a part of the lexicon as a regular lexical unit, with a fixed form and meaning. The fixed <b>mise</b> en N variants were grouped in a separate category labeled locutions figées (LF). As a fixed construction, I consider <b>mise</b> en N as a lexical pattern that can be used to create other variants, and that can perhaps also explain its continuous variation and productivity. In addition it can be considered to have a more functional role which might indicate an ongoing grammaticalisation process. The analyses identified four types of <b>mise</b> en N constructions: type A where <b>mise</b> en N is linked to the verb mettre in a locative sense (‘to put (something) somewhere’), ex. <b>mise</b> en pots; type B including <b>mise</b> en N variants linked to the causative verbs rendre/faire devenir (‘to make (someone/something) become’), ex. <b>mise</b> en accessibilité; type C including variants linked to the factitive verb faire (‘to make (someone/something) do’), ex. <b>mise</b> en circulation; type D including a heterogenous group of <b>mise</b> en N that can be linked to a variety of verbs, ex. <b>mise</b> en emploi, <b>mise</b> en peinture, <b>mise</b> en tourisme. The types can also be characterised by the type of action they imply. Type A and B would have an affected object with a passive function, the affected objet of type C would be active; however, type D can be said to denote the sense of action more generally, i. e. providing the sense of action and of duration to something that is lacking it, or where the sense of action is ambiguous, as in the case of action nouns that can be interpreted as an process, an event or as the result of the action. </p...|$|R
