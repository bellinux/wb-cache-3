25|$|Originally, {{the conspirators}} hoped {{to force the}} abdication of the King Carlos I, but decided on proclaiming a {{republic}} as the better goal.

In its final version, brigades of Carbonária would neutralize the lines of communication, the mounted cavalry in the Largo do Carmo, the Municipal Guard in the Largo dos Lóios, the barracks in the Cabeço de Bola and the naval officers in the Vale de Zebo, while the remaining conspirators would take the <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> buildings and eliminate João Franco.|$|E

25|$|Tamil Nadu {{has been}} a {{pioneering}} state of E-Governance initiatives in India.

25|$|A bilingual (Punic and Berber) urban {{inscription}} of the 2nd century BC from Berber Numidia, specifically {{from the}} city of Thugga (modern Dougga, Tunisia), indicates a complex city administration, with the Berber title GLD (corresponding to modern Berber Aguellid, or paramount tribal chief) being the ruling <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> of the city government; this office apparently rotated among the members of leading Berber families. Circa 220 BC, in the early light given us by historical accounts, three large kingdoms had arisen among the Berbers of North Africa (west to east): (1) the Mauri (in modern Morocco) under king Baga; (2) the Masaesyli (in northern Algeria) under Syphax who ruled from two capitals, Siga (near modern Oran) and to the east Cirta (modern Constantine); and (3) the Massyli (south of Cirta, west and south of Carthage) ruled by Gala, father of Masinissa. Later Masinissa would receive full honors befitting an important leader from both Roman and Hellenic states. Berber ethnic identities were maintained during the long periods of dominance by Carthage and Rome.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{plans for}} a {{consolidated}} <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> building were approved by the city council in February 1963, with the $320,000 cost being funded with regular tax income, rather than a bond measure as previously attempted.

The three-story building, which would serve as Bellevue's city hall, was dedicated on March 7, 1964, by Governor Albert D. Rosellini. A public library was opened adjacent to the municipal building in 1967, as part of the development of the [...] civic center campus.|$|E

500|$|Local {{historic}} {{districts are}} identified by surveying historic resources and delineating appropriate boundaries that comply with {{all aspects of}} due process. Depending on local ordinance or State law, property owners permission may be required; however all owners are to be notified and {{given a chance to}} share their opinion. Most local historic districts are constricted by design guidelines that control changes to the properties included in the district. Many local commissions adopt specific guidelines for the [...] "tout ensemble" [...] of each neighborhood, although some smaller commissions rely on the Secretary of Interior Standards. For most minor changes, homeowners can consult with local preservation staff at the <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> and receive guidance on and permission for the changes. Major changes however, require homeowners to apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA), and the changes may be decided upon by the historic commission or architectural review board. The COA process is carried out with all aspects of due process, with formal notification, hearings, and fair and informed decision making.|$|E
500|$|The {{vote was}} held on Saturday 23 April 1887, with the booths open for twelve hours from eight in the morning. There were seven polling {{stations}} across Taunton, which was busy as it was market day. The Taunton Courier reported that party colours of both sides were on display, but {{that there was more}} [...] "Conservative blue" [...] than the tri-colour and Union Jack of the Liberals. Campaigning continued throughout the day, but was conducted in a civil manner. Two hours into the voting it was announced that a third of the constituency had voted, and the Conservatives declared that they were leading by a ratio of two to one. Bad weather {{in the middle of the}} day caused a lull in the voting, but the polls were very busy throughout the afternoon when the weather cleared, as most of the town only worked half of the day. Based upon their polling on the day, the Conservatives continued to claim victory during the afternoon. The votes were counted in the <b>Municipal</b> <b>Office,</b> and the results were announced at quarter-past nine in the evening. Allsopp received 1,426 votes to Sanders' 890, granting him a 536 majority. Both Allsopp and Sanders spoke briefly to praise the Returning Officer, and Allsopp was then called upon to give a speech. During that speech, Allsopp thanked the people of Taunton, and gently mocked Sanders for the money he had banked in case of corruption.|$|E
