40|$|Objectives. Neutropenia is an {{uncommon}} albeit relevant finding {{in patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has been ascribed to several aetiologies and represents a challenging dilemma in which clinical findings, laboratory data and medication history must be carefully evaluated. The aim of this work was to review the cases of moderate and severe neutropenia in our cohort of SLE patients {{in order to identify}} predisposing factors, clinical outcomes and related prognostic implications. Methods. Thirty-three cases of neutropenia (neutrophil count < 1000 /ll) in patients with SLE were included. Sixty-five age-and sex-matched patients with SLE served as controls. Information was obtained by medical chart review. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, paired t-test, v 2 or Fisher’s exact test, and logistic regression. Results. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Use of concomitant medications and immunosuppressive drugs, as well as history of thrombocytopenia and central nervous system involvement, were associated with an increased risk for developing neutropenia. Along with neutropenia, cases had lower haemoglobin and platelet values and higher levels of liver enzymes. Moreover, disease activity was lower than in controls. One month after the neutropenia event, leucocyte and total granulocyte counts were still lower in patients than in controls. Mortality did not differ between patients with neutropenia and controls. Conclusions. Most episodes of severe granulocytopenia in SLE patients occur as part of drug toxicity-induced <b>medullar</b> <b>hypoplasia...</b>|$|E
