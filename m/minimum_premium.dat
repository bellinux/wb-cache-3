50|$|VUL {{policies}} {{have a great}} deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit. The <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer. To maintain a death benefit guarantee, that specified premium level must be paid every month. To keep the policy in force, typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that month's cost of insurance. The maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance. Internal Revenue Code section 7702 sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid (both in a given year, and over certain periods of time) for a given death benefit. The most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit. Then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value. In the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component, and was entirely cash value. If it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter, pure investment returns and no insurance cost. In fact when variable universal life policies first became available in 1986, contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits. In order to curb this practice, but still encourage life insurance purchase, the IRS developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how a high {{overtime}} {{wage rate}} {{and a low}} labor stock {{may be used as}} commitment devices by price-setting firms. We show that high overtime pay premiums may both decrease and increase equilibrium employment. If an employment-oriented union or the firm itself sets the overtime wage, then the overtime wage premium will be high enough to ensure that no overtime is used in equilibrium. If the overtime wage is set by a sufficiently wage-oriented union, however, overtime will be used in equilibrium, and employment is substantially lower. Thus the authorities may be able to increase employment if it can make a union act in a less wage-oriented manner.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{the cost of}} {{providing}} insurance coverage against natural and man-made hazards. We propose an insurance market model that explains (1) the use of reinsurance to help finance the cost of catastrophic events and (2) the implicit (or explicit) presence of government entities acting as (re) insurers of last resort. Using an economic model, we show how insurance programmes should be designed to cover the losses due to a possible catastrophic natural hazard.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the well-known literature dealing with the existence of equilibrium in competitive insurance markets under adverse selection (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976) by analyzing the case in which insurers face capacity constraints and a <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> constraint. The model presented features two types of consumers (high and low risk) who must buy insurance, {{and a number of}} homogeneous risk-neutral, capacity-constrained insurers subject to a regulation that imposes both a <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> and coverage. The main finding here is that, under certain conditions, there exists a range of equilibria, most of which result in positive profits for all firms – profits that entry does not dissipate. The intuition is easiest to grasp by considering the case in which a deviating offer intends to attract both type of consumers (Inderst and Wambach, 2001) : to obtain a profit on low-risk individuals, the offer must specify a higher coverage than the Rothschild-Stiglitz contract, but such an offer would be most attractive to high-risk types – given the expected level of congestion at the deviating firm, low risks will not apply for the offer, implying that the deviator would make a loss. The imposition of a <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> constrains further the kinds of deviations that would be considered and facilitates more collusive outcomes in which firms obtain positive profits...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} are considering {{the option of}} reducing the share of mandatory health insurance (MHI) and to increasingly rely on voluntary (supplementary) health insurance (VHI) schemes to cover health care expenditures. It is well-known that competitive markets for VHI tend to risk-rated premiums. After discussing the determinants of riskrating in competitive VHI markets, we provide empirical evidence of the potential reduction of (risk-) solidarity caused by the transfer of benefits from MHI to VHI coverage. For this purpose, we simulate several scenarios in which benefits covered by MHI are transferred to competitive markets for VHI. We use a dataset issued by the largest insurer in the Netherlands, in order to calculate the potential premium range for VHI resulting from this transfer. Our findings show that, by adding risk-factors, the <b>minimum</b> VHI <b>premium</b> decreases while the maximum increases. Moreover, we observe that risk-rating primarily affects the maximum premium. The reduction of solid arity is especially substantial for benefits such as medical devices and drugs. Finally we discuss some options to maintain a socially acceptable level of solidarity in VHI markets. solidarity, competition, risk-rating, supplementary health insurance, risk-adjustment. ...|$|R

Domestic {{road transport}} of passengers in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} provisions of the Obligations Act of 2005 providing for the contracts of passenger transport, since, so far, there is no lex specialis applying to road transport. Among other things, these provisions recognise carriers’ rights to the limitation of liability for property and non-property damages suffered by passengers, such as death, bodily injury or impairment of health. However, information regarding the amounts can be found in other acts or international conventions. According to the CVR Convention providing for the international transport of passengers, the specific amounts of limitation are expressed in Germinal francs which can be calculated in two ways: through the stock-exchange price of gold or through the value of a special drawing right (SDR). In the case of the latter method, the limitation amounts in SDRs, envisaged in the CVR Protocol of 1978 (still not effective), must be applied. The amounts calculated by the first method practically annul the right of carriers to any limitation, whereas the amounts calculated by the second method are more than ten times smaller and constitute a realistic and acceptable possibility of limiting liability with respect to the achievable amounts for similar events in Croatia. Such liability of carriers is covered by compulsory insurance of auto-liability up to the <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> provided in the law. This amount (about EUR 900, 000) is far from sufficient to cover big accidents involving an average-sized coach full of passengers (50 passenger seats). For the remaining amount of damage, the carrier is liable alone. In this paper, it is recommended to contract voluntary insurance against liability arising from transport activity, or to contract auto-liability insurance of a higher amount. In addition, according to the new Compulsory Insurance in Traffic Act, every passenger, cumulatively with this right arising from a transport contract, exercises his or her right to a premium {{on the basis of the}} compulsory insurance of passengers in public transport amounting to a range from EUR 5. 5 – 11, 000 for every injury in the vehicle, regardless of the cause...|$|E
40|$|Non-life {{insurance}} pricing {{depends on}} different costs including claim and business acquisition costs, management expenses and other parameters such as margin for fluctuations in claims experience, expected profits etc. Nevertheless, {{in a competitive}} insurance market environment, company's premium should respond {{to changes in the}} level of premiums being offered by competitors. In this thesis, two major issues are being investigated. Primarily, it is explored how a company's optimal strategy can be determined in a competitive market and secondly a connection between this strategy and market's competition is established. More specifically, two functional equations for the volume of business are proposed. In the first place, the volume of business function is related to the past year's experience, the average premium of the market, the company's premium and a stochastic disturbance. Thus, an optimal premium strategy which maximizes the total expected linear discounted utility of company's wealth over a finite time horizon is defined analytically and endogenously. In the second place, the volume of business function is enriched with company's reputation, for the first time according to the author's knowledge. Moreover, the premium elasticity and reputation elasticity of the volume of business are taking into consideration. Thus, an optimal premium strategy which maximizes the total expected linear discounted utility of company's wealth over a finite time horizon is calculated and for some special cases analytical solutions are presented. Furthermore, an upper bound or a <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> excess strategy is found for a company with positive reputation and positive premium elasticity of the volume of business. Thirdly, the calculation of a fair premium in a competitive market is discussed. A nonlinear premium-reserve (P-R) model is presented and the premium is derived by minimizing a quadratic performance criterion concerns the present value of the reserve. The reserve is a stochastic equation, which includes an additive random nonlinear function of the state, premium and not necessarily Gaussian noise which is independently distributed in time, provided only that the mean value and the covariance of the random function is zero and a quadratic function of the state, premium and other parameters, respectively. In this quadratic representation of the covariance function, new parameters are implemented and enriched further the previous linear models, such as the income insurance elasticity of demand, the number of insured and the inflation in addition to the company's reputation. Interestingly, for the very first time, the derived optimal premium in a competitive market environment is also depended on the company's reserve among the other parameters. In each chapter numerical applications show the applicability of the proposed models and their results are further explained and analyzed. Finally, suggestions for further research and summary of the conclusions complete the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Niche {{markets of}} {{agricultural}} products are experiencing rapid growth. One such market is organic pork. Organic production typically demands specific production conditions {{that can be}} cost increasing. This study evaluates the cost of organic pork production, seasonal differences in costs, and premiums necessary to induce continuous organic pork production. In the past few years, niche marketing has been a rapidly growing phenomenon in agriculture. One area that has experienced dramatic growth is the production of organic products. Organic production typically brings with it specific conditions on how the product is produced. These can impact the cost structure of the business and in turn, needed premiums for economic production. One of these niche markets that are growing rapidly is the market for organic pork. A major issue in organic pork production is the differing cost structures across the seasons of the year which relates, in part, to the types of production systems allowed or disallowed. Studies have shown that consumers are very conscientious of product price, freshness, and availability. In the production of organic pork, {{we are able to}} demonstrate that there are cost savings to the producer by producing a seasonal product over a continuous product. While this allows for a lower cost for the producer, it causes an uneven pig flow problem throughout the vertical chain which affects packers, marketers, and consumers. The packers are affected by having their plants at full capacity only part of the year. For the consumer, there are certain times of the year when the product is in surplus and other times when it is in shortage causing prices to fluctuate greatly. This implies that both the consumer and the packer may have an incentive to induce the producer to provide a continuous supply of organic pork to the market. This study has two objectives. The first is to provide a detailed analysis of the producer's cost of producing organic pork in a seasonal and continuous production system. The second objective is to develop a premium structure that could induce a producer to adopt a continuous production system. The study addresses the issue by examining the increase of costs involved in expanding a seasonal (summer only farrowing) organic pork production system to continuous production of organic hogs. Production costs differ by production system and season of the year. Organic pork production cost per hundred pounds is projected to be $ 59. 45 for the seasonal system. The seasonal system consists of farrowing in the summer time only. This cost can be compared to a continuous system of organic pork production with a cost of $ 63. 88 per hundred pounds. The continuous system has farrowing occurring in both the winter and summer seasons. With the current premium structures for organic pork, there are more hogs being produced using summer farrowing than by winter farrowing. Consumers prefer a more uniform supply of fresh pork. To foster a more uniform supply of fresh organic pork throughout the year, premiums received by producers need to reflect the seasonal production costs differences. Our results show that if the producer is paid the continuous system's cost of production of $ 63. 88, the producer would have an incentive to produce only seasonal hogs. To induce the producer to provide a continuous flow of hogs, a <b>minimum</b> <b>premium</b> of $ 7. 47 beyond the seasonal price must be paid to the producer for producing hogs in the winter, and a premium of $ 1. 66 must be paid in the summer. An alternative is that the producer would receive no premium for summer production and a premium of $ 9. 13 per hundred pounds over the seasonal production costs to induce the producer to produce a continuous supply of hogs.

40|$|Forest {{certification}} is {{a voluntary}} verification tool {{that has been}} gaining importance within the global sustainability issues as an independent verification tool for sustainable forest management and wood processing industry and as an influencer in private and public purchasing policies and a component of emerging wood harvesting and trade legality schemes. This study focuses on the chain-of-custody (CoC) component of forest certification. A survey of CoC certified companies in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out to explore {{the understanding of the}} concept and role of forest and CoC certification as an environmental, economic, and social tool. It aimed to determine expectations following from the implementation of CoC certification by companies and to identify difficulties in existing certified wood product supply chains and costs related to purchase and sales of certified forest products, respectively. Results indicate that respondents demonstrated a high level of understanding of the CoC concept and that they link forest certification mainly to the issues of legality, tracing the origin source of supply and promotion of sustainable utilisation of wood. The main expected benefits are linked to the improvement of an external company image followed by penetration of new markets and increase of sales volume. CoC is not considered a tool to improve internal company performance and efficiency. The key problems connected to certified supply chains relate to the sufficient quantity of certified forest products, low margins and overpriced certified material inputs. Respondents reported none or <b>minimum</b> price <b>premiums</b> for their certified products over non-certified alternatives. Several differences related {{to the understanding of the}} sustainable forest management concept and the level of price premium paid for certified inputs were identified between the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified companies as well as between the different forest products sectors...|$|R
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis is to analyze the impact of supply chain of {{perishable}} agricultural products on income derived from vegetables. The study is conducted particularly focusing on irrigation cooperatives located in the southern zone of Tigray. This {{is due to the}} highest number of irrigation cooperatives members in the region. Among the vegetables the particular emphasis of the study is on income derived from three vegetables. These are onion, potato and tomato. These vegetables are preferred, on one hand for the reason that they are major sources of income in irrigation cooperatives, {{and on the other hand}} for the reason that there are so many constraints in relation to the perishable nature of the products which affects the producer’s income. A total of 120 households from vegetables producers irrigation cooperatives (16 female headed households and 104 male headed households) drawn from two southern zone Woredas. To collect the necessary data for the analysis structured and pre tested questionnaires are used. Focused group discussion and key informant interview are also conducted. Secondary data on basic agricultural and population is also collected to strengthen the analysis. The analysis is conducted using descriptive statistics and empirically. The analysis of the collected data showed that most of the households are illiterate (40. 8 %). The average age of the households is 40. 03 years. The average family size is about 5. 41 of which the active labor force is 3. The average land holding is about 0. 47 hectare per household of which 0. 25 hectares of land on averages used for vegetable production per household. The average ownership of livestock is 4. 34 TLU. The majority of the households in the study area become a member of irrigation cooperative voluntarily. The majority of the households identified that irrigation water management and provision of fertilizer as a major benefit obtained from the cooperative. The average years of experience as a vegetable producer of the households is 6. 7 years and as cooperative members the average years are 4. 6. The income sources of the households are both from agricultural and non agricultural income sources. The average income the households received in the crop year 2008 / 09 was 10, 672. 15 birr. Of the total income the average income from off farm activities was 1, 095. 25 (10. 26 %) birr. From agricultural activities the households on average received 1267. 45 (11. 9 %), 6, 719. 83 (62. 97 %), 1589. 61 (14. 9 %) and 6. 66 birr from crops, vegetables, livestock and bee colony respectively. The xvi total income received from sold onion, potato and tomatoes were 806, 380 birr in the study area. A total of 748 quintal of onion, 662 quintal of potato and 953 quintal of tomatoes were sold in the production year 2008 / 09. The average price received per quintal for onion, potato and tomatoes were 364. 34 birr, 352. 65 birr and 315. 20 birr respectively. This income was the highest income received by the households from agricultural income sources. From the identified market channels the channel that stretched as producer – wholesaler retailers, producer – cooperatives – wholesalers - consumers, and producer – wholesalers - out of region are some of the forms of supply chain used for vegetables by the produces. In the supply chain of vegetables wholesalers are found to be the dominant buyers of vegetables. Among the constraints of income from vegetables land size, fertilizer in terms of its cost, perishable nature of the product, shortage of improved seed, irrigation water shortage, storage, technical assistance both for production and marketing, lack of training from the cooperatives and disease and pests are among the major ten rated constraints of income from vegetables. The econometrics result for the determinants of income from vegetables, among the hypothesized seventeen variables six of them found significant. These are vegetable post harvest loss, crop income, distance from major market, distance from major road, off farm income and livestock income. Livestock income is the only variable which affects vegetable income positively. Post harvest loss and crop income are highly significant factors to affect income from vegetables. Other variables like land size, credit, extension service, price information and improved seeds are not significant as expected though they exhibited positive relationship with vegetable income. Based on the constraints to increase income from vegetables, improving the availability and developing ways in reducing the price of inputs, developing drought resistance varieties of seeds, developing crop insurance schemes with <b>minimum</b> <b>premiums,</b> developing farm plan budget, analyzing the cost benefit of market choice, analyzing the opportunity cost of crop and vegetable production are some of the recommendations suggested to increase income of the households in the production of vegetables...|$|R
40|$|World {{international}} trade is moving towards more free trade, through globalization and trade liberalization. These moves are guided by trade theories which state that on an aggregated level, nations involved in free trade should benefit, and further that free trade is fair. However, in practice, contradictory views have been raised, stating that free trade {{may not necessarily}} be benefiting all participants equally. Rather, other nations, especially developing nations, have become worse-off after opening up their markets for free trade. On the other hand, many developed nations have benefited substantially from free trade. Among other factors, the difference in benefits {{is believed to have been}} influenced by the types of commodities being traded (where developing nations mainly trade in primary goods and developed nations in anufactured goods) and unequal power relations (some nations for example, the EU and the US, still adopt protectionism in their agricultural sector). In order to address market imbalances resulting from free trade, Fairtrade has arisen. Fairtrade aims to improve international trading conditions in order to benefit small-scale farmers and farm workers in the developing nations. The Fairtrade organization further claims that its principles are in line with sustainable development. However, Fairtrade suffers a credibility gap because there is a lack of independent research to support their claims. To date in South Africa, there is little research examining the claims of the Fairtrade organization. In order to contribute to the Fairtrade discussion in South Africa, this study has investigated the validity of Fairtrade‘s claims that it contributes towards sustainable development. The study utilised primary data, which was collected from ten commercial farms and two small-scale farmer cooperatives located in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces that are/were Fairtrade certified. The main reason for including commercial farmers and small-scale farmer cooperatives in the study was for comparing relative impacts in the two Fairtrade structures. The data was then analysed using a sustainable livelihoods framework, which was developed in the study. The study focussed on investigating the impact of Fairtrade tools, which are <b>minimum</b> prices, <b>premiums,</b> pre-financing and support for long-term relationships, on its intended beneficiaries. Minimum prices offered to producers cover production costs and are above market prices, and Fairtrade premiums are to be invested in developmental projects. Therefore, examining the influence of Fairtrade tools on individuals and communities provides an overview of how Fairtrade influences development. The results of the study show that sampled Fairtrade beneficiaries in South Africa have witnessed substantial positive changes as a result of Fairtrade. The Fairtrade initiative has managed to empower small-scale producers and farm workers, as well as leverage development opportunities for their wider communities. It has supported organizational development in the supply chain, facilitated investment in community development projects and in business-related training. Producers, both commercial and small-scale producers, managed to access a market that offers stable prices, and have gained from minimum prices. Furthermore, small-scale farmers have been allowed an opportunity to expand their business into export markets, and enjoyed an increase in incomes. Fairtrade benefits further trickle down to non-Fairtrade community members, in the form of employment creation and community development. Despite positive effects, Fairtrade producers faced challenges, including high Fairtrade administration costs and a small market for Fairtrade commodities. The study concludes that in the face of challenges, Fairtrade brings economic, social and environmental benefits, but as compared to economic and social development, the impact on environmental development is rather limited. Even though that is the case, Fairtrade offers valuable development opportunities to producers in South Africa. ...|$|R
