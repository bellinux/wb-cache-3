40|$|Neuromuscular {{disorders}} can be {{subdivided into}} anterior horn cell disorders, neuropathies, myasthenic disorders and myopathies. Some multisystem disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>encephalomyopathies,</b> are traditionally also included. The frequency in childhood of these disorders {{in general and}} of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>encephalomyopathies</b> in particular is not well known. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform an epidemiologic survey of neuromuscular disorders in children < 16 years of age from western Sweden. Cases were ascertained from different registers and medical records, investigations and diagnoses were reviewed in order to determine prevalence and incidence figures. A population-based study was conducted to describe the preschool incidence, point prevalence, mortality and the clinical spectrum of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>encephalomyopathies</b> in childhood. In addition, a large family with a new type of congenital myopathy was investigated to characterize the clinical, muscle morphologic and genetic features of the disorder. In children of school age (6 - 15 years) the point prevalence was 79. 8 x 10 - 5 for all neuromuscular disorders, 66. 5 x 10 - 5 for hereditary neuromuscular disorders and 19. 9 x 10 - 5 for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. The incidences of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy type I, spinal muscular atrophy type II, congenital myopathy and congenital myotonic dystrophy were estimated to be 21. 5 x 10 - 5, 4. 1 x 10 - 5, 1. 0 x 10 - 5, 5. 8 x 10 - 5 and 5. 2 x 10 - 5 respectively. The incidence of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>encephalomyopathies</b> in preschool children (< 6 years of age) was 8. 9 x 10 - 5, while the point prevalence in children < 16 years of age was 4. 7 x 10 - 5. The median survival among cases with infantile onset was up to 12 years of age. The most common disorders were Leigh syndrome, Alpers syndrome and infantile mitochondrial myopathy with cytochrome C-oxidase deficiency. The investigated congenital myopathy showed autosomal dominant heredity with full penetrance. Characteristic clinical features were congenital joint contractures which normalized during early childhood, external ophthalmoplegia and proximal muscle weakness. The course was frequently progressive in adulthood. The major histopathologic changes in skeletal muscle in childhood were focal disorganization of myofilaments and type 2 A-fiber hypoplasia. In adults with progressive muscle weakness, the muscle biopsies showed rimmed vacuoles with inclusions of 15 - 21 nm filaments. Linkage analysis, haplotype/recombination analysis and radiation hybrid mapping showed that the locus is located in 17 p 13 and that a myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) gene cluster colocalizes to the same region. DNA sequencing and mutation screening of the MyHC IIa gene identified a missense mutation, Glu 706 Lys, in a highly conserved region of the motor domain. Conclusions: Neuromuscular disorders appear to be more common in childhood than has been reported in previous studies. Our findings in a population-based study indicate that <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>encephalomyopathies</b> are relatively common neurometabolic disorders in childhood. There was a predominance of infantile and encephalopathic disorders with high mortality. A new congenital myopathy, which may be regarded as a variant of hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM) was characterized. This is the first identification of a genetic defect in an h-IBM and also the first human myopathy associated with a mutation in a fast MyHC gene...|$|R
40|$|Haematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} {{has been proposed}} as treatment for <b>mitochondrial</b> neurogastrointestinal <b>encephalomyopathy,</b> a rare fatal autosomal recessive disease due to TYMP mutations that result in thymidine phosphorylase deficiency. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all known patients suffering from <b>mitochondrial</b> neurogastrointestinal <b>encephalomyopathy</b> who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2005 and 2011. Twenty-four patients, 11 males and 13 females, median age 25 years (range 10 - 41 years) treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related (n = 9) or unrelated donors (n = 15) in 15 institutions worldwide were analysed for outcome and its associated factors. Overall, 9 of 24 patients (37. 5 %) were alive at last follow-up with a median follow-up of these surviving patients of 1430 days. Deaths were attributed to transplant in nine (including two after a second transplant due to graft failure), and to <b>mitochondrial</b> neurogastrointestinal <b>encephalomyopathy</b> in six patients. Thymidine phosphorylase activity rose from undetectable to normal levels (median 697 nmol/h/mg protein, range 262 - 1285) in all survivors. Seven patients (29 %) who were engrafted and living more than 2 years after transplantation, showed improvement of body mass index, gastrointestinal manifestations, and peripheral neuropathy. Univariate statistical analysis demonstrated that survival was associated with two defined pre-transplant characteristics: human leukocyte antigen match (10 / 10 versus < 10 / 10) and disease characteristics (liver disease, history of gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction or both). Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can restore thymidine phosphorylase enzyme function in patients with <b>mitochondrial</b> neurogastrointestinal <b>encephalomyopathy</b> and improve clinical manifestations of <b>mitochondrial</b> neurogastrointestinal <b>encephalomyopathy</b> in the long term. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered for selected patients with an optimal donor...|$|R
