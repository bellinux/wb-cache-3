40|$|Snags (standing dead trees) provide {{important}} habitat for forest wildlife, {{as well as}} a source of coarse woody debris important in forest succession. Because of their importance, some land-management agencies have <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> snag <b>retention</b> on lands under their jurisdiction (e. g. U. S. Forest Service, British Columbia Ministry of Forestry). Despite these guidelines, however, little information is typically available on snag numbers or dynamics on these lands. As part of a long-term effort to monitor snag dynamics, snag populations were sampled on 114 1 -ha plots randomly located across six Ranger Districts on two National Forests in northern Arizona. Sixty plots were located in ponderosa pine forest, with the remainder in mixed-conifer forest. Small snags and snags in later decay classes numerically dominated snag populations. Because large snags are most useful to forest wildlife, this suggests a need to retain large trees as future snags. Only 6. 7 and 16. 7 % of plots in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively, met or exceeded current U. S. Forest Service <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>retention</b> of large snags (de®ned as snags 46 cm in diameter at breast height and 9 m in height) in this geographic region. Even plots with no evidence of timber or fuelwood harvest seldom met targets <b>for</b> <b>retention</b> of large snags, however. Only 30 and 32 % of unlogged plots met or exceeded standards in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively. This suggests that current <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> snag <b>retention</b> may be unrealistic, and that those standards may need to be reconsidered.

40|$|I present three {{essays on}} the {{economics}} of sport, examining salary discrimination in Major League Baseball (MLB), determinants of dismissals of college football coaches, and star player effects on attendance in the National Basketball Association (NBA). New Evidence of Salary Discrimination in Major League Baseball Salary discrimination in MLB has largely been discarded as a research topic. However traditional quantitative methods (particularly least squares regression) have concentrated {{on the effect of}} race for the average player. This is not where we should expect to find discrimination, as the relative cost of discriminating against a better player is surely higher. I use quantile regression to uncover salary discrimination against black players in {{the lower half of the}} salary distribution. Not only are the premia for white and Hispanic players statistically significant, but they are large: up to 25 % for the bottom quintile of players. I also demonstrate that racial effects may be obscured in typical baseball salary regressions when they suffer from omitted variable bias, brought about by failing to properly consider speed and fielding ability. Win or Go Home: Why College Football Coaches Get Fired Models of dismissals of sports executives frequently ignore the development of expectations regarding performance. I explore the interplay between these expectations and the coachs tenure by examining dismissals of college football head coaches from 1983 to 2006. Using a discrete-time hazard model, I demonstrate that schools use prior performance in two ways: to evaluate the ability of the coach, and to establish performance <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>retention.</b> As recent performance is more relevant for estimating ability, I show that stronger recent performances decrease the chance of dismissal, but stronger historic performances increase the chance of dismissal. Results describe a continual learning process on the part of schools. I also consider the effects of race, insider-ness, rivalries, and rules violations on retention. Day to Day with the NBA Superstars I use censored regression (Tobit) analysis on NBA game-level attendance data to examine the superstar externality effect identified by Berri and Schmidt (2006) : star players increase road attendance, and since home teams (at least in the NBA) retain 100 % of the gate revenues, this constitutes an externality. Game-level data has several advantages over the season-level data employed by Berri and Schmidt: the ability to directly control for sellouts, estimation of dynamic intra-season attendance effects, and the lack of sensitivity to star player distribution. A new intra-season effect estimated is a superstar substitution effect accounting for a star???s negative effect on attendance at adjacent games, partially mitigating the superstar externality...|$|R
40|$|Background. Relapse {{following}} {{orthodontic treatment}} {{is a constant}} concern of orthodontists. Fixed retention is preferred especially for the lower arch by most orthodontists. Objectives. This review focuses on in vivo studies. The main objective {{is to determine the}} survival rates of different types of retainer: glass-fiber reinforced composite resin, polyethylene or multistrand stainless steel wire bonded to each tooth from canine to canine in the mandibular arch. A second objective is to assess which of these types is less likely to cause additional problems and the third objective is to evaluate the factors that may influence retainer survival. Results and conclusions. There were 8 studies identified that matched the objectives stated. Current in vivo studies on survival rate take little notice {{of the role of the}} material used for bonding of the fixed retainer. It is not possible to draw a conclusion on reliability of new types of retainers glass fiber reinforced composite resin or polyethylene compared to multistrand stainless steel wire.

As choline esters are not available by a commercial way, we decided to synthesise different aromatic choline esters (36). The structure of the acidic part of all the choline esters prepared are derived from benzoic or cinnamic acids with hydroxy or methoxy substituants in ortho, para or meta position. Pure aromatic choline esters were synthesised according to a fast method using bromocholine bromide. An aromatic acid (in excess) in methanol is first neutralised by NaOH (0. 1 N). Then bromocholine bromide in methanol is added in the evaporation flask. Solvent is evaporated to dryness using a rotative evaporator Büchi (40 °C).

The choline ester is taken up with 2 x 3 ml of distilled water and purified on a SP Sephadex C 25 - 120 resin. After washing with distilled water, the ester is eluted HCl (1 N). The elution is followed by measuring u. v. absorbance at 280 nm. The eluate is evaporated to dryness with a rotative evaporator (Büchi) and the crystals obtained are washed with acetone.

40|$|In {{the midst}} of ongoing debates within the legal academy and the American Bar Association {{on the need for}} 2 ̆ 2 practice-ready 2 ̆ 2 law school {{graduates}} through enhanced attention to law clinics and externships and on the status of faculty teaching in those courses, this report identifies and evaluates the most appropriate modes for clinical faculty appointments. Drawing on data collected through a survey of clinical program directors and faculty, the report analyzes the five most identifiable clinical faculty models: unitary tenure track; clinical tenure track; long-term contract; short-term contract; and clinical fellowships. It determines that, despite great strides in the growth of clinical legal education in the last 30 years, equality between clinical and non-clinical faculty remains elusive. Clinical faculty still lag behind non-clinical faculty in security of position and governance rights at most law schools. The report then identifies four core principles that should guide decisions about clinical faculty appointments: 1) clinical education is a foundational and essential component of legal education; 2) the legal academy and profession benefit from full inclusion of clinical faculty on all matters affecting the mission, function, and direction of law schools; 3) there is no justification for creating hierarchies between clinical and non-clinical faculty; and 4) the <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> hiring, <b>retention,</b> and promotion of clinical faculty must recognize and value the responsibilities and methodologies of clinical teaching. The report concludes that these core principles are best realized when full-time clinical faculty are appointed to a unitary tenure track. This conclusion does not ignore the imperfections of a tenure system. However, to the extent that tenure remains the strongest measure of the legal academy 2 ̆ 7 s investment in its faculty and is the surest guarantee of academic freedom, inclusion in faculty governance and job security, the report recommends that law schools predominantly place their clinical faculty on dedicated tenure lines. In addition, it recommends that schools implement <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> hiring, promotion, and retention that reflect the teaching responsibilities and methodologies, as well as practice and service obligations, unique to their clinical faculty. To facilitate the development of such standards, the report suggests good practices for the appointment of clinical faculty on a unitary tenure track...|$|R
