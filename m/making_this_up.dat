Witness Anne Marie Hannigan claimed that all of her statement had not been read out in court, a statement which she alleged was to have contradicted that of Garda Pádraig Jennings and Garda Pádraig Frawley. She told the inquest that the gardaí had used force when they were arresting Rossiter and his friend, Anthony O'Sullivan, denying that she was <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> for her own satisfaction. A GP described her shock and despair upon her discovery of Rossiter's comatose body. Brian Rossiter's father told the inquest that a detective garda had informed him that his son had taken as many as sixteen ecstasy tablets, was [...] "drunk out of his mind" [...] and [...] "as high as a kite", and yet later toxicology reports showed no evidence of this.|$|E

5000|$|After the titles, {{we see a}} {{screening}} of some incomprehensible parts of Hannaford's unfinished experimental film. The screening is being held to attract [...] "end money" [...] from clearly unimpressed studio boss Max David (Geoffrey Land). Hannaford himself is absent, and a loyal member of his entourage, the aging former child star Billy Boyle (Norman Foster) makes an inept attempt to describe what the film is about.

[...] After pointing out that a character in the Ring Cycle is the first woman that Siegfried has ever met who is not his aunt, she pauses and declares, [...] "I'm not <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up,</b> you know!" [...] This phrase also became the title of her autobiography, published in 1985. At the end of her monologue she sings the Rhinemaidens' leitmotif and declares, [...] "You're exactly where you started, 20 hours ago!" [...] Besides her Ring and Gilbert and Sullivan parodies, Russell was famous for other routines, including [...] "Wind Instruments I Have Known", and parodies of Lieder ("Schlumpf"), French art songs ("Je ne veux pas faire l'amour" [...] and [...] "Je n'ai pas la plume de ma tante"), English folk songs ("I Wish I Were a Dicky-Bird" [...] and [...] "Oh How I Love the Spring"), and English music-hall songs ("I'm Only A Faded Rose"); even stretching to blues and jazz ("(I Gave You My Heart and You Made Me) Miserable").|$|E

When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: [...] "I'm <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up,</b> I have no idea but here we go. I {{think that it would}} be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, like you have a window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn't open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost." ...|$|E
5000|$|Redbird Smith's son Stokes {{objected to}} his father's known reverence for (but not worship of) Jesus and the posthumous {{adoption}} of Jesus into the Keetoowah Society in 1936. Stokes Smith rejected this position in 1955: [...] "A very weird thing happened, politically speaking, in 1955. It {{had to do}} with Jesus Christ's membership in the Keetoowah Society (and no, we are not <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up).</b> The Nighthawks at the Redbird Smith Stomp Grounds were in civil strife. Stokes Smith, Redbird's youngest, was Chief. Before Redbird died, he told his people to incorporate the worship of Christ into Nighthawk religion. In 1936, the Keetoowah Society amended its constitution to recognized Christ. While Stokes had acquiesced and signed the measure, he and other elders were unhappy. William Lee Smith, current Nighthawk Chief at Stokes Smith's Grounds, says his father, Stokes, took the fire, wampum and pipe, and left the original grounds, but left part of the fire. The Redbird Grounds people then joined the UKB, realizing they could worship Christ and be Keetoowahs, and have the advantages of political recognition all at the same time, and God would not mind. Thereafter, Stokes' followers refused to recognize either the UKB or his other relatives at Redbirds, although Redbird is still an object of veneration. Some Keetoowah elders's say it was actually an adoption of Jesus into the Society and not an edict for the worship of Jesus.|$|E

Nosenko offered his services {{for a small}} amount of money, claiming that a prostitute had robbed him of $900 worth of Swiss francs. He claimed to be deputy chief of the Seventh Department of the KGB, and provided some information that would only be known by someone connected to the KGB. He was given the money he requested and told $25,000 a year would be deposited in an account in his name in the West. Then, at a meeting set up in 1964 he unexpectedly claimed that he had been discovered by the KGB and needed to defect immediately. Nosenko claimed that the Geneva KGB residency had received a cable recalling him to Moscow and he was fearful that he had been found out. NSA was later, but not at the time, able to determine that no such cable had been sent, and Nosenko subsequently admitted <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> to persuade the CIA to accept his defection, which the CIA did. Some relatives of Yuri Nosenko include Igor Stravinsky, who married his first cousin Katherine Nosenko. Other relatives of Yuri Nosenko, migrated to France from Ukraine, {{in order to avoid the}} persecution of Nazis and Russian communist. A relative of Yuri Nosenki, such as Nikita and Tarenta Nosenko, were helping victims of the Holocaust escape on their family farm in Poltava, Ukraine.

5000|$|Nikhil {{proposes to}} talk to Radhika just as {{a friend in the}} next {{scenario}} played out in Radhika’s mind, where he asks her if she has thought about the future and what she wants to do. He suggests calling Krish over since he wants to ask him a few questions. Radhika thinks this is futile and asks him what he would ask Krish. Nikhil starts off by asking an imaginary Krish seated in their apartment if he loved Radhika, to which Krish responds in the affirmative. Nikhil then asks Radhika if she and Krish have thought about their future, and is quite incredulous when she says that they haven’t discussed anything like that in the six months that the affair has been going on. Nikhil then poses another question to Krish asking him if he would marry Radhika. On Krish’s slight hesitation to answer this question, Nikhil totally dismisses him telling Radhika that that isn’t the way he is supposed to respond, but is to say, [...] "Of course, but I need some time". Nikhil then points out to Radhika that Krish has walked out of the door and explains to her that he is just looking out for her since he is concerned. Nikhil takes on a jealous, egoistic stand in the next imagery depicted, hitting Radhika with the fact that she might have had an affair for 6 months, while he has been having one with her sister Anita for the past five years. Radhika disregards his claims saying that he is acting juvenile, and <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> just for revenge. A discussion of how good Nikhil is in bed ensues, where Radhika compares him to Krish, saying that he has reduced her to a pair of breasts and one other part in bed, without a face, without arms, without a neck. She relates how Krish has opened up a whole new world to her by concentrating and spending hours on her neck, which she never knew was so sensitive. Nikhil asks her to swear on Sakshi that Krish is better than him in bed, and when she refuses to do so, hangs on to some words of hers uttered in another context, and uses them to massage his ego, interpreting the same to his own self that he is better in bed.|$|E

There are no treatises from the twelfth century, when the kingdom was at its height. The thirteenth-century jurists claimed that the kingdom had always had written laws, but they may have been <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> for {{political}} purposes. The treatises also discuss issues important to the noble class of which the jurists were a part: property rights and the feudal services owed to the king, as well as the proper way to plead their cases in court. But what do they say about criminal law, and laws for the lower classes? How were crimes tried and punished in the twelfth century, and did this differ from the laws recorded in the thirteenth century? Chapter one deals with the different treatises, and their claim that there was a set of laws called “Letres dou Sepulcre ”  in the twelfth century. The most important of the treatises for criminal law, the assizes of the burgess court, is examined in detail.
