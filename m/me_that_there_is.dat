25|$|Historically, {{citizenship}} in the Cherokee Nation {{has been an}} inclusive process; it was only {{at the time of}} the Dawes Commission there was ever a racial definition of what Cherokee meant. The fact that it was brought back up today certainly tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a statute of racism.|$|E
500|$|Much {{time and}} focus {{were given to}} animals, {{especially}} the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was {{very concerned about the}} health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not pay you to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing wrong with my animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|Dubnow himself adumbrates his own {{philosophical}} and religious understanding: [...] "I am agnostic in religion and in philosophy... I myself have {{lost faith in}} personal immortality, yet history teaches <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a collective immortality and that the Jewish people {{can be considered as}} relatively eternal for its history coincides with the full span of world history." [...] "Dubnow with his profound historical approach, weaves into his automomist theories all the strands of Jewish past, present and future." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{returned}} my glance, and {{it seemed}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some hidden meaning in his eyes which I failed to catch.|$|R
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a certain logic in female homosexuality. For if it is true, broadly speaking, we acquire our first sexual proclivities in infancy, girl {{children}} who are petted and fondled by their mothers, nurses and female relatives acquire what might be said to be a [...] "normal" [...] sexual affection for their own sex. But this is not true of male children, so it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a very fundamental difference between male and female homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1655 Monck {{received}} a letter from the future Charles II, a copy of which he at once sent to the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, who is said to have written to Monck in 1657: [...] "There be [...] that tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a certain cunning fellow in Scotland called George Monck, who is said to lye in wait there to introduce Charles Stuart; I pray you, use your diligence to apprehend him, and send him up to me." [...] Monck's personal relations with Cromwell were those of sincere friendship on both sides.|$|E
2500|$|On Wednesday, 11 March 2009, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees met and Mumford House was discussed. [...] Chairman Shah {{stated that}} [...] "Chancellor Herman has assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{intention}} of relocating Mumford House." [...] Shah and at least 4 other Trustees made strong statements {{in support of the}} house remaining in its original location. Board Secretary Michelle Thompson was instructed to draft a resolution for their next meeting, stating that the Mumford House shall remain in its original location permanently. [...] Shah requested that by the September meeting, which will be back in Urbana, that Mumford House be a board item and that Chancellor Herman have architectural plans for the house.|$|E

2500|$|Einaudi started {{composing}} his {{own music}} as a teenager, first writing by playing a folk guitar. He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, obtaining a diploma in composition in 1982. That same year he took an orchestration class taught by Luciano Berio and was awarded a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. According to Einaudi, [...] " [...] Berio did some interesting work with African vocal music and did some arrangements of Beatles songs, and he taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a sort of dignity inside music. I learnt orchestration from him and a very open {{way of thinking about}} music." [...] He also learned by collaborating with musicians such as Ballaké Sissoko from Mali and Djivan Gasparian from Armenia. [...] His music is ambient, meditative and often introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.|$|E
