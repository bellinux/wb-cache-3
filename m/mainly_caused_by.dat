5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the spectroscopic methods, {{above all}} {{infrared}} spectroscopy (IR), {{are the most}} frequently used analytical methods in the research of cultural beritage, whitch is <b>mainly</b> <b>cause</b> <b>by</b> easy use and noninvasiveness of these metods and a broad range of thein application, which comprises both organic and inorganic substances. Therefore, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the limitations of both Raman Spectroscopy (RS) and infrared spectroscopy in the study of earthy materials...|$|R

5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} World Tag Team Championship signalled {{the end of the}} team; in the {{following}} weeks, the pair began a losing streak, <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> The Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, The Hurricane did not show up in a World Tag Team title match leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, now going by his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner.|$|E

Injection of the DG into an electric power grid can affect the voltage quality. Distributed generation of different voltage levels when connected to the power system network could influence the voltage regulation, sustained interruptions, harmonics, sags, swells, etc. The role of CPDs in enhancing the integration of renewable and providing quality power through customs power park are described...|$|R
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, <b>mainly</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{objection}} of {{the present}} investigation is to elucidate the mechanism and causes of the movement of sand mold wall to find out methods for its prevention. High temperature compressive and pouring tests were performed to study the influences of various factors which caused mold wall movement in cement sand. The following factors were studied; cement and moisture content, the kind of cement, additives and molding process. Results obtained are as follows; (1) The amount of mold wall movement decreased with increasing cement content. (2) The amount of mold wall movement with moisture increasing moisture content under 8 percent, but contrary increased in the moisture above 10 percent. (3) Cement being changed from portland cement to special super high early strength cement, or black molasses being added to cement sand as additives, the amount of mold wall movement decreased. (4) Molding process being changed from ramming process to fluid sand mixture process, the amount of mold wall movement increased. (5) Mold wall movement in cement sand mold <b>mainly</b> <b>causes</b> <b>by</b> lowered strength resulted from dehydration or decomposition of cement hydrates...|$|R
