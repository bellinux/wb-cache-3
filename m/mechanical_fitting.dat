40|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>fitting</b> and {{relatively}} simple and safe method of installing {{it on the}} metal case of a battery have been devised {{to provide access to}} the interior of the battery to perform inspection and/or to measure such internal conditions as temperature and pressure. A metal boss or stud having an exterior thread is attached to the case by capacitor-discharge stud welding (CDSW), which takes only 3 to 6 milliseconds and in which the metallurgical bond (weld) and the heat-affected zone are limited to a depth of a few thousandths of an inch (a few hundredths of a millimeter). These characteristics of CDSW prevent distortion of the case and localized internal heating that could damage the chemical components inside of the battery. An access hole is then drilled through the stud and case, into the interior of the battery. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>fitting</b> having a matching thread is installed on the stud and the interior end of the fitting is sealed with a pressure-sealing washer/gasket.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{reviews the}} {{principles}} that rule the organization of motor commands that have been described {{over the past five}} decades in crayfish. The adaptation of motor behaviors requires the integration of sensory cues into the motor command. The respective roles of central neural networks and sensory feedback are presented in the order of increasing complexity. The simplest circuits described are those involved in the control of a single joint during posture (negative feedback-resistance reflex) and movement (modulation of sensory feedback and reversal of the reflex into an assistance reflex). More complex integration is required to solve problems of coordination of joint movements in a pluri-segmental appendage, and coordination of different limbs and different motor systems. In addition, beyond the question of <b>mechanical</b> <b>fitting,</b> the motor command must be appropriate to the behavioral context. Therefore, sensory information is used also to select adequate motor programs. A last aspect of adaptability concerns the possibility of neural networks to change their properties either temporarily (such on-line modulation exerted, for example, by presynaptic mechanisms) or more permanently (such as plastic changes that modify the synaptic efficacy). Finally, the question of how "automatic" local component networks are controlled by descending pathways, in order to achieve behaviors, is discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, intra-operative bone machining {{and assembly}} of osseous fragments {{are two very}} important research areas. One {{of the most challenging}} applications is the treatment of malignant osseous tumors within the pelvis due to its complex tri-dimensional geometry. The conventional surgical procedure includes tumoral resection (cutting of the osseous tumor) and reconstruction by allograft (assembly of fragments). Accuracy of bone cutting and osseous assembly has not yet been documented. This paper presents an experimental study on plastic bones, with experienced surgeons working under ideal conditions. The goal was to assess the accuracy by using geometrical parameters resulting from the surgical usual language: surgical margin for tumor cuttings, and maximal gap, gap volume and mean gap between the 2 osseous fragments. Both mean values and correlation between assembly parameters were relatively poor. Experienced surgeons did not manage to consistently perform accurate cuttings and osseous assemblies, even under ideal working conditions. The complex tri-dimensional architecture of the pelvis can mainly explain this inaccuracy. There is a need to adapt computer and robotic assisted technologies for tumor cuttings and osseous assemblies. Finally, our attempt to evaluate accuracy using simple geometrical parameters, was not satisfactory. There is a need to define new evaluation standards for these assemblies.

Maximum tolerances may be imposed on the deviations of the total charge, dipole moment and quadrupole computed by the site charge model from the corresponding quantum <b>mechanical</b> values. The <b>fitting</b> is achieved via the solution of a nonlinear least squares problem that incorporates specified upper bounds on the statistical error of the charge magnitudes; this automatically excludes satellite charge positions that lead to ill-conditioned and inaccurate charge estimates.

METHODS: We tested different inverted aortic prostheses with a prosthesis-annulus relationship in the mitral chamber of the Sheffield pulse duplicator (Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK), analyzed by comparing the prosthetic housing diameter and the predicted annulus diameter based on body surface area (0. 8 and 1 m(2) corresponding to an annulus diameter of 18. 8 - 20. 2 mm). The On-X 19 (On-X Life Technologies, Inc, Austin, Tex), SJM Regent 19 (St Jude Medical Inc, St Paul, Minn), Sorin Overline 18 (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy), and Medtronic Advantage Supra 19 (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) valves with a housing diameter of 19 to 20 mm were hydrodynamically compared. The tests were carried out at increasing pulse rate of 72, 80, 100, and 120 beats/min for a stroke volume of 20 and 30 mL. Therefore, cardiac output ranged from 1. 44 to 3. 6 L/min. RESULTS: Regardless of the pulse rate and stroke volume, the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve showed the highest mean diastolic pressure difference at each cardiac output (P <. 05). The mean gradients were significantly lower for the Sorin Overline valve regardless of the cardiac output, stroke volume, and pulse rate (P <. 05). The effective orifice areas observed followed exactly the same behavior: the lowest for the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve and the highest for the Sorin Overline valve. The Sorin Overline valve showed the highest closure volumes (P <. 05), and the On-X prosthesis showed the highest leakage volumes (P <. 05). The Sorin Overline valve had the highest total regurgitant volume (P <. 05), and the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve had the lowest total regurgitant volume (P <. 05).

40|$|Internal {{fixation}} {{techniques are}} in common used to stabilize vertebral fractures and correct severe scoliosis. Consolidation of injured vertebrae with neighbouring intact vertebra {{is the goal}} in the former case whilst fusion of the vertebrae in a corrected position is aimed at in the latter case. Degenerative spine diseases are not considered in this paper. Classical instrumentation consists of rods (e. g., Cotrel-Dubousset, Harrington, Luque-Galveston) attached to the bone by means of hooks or wires. More recently, transpedicular screws are introduced as an alternative bone/implant interface. Comparing the results of several studies, the posterior pedicle screw based devices demonstrate the ability to produce the most rigid constructs. However, the insertion of pedicle screws implicates a relatively high complication risk and its success strongly depends {{on the experience of}} the surgeon. Incorrect drilled holes or malplacement of the screws can result in nerve root injuries and fracture of the pedicle. Studies reported complication ratios up to 30 % with substantial neurological implications. A certain degree of automation of the critical actions may be necessary to enhance the safety of pedicle screw insertion. Two techniques of computer assisted spine surgery are compared. Both techniques permit a computer assisted surgical planning based on CT images. During operation the first system permanently observes the position of the drill relative to the spine and informs the surgeon on the deviation of the actual drill path to the planned drill path.

40|$|Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Imaging (USI) is {{a growing}} field in literature. It has been {{proven to be a}} useful tool for {{investigating}} the properties of the muscle. There is growing interest in ultrasound imaging techniques for the description of skeletal muscle function, and different algorithms have been developed for this purpose. The majority of studies limit their focus on a particular area of the muscle, such as the aponeuroses, or on architectural parameters such as fiber length and pennation angle. The investigation of the entire muscle visualised on the ultrasound image may help elucidate the muscle function under normal conditions or when external factors compromise or alter the muscle function. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a technique based on the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscles and facilitate their contraction. It is commonly used for strength training or in rehabilitation to accelerate or enhance the recovery of skeletal muscle's function. The ability of this technique to improve muscle performance in both healthy and diseased muscles has been demonstrated in research and in clinical practice. However the artificial nature of the muscle activation during FES leads to some important differences from the voluntary muscle contraction. Ultrasound Imaging (USI) is a potential tool that could provide objective measurements of the muscle's response during electrical stimulation, thus helping to describe and understand these differences. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop techniques based on USI that helps to elucidate the muscle function during electrical stimulation and allow comparison with voluntary contractions. Ultrasound videos were collected from healthy participants during experimental procedures involving voluntary and electrically induced muscle contractions. The videos were analysed using software algorithms for the tracking of features in US images. The resulting parameters were used as the basis for characterisation methods to describe the muscle contraction, both globally and locally. The effectiveness of the USI analysis techniques was tested and methods for extraction of physiological information from the video analysis were implemented. The regional distribution of muscle displacement during the tasks was analysed. Larger displacements were observed at deeper portions of the muscle in both the voluntary and the electrically induced contractions. Differential displacements across muscle depths were observed to differ during voluntary and FES contractions. The electric currents applied induce a uniform muscle contraction across different depths, most likely influenced by the way the electric field recruits muscle fibers. Muscle displacement was correlated to the force exerted by the muscle. Areas close to the deep aponeurosis have higher correlation with torque exerted and a second order polynomial can be used to define the relationship between displacement and torque. The relationship between the whole muscle displacement at different depths and the torque exerted was described using a polynomial surface <b>fitting.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> strain was used to map the muscle activation. Middle areas of the muscle undergo higher positive vertical strain (i. e. the muscle thickens) while deeper portions of the muscle are the most affected by shortening horizontal strain (i. e. the muscle shortens) in both voluntary and FES contractions. The muscle contractility was analysed through strain rate. A time-frequency analysis of the strain rate was performed. More frequency components and higher bandwidths were observed in FES induced contractions when compared to the voluntary. The frequency components might reflect the motor unit activation, suggesting that during FES all the motor units, firing at different rates, are recruited. In this project, USI was used as a tool to characterise the muscle behaviour locally. Regional muscle displacement and strain distribution have been used to elucidate the muscle function and quantify how different muscle areas are mechanically involved in the contraction. Strain rate was correlated with the muscle contractility and hypotheses regarding the correlation with motor units firing rate have been proposed. In conclusion a number of techniques were developed with the purpose to investigate the muscle function in normal conditions and when external factors, such as electrical stimulation, alter the natural muscle behaviour...|$|R
