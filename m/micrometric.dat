The peculiarity of the S5 micron is to be built on two separate shifting blocks that do not interfere between them allowing the two standards to get to touching. This characteristic make it possible to use extreme wide angle lenses and to perform adjustment movements otherwise impossible.

40|$|<b>Micrometric</b> lipid {{compartmentation}} at {{the plasma}} membrane is disputed. Using live confocal imaging, {{we found that}} three unrelated fluorescent sphingomyelin (SM) analogs spontaneously clustered at the outer leaflet into <b>micrometric</b> domains, contrasting with homogenous labelling by DiIC 18 and TMA-DPH. In erythrocytes, these domains were round, randomly distributed, and reversibly coalesced under hypotonicity. BODIPY-SM and -glucosylceramide showed distinct temperature-dependence, in the same ranking as Tm for corresponding natural lipids, indicating phase behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy excluded <b>micrometric</b> surface structural features. In CHO cells, similar surface <b>micrometric</b> patches were produced by either direct BODIPY-SM insertion or intracellular processing from BODIPY-ceramide, ruling out aggregation artefacts. BODIPY-SM surface <b>micrometric</b> patches were refractory to endocytosis block or actin depolymerization and clustered upon cholesterol deprivation, indicating self-clustering at the plasma membrane. BODIPY-SM excimers further suggested clustering in ordered domains. Segregation of BODIPY-SM and -lactosylceramide <b>micrometric</b> domains showed coexistence of distinct phases. Consistent with <b>micrometric</b> domain boundaries, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed restriction of BODIPY-SM lateral diffusion over long-range, but not short-range, contrasting with comparable high mobile fraction of BODPY-glucosylceramide in both ranges. Controlled perturbations of endogenous SM pool similarly affected BODIPY-SM domain size by confocal imaging and its mobile fraction by FRAP. The latter evidence supports the hypothesis that, as shown for BODIPY-SM, endogenous SM spontaneously clusters at the plasmalemma outer leaflet of living cells into ordered <b>micrometric</b> domains, defined in shape by liquid-phase coexistence and in size by membrane tension and cholesterol.

Effects on radiopacity, microhardness, pH and mineral induction in phosphate buffered saline and simulated body fluid were studied. It was revealed that the radiopaque nanometric bismuth-containing 45 S 5 bioactive glass reduced radiopacity of the root canal sealer less than a conventional <b>micrometric</b> counterpart. In addition, pH induction and calcium phosphate precipitation were quicker with the nanometric compared to the <b>micrometric</b> material, whilst the <b>micrometric</b> glass displayed a higher alkaline capacity.

40|$|<b>Micrometric</b> {{membrane}} lipid segregation is controversial. We addressed {{this issue in}} attached erythrocytes and found that fluorescent boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) analogs of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) [glucosylceramide (BODIPY-GlcCer) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM 1 BODIPY) ], sphingomyelin (BODIPY-SM), and phosphatidylcholine (BODIPY-PC inserted into the plasma membrane spontaneously gathered into distinct submicrometric domains. GM 1 BODIPY domains colocalized with endogenous GM 1 labeled by cholera toxin. All BODIPY-lipid domains disappeared upon erythrocyte stretching, indicating control by membrane tension. Minor cholesterol depletion suppressed BODIPY-SM and BODIPY-PC but preserved BODIPY-GlcCer domains. Each type of domain exchanged constituents but assumed fixed positions, suggesting self-clustering and anchorage to spectrin. Domains showed differential association with 4. 1 R versus ankyrin complexes upon antibody patching. BODIPY-lipid domains also responded differentially to uncoupling at 4. 1 R complexes [protein kinase C (PKC) activation] and ankyrin complexes (in spherocytosis, a membrane fragility disease).
