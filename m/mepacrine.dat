In his book, Defeat into Victory, he tells of the malaria rates among his units being 70%, largely due to noncompliance by his soldiers with the foul-tasting <b>mepacrine</b> they refused to take. Slim did not blame his medics for this problem, but placed the responsibility on his officers. [...] "Good doctors are no use without good discipline. More than half the battle against disease is fought not by the doctors, but by the regimental officers". After Slim dismissed a few officers for high unit malaria rates, the others realised he was serious and malaria treatment was enforced, dropping the rate to less than five percent. The combat effectiveness of his army was thus greatly enhanced. This physical and mental turnaround in the army under him was a contributing factor to the eventual defeat of the Japanese in Burma.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mepacrine</b> {{has been}} shown to bind to the prion protein and prevent the {{formation}} of prion aggregates in vitro,and full clinical trials of its use as a treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are under way in the United Kingdom and the United States. Small trials in Japan have reported improvement in the condition of patients with the disease,although other reports have shown no significant effect,and treatment of scrapie in mice and sheep has also shown no effect. Possible reasons for the lack of an in vivo effect include inefficient penetration of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the existence of drug-resistant prion proteins that increase in number when selected for by treatment with <b>mepacrine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many peer {{reviewed}} {{studies suggest that}} <b>mepacrine</b> sterilization (QS) is potentially safer than surgical sterilization. Nevertheless, in 1998 the Supreme Court of India banned the import or use of the drug, allegedly based on reports that it could cause cancer or ectopic pregnancies.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} various inhibitors {{are not always}} {{consistent}} for thrombin and cerastocytin. Just as with thrombin, cerastocytin-activated platelet aggregation is inhibited by chlorpromazine, theophylline and <b>mepacrine.</b> However, neither hirudin, nor antithrombin III {{have any effect on}} cerastocytin-mediated clot formation even though both have been observed to inhibit thrombin-facilitated platelet clot formation. This data suggests that cerastocytin has distinct sites for platelet and fibrinopeptide binding because the two functions could be inhibited independently of each other. Additionally, some antibodies (such as LJIblO) that have been observed to inhibit thrombin, interfered with cerastocytin activity, but not with cerastotin. This data reinforces the concept that there a multiple toxins that are capable of producing similar physiological results via very different activation mechanisms.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{work in the}} {{development}} of liquid-lquid separation techniques was undertaken by Cornish et al. with a process called [...] "systematic fractional distribution" [...] as well as Randall and Longtin, however, the central figure is certainly Lyman C. Craig. Lyman Craig's development of countercurrent distribution began with studying the distribution of a pharmaceutical, <b>mepacrine</b> (atabrine), between the two layers of an ethylene dichloride, methanol, and aqueous buffer biphasic solvent system. The distribution coefficient (Kc which coincides with partition coefficient) of atabrine varied by the composition of the solvent system and the pH of the buffer. In the next article, Craig was inspired by the work of Martin and Synge with partition chromatography to develop an apparatus that would separate compounds based on their distribution constant (K which coincides with partition coefficient). It was shown that a solvent system composed of benzene, n-hexane, methanol and water would separate mixtures of organic acids. It is remarkable that the mathematical theory developed hand-in-hand with the progression of applications. Craig continued to pursue this method of separation by testing different compounds, formulating biphasic solvent systems, and most importantly developing a commercially viable instrument.|$|E
40|$|The {{phospholipase}} inhibitor <b>mepacrine</b> {{has been}} shown to delay cell death of metabolically inhibited cultured cardiomyocytes. The present study was initiated to determine if <b>mepacrine</b> also delays cell death and development of osmotic fragility of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic adult rat cardiomyocytes. Isolated myocyte suspensions were incubated with 3 mmol/l (millimolar) iodoacetic acid and 6 mmol/l amytal (inhibited) or were pelleted into a slurry and layered with oil (ischemic) in the presence and absence of 10 or 50 mumol/l (micromolar) <b>mepacrine.</b> Rates of contracture, cell viability as determined by trypan blue permeability, cell viability after osmotic swelling in 170 mOsm media (osmotic fragility), and cell morphology were monitored. <b>Mepacrine</b> had no effects on rates of contracture, but was found to significantly delay cell death during isotonic incubations of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic cells. In contrast, <b>mepacrine</b> had no effect on the development of osmotic fragility. Incubation of metabolically inhibited myocytes in calcium-free media did not delay contracture or cell injury, but did attenuate the protective effects of <b>mepacrine.</b> This study confirms previous reports that <b>mepacrine</b> protects cells from injury, extends the observations of protection to ischemic isolated adult myocytes, but shows that development of osmotic fragility is not inhibited by <b>mepacrine...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mepacrine</b> is an {{antiproliferative}} agent, characterised by an {{aliphatic chain}} {{similar to that}} of natural polyamines whose activation is closely associated with cell proliferation and may lead to malignant transformation and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to investigate a possible antagonism between <b>mepacrine</b> and polyamines in tumour proliferation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF- 7 and Vero cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium and then subjected to graded concentrations of putrescine, spermine and spermidine alone and in combination with <b>mepacrine.</b> Methyl thiazole tetrazolium test and Western-blotting were performed. RESULTS: Putrescine and spermidine at 0. 5 mg/l significantly stimulated cell growth, whereas <b>mepacrine</b> treatment confirmed the enhanced p 21 expression previously reported by a recent study and growth inhibition. When used in combination, <b>mepacrine</b> antagonized MCF- 7 growth induced by polyamines. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that <b>mepacrine</b> may represent a choice in the treatment of tumours induced by the modified concentration of polyamines...|$|E
40|$|A problem {{strictly}} {{related to}} the spreading of malaria, is immunocompromission whichmakes patients more vulnerable to bacterial and viral infections and to other illness suchas tumour. We recently demonstrated that some antimalarials can modify the growth ofnormal and tumoural cells (1). <b>Mepacrine,</b> {{was found to be}} a potent inhibitor of VERO andMCF- 7 cell growth. Like chloropromazine, a drug used in the treatment of prion disease,mepacrine possesses an aliphatic chain very similar to that of putrescine, a naturalpolyamine whose concentration in biological tissues is crucial for cells, but in particular forprions proliferation. Aim of our study was to investigate if <b>mepacrine</b> could antagonize theproliferative effect of putrescine. VERO and MCF- 7 cells were cultured in MEM medium andtreated with increasing concentrations of putrescine, <b>mepacrine</b> and their association. MTT test was performed. Results show that putrescine significantly stimulated the growthof VERO and MCF- 7 cells, whereas <b>mepacrine</b> confirmed to be a potent inhibitor. Whenused in association, sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>mepacrine</b> antagonized the proliferativeeffect of putrescine on both cell cultures (inhibition > 60 %). The presence of thealiphatic chain in <b>mepacrine,</b> and putrescine, could explain this interaction. Finally, sinceit has been postulated by Prousiner (2) that the variation in the concentration ofpolyamines stimulates the proliferation of prions, {{on the basis of these}} preliminary data,we can assume that, similarly to chlorpromazine, <b>mepacrine</b> could be useful in thetreatment of prion diseases...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{treatment}} of recurrent pleural effusion in advanced malignant disease should be efficient and with tolerable side effects. Since 1983 intrathoracic instillation of the anti-malaria drug <b>mepacrine</b> {{has been used}} to achieve pleurodesis. The cytotoxic drug bleomycin has been claimed to be equally effective and with fewer side effects. The present study was designed to compare these two agents. METHODS [...] Forty patients with carcinoma and pleural effusions refractory to repeated pleural aspirations over the previous 12 weeks were randomised to receive treatment with intrathoracic instillation of <b>mepacrine</b> or bleomycin. Fluid volumes before and after pleurodesis, drainage time, and side effects were registered and analysed, and the response to treatment was evaluated by clinical examination and chest radiography. RESULTS [...] The amount of fluid produced after treatment in the patients receiving <b>mepacrine</b> was lower than in those receiving bleomycin, and the duration of chest drainage was shorter. After 30 days 16 of 20 in the <b>mepacrine</b> group responded to treatment and 10 of 20 in the bleomycin group. Most patients died during the three months observation period. Moderate side effects occurred equally in both groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Chemical pleurodesis can reduce or stop pleural effusion in many patients, and in this study <b>mepacrine</b> appeared to be more efficient than bleomycin. A prospective study with a larger number of patients is now warranted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mepacrine</b> and p-bromophenacylbromide {{were both}} found to impair 3 H-inositol {{phosphate}} production {{in response to}} both nutrient and hormone-neurotransmitter stimuli in islets prelabelled with 3 H-inositol. Both drugs also inhibited net 45 Ca uptake in response to glucose or glibenclamide and considerably modified the patterns of 45 Ca and 86 Rb efflux from perifused islets under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions. In addition, the oxidation of [U- 14 C] glucose in islets was impaired by either <b>mepacrine</b> or p-bromophenacylbromide. These inhibitory effects {{were found to be}} concentration-related for both <b>mepacrine</b> (0. 01 - 1. 0 mM) and p-bromophenacylbromide (0. 03 - 0. 3 mM) and were accompanied, in general, by a similar degree of inhibition of insulin secretion. These results suggest that both <b>mepacrine</b> and p-bromophenacylbromide can inhibit phospholipase C activity in intact islets, but also impair 45 Ca and 86 Rb fluxes and oxidation of nutrients. The diversity of these drugs' inhibitory actions makes them unsuitable tools for examining the role of specific cellular processes in the regulation of islet function.

40|$|Indomethacin (1 microM) {{enhanced}} histamine-induced contractions in pig and guinea-pig isolated tracheae. <b>Mepacrine</b> (30 - 50 microM) abolished {{this effect}} of indomethacin suggesting that contractile metabolites of arachidonate {{are involved in}} the response to indomethacin. <b>Mepacrine</b> (100 microM) in the absence of indomethacin also markedly reduced histamine-induced contractions (81. 2 % inhibition) in the pig trachea, without affecting responses to acetylcholine. Histamine-induced responses in the guinea-pig trachea were similarly reduced, but with a higher concentration of <b>mepacrine</b> (300 microM). BW 755 c (226 microM) enhanced histamine-induced contractions in some pig tracheal preparations and caused inhibition in others. These effects of BW 755 c were negatively correlated to the initial reactivity of the muscle to histamine such that weak contractions were potentiated and strong contractions were inhibited. A similar effect was seen with phenidone (100 microM). The results with BW 755 c and phenidone suggest that muscle reactivity (to histamine) may be partly determined by the balance between the release of inhibitory and contractile arachidonate metabolites. <b>Mepacrine</b> exerts a different effect indicating that histamine-induced contractions are regulated by a mepacrine-sensitive process which appears to be separate from the metabolism of arachidonate...|$|E
40|$|Dense granule {{disorder}} {{is one of}} the most common platelet abnormalities, resulting from dense granule deficiency or secretion defect. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the flow cytometric combination of <b>mepacrine</b> uptake/release assay and CD 63 expression detection in the management of patients with suspected dense granule disorder. Over a period of 5 years, patients with abnormal platelet aggregation and/or reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion suggestive of dense granule disorder were consecutively enrolled. The flow cytometric assays were systematically performed to further investigate dense granule functionality. Among the 26 included patients, 18 cases showed impaired <b>mepacrine</b> uptake/release and reduced CD 63 expression on activated platelets, consistent with δ-storage pool deficiency (SPD). Another seven patients showed decrease in <b>mepacrine</b> release and CD 63 expression but <b>mepacrine</b> uptake was normal, indicating secretion defect rather than δ-SPD. Unfortunately, ATP secretion could not be measured in 7 out of the 26 patients due to insufficient sample and/or severe thrombocytopenia. This test combination provides a rapid and effective method to detect the heterogeneous abnormalities of platelet dense granule by distinguishing between storage and release defects. This combination is particularly advantageous for severely thrombocytopenic patients and pediatric patients in which only minimal sample is required...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} platelet dense (δ) granule defects are easy bruising, {{as well as}} epistaxis and bleeding after delivery, tooth extractions and surgical procedures. The observed symptoms may be explained either by a decreased number of granules or by a defect in the uptake/release of granule contents. We have developed a method to study platelet dense granule storage and release. The uptake of the fluorescent marker, <b>mepacrine,</b> into the platelet dense granule was measured using flow cytometry. The platelet population was identified by the size and binding of a phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody against GPIb. Cells within the discrimination frame were analysed for green (<b>mepacrine)</b> fluorescence. Both resting platelets and platelets previously stimulated with collagen and the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN was analysed for <b>mepacrine</b> uptake. By subtracting the value for <b>mepacrine</b> uptake after stimulation from the value for uptake without stimulation for each individual, the platelet dense granule release capacity could be estimated. Whole blood samples from 22 healthy individuals were analysed. <b>Mepacrine</b> incubation without previous stimulation gave mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of 83 ± 6 (mean ± 1 SD, range 69 – 91). The difference in MFI between resting and stimulated platelets was 28 ± 7 (range 17 – 40). Six members of a family, of whom one had a known δ-storage pool disease, were analysed. The two members (mother and son) who had prolonged bleeding times also had MFI values disparate from the normal population in this analysis. The values of one daughter with mild bleeding problems but a normal bleeding time were in {{the lower part of}} the reference interval...|$|E
40|$|In intact rat {{pancreatic}} acini, the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor <b>mepacrine</b> did {{not affect}} basal amylase release but dose-dependently inhibited the carbachol (IC 50 65 microM) and CCK- 8 (IC 50 210 microM) -stimulated amylase release. In permeabilized acini, <b>mepacrine</b> shifted the dose-response curve for calcium to the right by a factor 2 and inhibited the release of amylase stimulated by GTPrS. From these results we conclude that carbachol, CCK- 8 and GTPrS probably activate a phospholipase A 2 closely coupled to exocytosis. In VitroJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Pyronaridine, an acndine derivative, {{has been}} found {{effective}} in China {{for the treatment of}} drug-resistant falciparum malaria. The activities of pyronaridine and <b>mepacrine</b> were compared with those of standard antimalarial drugs in vitro against chloroquine-sensitive (CS) and chloroquine-resistant (CR) Plasmodium falciparum isolates to investigate cross resistance. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC») against the resistant isolates were 2. 8 -fold higher than the sensitive isolates for pyronaridine (CS = 7. 3 nM; CR = 20. 5 nM) and 3. 2 -fold higher for <b>mepacrine</b> (CS = 13. 3 nM; CR = 42. 6 nM).
