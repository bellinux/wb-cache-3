40|$|The {{theory of}} an Aston-type mass-spectrometer using a {{cylindrical}} condenser and bringing all ions {{of the same}} specific mass to a point focus by variation of the magnetic field alone is developed. The theory of the motion of an ion in an inverse first-power electrostatic field is studied under the particular set of conditions where all ions regardless of their energy enter the condenser normal to its leading edge and at the median position in the gap. Taylor series expressions have been obtained which give the exit position, {{the square of the}} exit velocity, and the tangent of the angle of deflection in the field. The existence, uniqueness, continuity, and uniform convergence of these series solutions are established. The equation of the family of straight lines which the ions follow beyond the electrostatic field and before the magnetic field are obtained. The existence, location, and width of a virtual source are established for this system under the above conditions of collimation.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} pole tip recession (PTR) in laminated magnetic recording heads (also known as "sandwich heads"). These heads provide a platform for the utilisation of advanced soft magnetic thin films in practical recording heads suitable for high frequency helical scan tape recording systems. PTR results from a differential wear of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> from the tape-bearing surface of the head. It results in a spacing loss of the playback or read signal of 54. 6 dB per recording wavelength separation of the poles from the tape. PTR depends on the material combination used in the head, on the tape type and the climate - temperature and relative humidity (r. h.). Five head materials were studied: two non-magnetic substrate materials- sintered multi granular CaTi 03 and composite CaTi 03 /ZrTi 04 /Ti 02 and three soft magnetic materials- amorphous CoNbZr, and nanocrystalline FeNbSiN and FeTaN. Single material dummy heads were constructed and their wear rates measured when cycling them in a Hi- 8 camcorder against commercially available metal particulate (MP) and metal evaporated (ME) tapes in three different climates: 25 °C/ 20 %r. h., 25 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used to examine}} changes the head surface chemistry. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine changes in head and tape surface topography. PTR versus cycling time of laminated heads of CaTi 03 /ZrTiO 4 /Ti 02 and FeTaN construction was measured using AFM. The principal wear mechanism observed for all head materials was microabrasion caused by the mating body - the tape surface. The variation in wear rate with climate and tape type was due to a variation in severity in this mechanism, except for tape cycling at 40 °C in which gross damage was observed to be occurring to the head surface. Two subsidiary wear mechanisms were found: third body scratching (all materials) and grain pullout (both ceramics and FeNbSiN). No chemical wear was observed, though tribochemical reactions were observed on the metal head surfaces. PTR was found to be caused by two mechanisms - the first differential microabrasion of the metal and substrate materials and which was characterised by a low (~ 10 nm) equilibrium value. The second was by deep ploughing by third body debris particles, thought mainly to be grain pullout particles. This level of PTR caused by this mechanism was often more severe, and of a non-equilibrium nature. It was observed more for ME tape, especially at 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 25 °c/ 20 %r. h. Two other phenomena on the laminated head <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> were observed and commented upon: staining and ripple texturing...|$|R

Scaling to low power while holding the main dimensionless parameters constant requires a decrease in the thruster channel size and an increase in the magnetic field strength. Increasing the magnetic field becomes technically challenging since the field can saturate the miniaturized inner components of the magnetic circuit and scaling down the magnetic circuit leaves very little room for <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> and heat shields. An alternative approach is to employ a cylindrical Hall thruster (CHT) geometry. Laboratory model CHTs have operated at power levels ranging from the order of 50 Watts up to 1 kW.

Compared to the annular Hall thruster, the CHT has a lower insulator surface area to discharge chamber volume ratio. Consequently, there is the potential for reduced wall losses in the channel of a CHT, and any reduction in wall losses should translate into lower channel heating rates and reduced erosion.

40|$|Modern {{applications}} in industry, navigation and medicine demand small and sensitive magnetic field sensors. In this thesis {{we have developed}} a new planar micro fluxgate magnetometer. High resolution, low power consumption and orthogonal fields detection makes it suitable for portable compass applications. The developed sensor is a fully integrated device based on CMOS process that provides driving and readout electronics, plus the metallization layers for the excitation and pickup coils. A soft amorphous ferromagnetic material is bonded and structured, using an additional, postprocess implemented on a whole 6 inch wafer to form sensor core {{on the surface of}} the chip. The single core principle was selected with the intention to elongate the core, reduce the power consumption and increase sensitivity. We employed a new extraction method, based on the detection of mean value of the induced voltage peaks in the pickup coil, which carry the information on the external field. Several models and tools for the optimization of the core geometry, excitation, as well as pickup coils have been developed. For the first time, the effect of perming has been investigated. Perming is manifested as a change in sensor offset after the magnetic shock. A model was developed, which uses equivalent <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> to account for the contribution of the "frozen" domains not affected by the excitation. Model shows that the effect is predominantly dependent on the level of the core saturation. The electronics has been integrated in a conventional 1 µm CMOS process. Apart from the excitation, a single electronic circuit is used for both axes in order to decrease the power consumption, reduce the chip size, and obtain better matching. The signal extraction principle is accomplished using a box-car circuit. To reduce the influence of the 1 /f noise of the amplifiers, we implemented a modulation technique, using an additional modulator. Modulated signal is amplified and finally demodulated using the correlated double sampling demodulator. We have implemented a new digital feedback, for the first time applied on the excitation coils. It consists of comparator, 8 -bit U/D counter and current sources to create magnetic field for contra action. The output of the counter represents the digital information on the external field and is transmitted using I 2 C communication block integrated on chip. The fabricated sensor works from a single 2. 5 V power supply and consumes 8. 5 mW in open loop mode and 10 mW with a feedback. With the excitation at 350 kHz, the magnetometer exhibits the sensitivity of 2950 V/T and 8 kHz bandwidth. Equivalent noise spectral density at 1 Hz is equal to 12 nT/√Hz. When used as a compass, the sensor has the angular error of ± 1 ° without and ± 3 ° using feedback. Measured perming is equal to 1. 4 µT, after the shock of 200 mT. Performance of the developed micro-fluxgate is better in terms of noise, angular error, perming, operational voltage, as well as power consumption, than any other fully integrated micro fluxgate presented up to date. In addition, the fabrication is based on the batch and low cost CMOS technology and compatible post-process so we can expect commercialisation in the near future...|$|E
