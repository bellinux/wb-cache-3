40|$|Legal {{restrictions}} on debt limit and <b>municipal</b> <b>taxing</b> <b>authority</b> are almost universal in the United States. These restrictions {{have contributed to}} an inability {{on the part of}} many cities to provide basic support for the additional growth and development of urban areas. In most instances, political considerations have prevented state legislatures from lifting these financial limitations. In order to sustain urban growth and support the development of new urban areas, several states have developed alternatives to continued reliance on existing municipal governments. I submit that the most satisfactory alternative is the use of special district governments to finance {{all or part of the}} required utility and community support facilities. The particular variety of special district developed in Texas for this purpose has produced a record of successful and basically satisfactory operations unmatched in other parts of the nation. Therefore, particular attention is accorded the functioning of Texas water districts. The thesis of this paper is that increased reliance on the use of special districts, patterned after the Texas variety, offers a valuable, flexible and appropriate instrument for effectuation of plans for urban growth whether as extensions of existing growth areas or as new communities...|$|R

There were no exemptions for churchmen or aristocrats. The Republic had sufficient authority to have these burdens accepted by its citizens, {{but this was a}} function of the [...] "bottom-up" [...] implementation of the <b>taxes.</b> <b>Municipal</b> and provincial <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> possessed more legitimacy than central authorities, and this legitimacy was reinforced {{by the fact that the}} broad tax base enabled local <b>authorities</b> to tailor <b>taxes</b> to local circumstances.

40|$|The United States {{commodity}} {{tax system}} is fiscally decentralized: state, county, and <b>municipal</b> governments have <b>taxing</b> <b>authority.</b> Geographic borders create “lines,”' which are demarcations of goods into different tax rate categories; tax rates change discontinuously at lines. A discontinuous change in tax liabilities is a “notch”' {{and results in}} deadweight loss from cross-border shopping and tax driven product innovation. This dissertation studies the consequences of lines and notches on tax competition and utilizes variation in local taxes to understand tax policy. The dissertation focuses on sales taxation, but the theories and empirical methodologies are informative for tax policy more generally and are applicable to issues of preferential taxation, optimal line drawing, and time and characteristic notches. Chapter II extends the standard model of sales tax competition to allow for tax rates to vary not only across states, but within states. I demonstrate that <b>municipal</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are lower in level terms on the high-tax side of a state border relative to <b>municipal</b> sales <b>taxes</b> on the low-tax side of a border. Using a new methodology for studying municipal responses to discontinuities, I show that <b>municipal</b> <b>taxes</b> are a function of distance to the nearest state border. After accounting for differences in tax rates within a state, discontinuous tax changes at borders become smaller. Chapter III answers whether geographic differentiation of tax rates is optimal from a state government's perspective. I demonstrate that under relatively weak assumptions, differentiation of tax rates is almost always optimal. Replacing a large distortion with many smaller distortions everywhere is optimal from a social welfare perspective. Chapter IV studies how municipal governments react to county tax rates. Using an identification strategy grounded in a theoretical model, I identify strategic reaction functions. Jurisdictions mimic the tax rates of their neighbors. I also demonstrate [...] unlike state-federal reaction functions estimated in the literature [...] that a higher county tax rate implies strategically lower <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> rates. The results in this dissertation imply that fiscal federalism and both spatial location and spatial interaction {{must be considered in}} order to understand tax competition and optimal commodity taxation...|$|R
