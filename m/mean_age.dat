5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, 144 {{people lived}} in Rivington, 63 males and 81 females. There were 48 {{households}} of which 34 lived in detached houses and 14 in terraced or semi-detached properties.

40|$|Abstract — The {{death rates}} due to {{alcoholism}} in Japan were analysed {{for the period}} 1950 - 1978. The alcoholism death rates for both sexes increased each year. The alcoholism death rates were {{closely related to the}} levels of alcohol consumption. Among both sexes the lowest age-adjusted death rates were observed in married persons and the highest death rates in divorced persons. Geographical variations in the alcoholism death rates were analysed; they were also correlated with alcohol consumption levels. The <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> at death for alcoholics were 50 for men and 48 for women; the <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> remained constant during the period of study...|$|R

5|$|People aged between 25 and 44 {{represent}} {{the majority of}} Navenby residents, with 451 recorded in 2001. This is closely followed by people aged 45–64 (442) and children aged 5–15 (221). Children aged under 4 (69) and people aged 16–24 (115) are in the minority. Almost 200people (190) {{over the age of}} 75 were living in Navenby in 2001. The <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of Navenby's population is 43.5 and the median age is 43.5. In 1851, 136babies in every 1,000 died in their first year.

25|$|The median and <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of {{automobiles}} has steadily increased since 1969. In 2007, the overall median age for automobiles was 9.4 years, {{a significant increase}} over 1990 when {{the median age of}} vehicles in operation in the US was 6.5 years and 1969 when the <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> for automobiles was 5.1 years.

As SUVs are part of a relatively new consumer trend originating mostly in the 1990s, SUVs had the lowest <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of any body style in the US (6.1 years).

The result of the study clearly showed that people who consumed L. bulgaricus daily had 2.6 times lower incidence of catching a cold. The study concluded that the consumption of yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus augmented natural killer cell activity and reduced the risk of catching the common cold in elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson–Gilford {{progeria}} {{syndrome is}} an extremely rare developmental autosomal dominant condition, characterized by premature and accelerated aging (~7 times the normal rate) beginning at childhood.

The <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of diagnosis is ~3 years and the <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of death is ~13 years.

25|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 Pickering had a {{population}} of 6,846 people in 3,071 households. There were 3,213 males and 3,633 females.

40|$|Telomere {{length is}} {{hypothesised}} to be a biological marker of both cognitive and physical ageing. Here we measure telomere length, and cognitive and physical abilities at <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> 70, 73 and 76 {{years in the}} Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC 1936), and at <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> 79, 87, 90 and 92 years in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC 1921). We investigate whether telomere length change predicts change in cognitive and physical abilities. In LBC 1936 telomere length decreased {{by an average of}} 65 base pairs per year and in LBC 1921 by 69 base pairs per year. However, change in telomere length did not predict change in cognitive or physical abilities. This study shows that, although cognitive ability, walking speed, lung function and grip strength all decline with age, they do so independently of telomere length shortening...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to identify factors related to history of hysterectomy; to evaluate whether or not subgroups with different rates of hysterectomy also report significantly different <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> at natural menopause; and to consider how variation in rates of hysterectomy may affect intrapopulation and cross-population comparisons of median ages at natural menopause. Data were drawn from a community sample in upstate New York. It is demonstrated that hysterectomy rates are not random with respect to variables that are also related to age at natural menopause. For example, women reporting high levels of education reported lower rates of hysterectomy and earlier <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> at menopause. In addition, median ages at menopause and rates of hysterectomy were examined by correlation and regression analysis across a selection of industrialized countries.
