5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> as soon as the lights came on he would rush home {{to see if he could}} duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the class of 1965, which also included Guy Chamberlain, Paddy Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Otto Graham, Sid Luckman, and Bob Waterfield. He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E

"Three {{principal}} causes exist why forestry {{is still}} so backward: first, the long time which wood needs for its development; second, the great variety of sites on which it grows; thirdly, {{the fact that the}} forester who practices <b>much</b> writes <b>but</b> little, and he who writes <b>much</b> practices <b>but</b> little." ...|$|R

25|$|Stiltsville may {{not have}} looked like <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> in the 1940s and 1950s, it was a popular place where lawyers, bankers, politicians, and other moneyed, well-connected Miamians came to drink, relax and kick back. Law {{enforcement}} periodically visited the area, looking for vice activities.|$|E
25|$|Florenz Ziegfeld {{wanted to}} display Sandow at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, but Ziegfeld knew that Maurice Grau had Sandow under a contract. Grau wanted $1,000 a week.

25|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, second-order arithmetic is {{a collection}} of axiomatic systems that formalize the natural numbers and their subsets. It is an alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation for <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> not all, of mathematics. It was introduced by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their book Grundlagen der Mathematik. The standard axiomatization of second-order arithmetic is denoted Z2.|$|E

25|$|Problem 1 – If the photon has a short wavelength, and therefore, a large momentum, the {{position}} {{can be measured}} accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long wavelength and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} a new problem arose. There was too much scrip and a {{shortage}} of babysitting. As new members joined, more scrip {{was added to the}} system until couples had too <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> new members were not able to spend it because no one else wanted to babysit. In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added too much scrip into the system via the amount issued to new members.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, most interstate {{transportation}} {{is done by}} road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbour States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> {{was accompanied by a}} significant increase of the toll fees. From São Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.|$|E

25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>but</b> {{not all of}} {{the area}} now suffers from high {{unemployment}} and parts of it are amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK. This is particularly true in parts of the metropolitan boroughs of Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. According to the Government's 2007 Index of Deprivation (ID 2007), Sandwell is the third most deprived authority in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, and the 14th most deprived of the UK's 354 districts. Wolverhampton is the fourth most deprived district in the West Midlands, and the 28th most deprived nationally. Walsall is the fifth most deprived district in the West Midlands region, and the 45th most deprived in the country.|$|E
25|$|Highly skilled leg spin bowlers {{are also}} able to bowl {{deliveries}} that behave unexpectedly, including the googly, which turns the opposite way to a normal leg break and the topspinner, which does not turn but dips sharply and bounces higher than other deliveries. A few leg spinners such as Abdul Qadir, Anil Kumble, Shane Warne and Mushtaq Ahmed have also mastered the flipper, a delivery that like a topspinner goes straight on landing, but floats through the air before skidding and keeping low, often dismissing batsmen leg before wicket or bowled. Another variation in the arsenal of some leg spinners is the slider, a leg break pushed out of the hand somewhat faster, {{so that it does}} not spin as <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> travels more straight on.|$|E
25|$|Hollandic {{is spoken}} in Holland and Utrecht, though the {{original}} forms of this dialect (which were {{heavily influenced by}} a West Frisian substratum and, from the 16th century on, by Brabantian dialects) are now relatively rare. The urban dialects of the Randstad, which are Hollandic dialects, do not diverge from standard Dutch very <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> {{there is a clear}} difference between the city dialects of Rotterdam, The Hague, Amsterdam and Utrecht. In some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used, especially north of Amsterdam. Another group of dialects based on Hollandic is that spoken in the cities and larger towns of Friesland, where it partially displaced West Frisian in the 16th century and is known as Stadsfries ("Urban Frisian").|$|E

50|$|Volleyball {{was perfect}} for naturism/nudism since most clubs were small and a volleyball court didn't require <b>much</b> space <b>but</b> {{involved}} many people. The game was also inclusive in that it supported varying levels of athleticism and did not require <b>much</b> equipment. <b>But</b> most importantly, it was ideal for nude play {{since there was no}} need for a team uniform or protective equipment.|$|R

25|$|<b>Much,</b> <b>but</b> not all, of the {{evidence}} used against the accused, was spectral evidence, or {{the testimony of the}} afflicted who claimed to see the apparition or the shape of the person who was allegedly afflicting them. The theological dispute that ensued about the use of this evidence was based on whether a person had to give permission to the Devil for his/her shape to be used to afflict. Opponents claimed that the Devil was able to use anyone's shape to afflict people, but the Court contended that the Devil could not use a person's shape without that person's permission; therefore, when the afflicted claimed to see the apparition of a specific person, that was accepted as evidence that the accused had been complicit with the Devil.|$|E
25|$|Fan {{stated that}} every game {{he worked on}} had only him {{designing}} the prototype, adding {{that he used to}} draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in Flash and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble South Park too <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Churchill {{published}} {{a collection of}} speeches with a foreword under the title Liberalism and the Social Problem. In it he argued for maintaining much {{of the social order}} and for gradualism in reform. He wanted to make the existing society work better and more humanely so as to preserve it better. Churchill, it was said, wanted a society where the upper class remained in control, distributing benefits to a grateful and industrious working class. He was then compared with Lloyd George who was seen as Churchill's mentor and from whom Churchill learned <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> who, unlike Churchill, wanted to change some of the fundamental structures of society. Churchill was one of very few Liberals who pressed for the expansion of the House of Lords whether or not the Parliament Act was passed.|$|E

25|$|The various Native American {{peoples who}} lived along its banks used the river European {{settlers}} would later name after Henry Hudson, {{the first of}} them to explore it, for commerce and trade. They {{were aware of the}} navigational hazards it offered their canoes, and built bonfires on the shores nearest tricky currents and hidden shallows. Colonists followed them as first sailing ships, then steamships, carried goods and passengers between New York City and the upper limit of navigable waters at Troy. Commerce sharply increased in the 1820s with the development of the Erie and Delaware and Hudson canals. The former connected the East Coast with the recently settled Midwest; the latter brought anthracite coal from Northeastern Pennsylvania to New York City. The development of the railroad in the mid-19th century took <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> not all, of this traffic, and river shipping continues today.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} damage {{to just one}} side of the MTL, there is {{opportunity}} for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex to remap when necessary. Remapping can occur in cases like the one above, and, with time, the patient can recover and become more skilled at remembering. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies– in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor– demonstrates this. This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were afflicted. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has not been investigated <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> imaging results show that it is likely.|$|E
25|$|Lake Charles hosts a family-friendly Mardi Gras celebration {{with nine}} parades. With over 50 krewes, it {{is second only}} to New Orleans in the number of krewes in Louisiana. The Lake Charles Mardi Gras celebration is unique in that it is the only place in Louisiana where the public is invited to see the costumes of the all the krewes in one place, at the Lake Charles Civic Center. Mardi Gras began in Lake Charles as early as 1882 when King Momus landed on the lakefront to begin the celebration. With the onset of the World Wars, Mardi Gras in Lake Charles was not celebrated as <b>much,</b> <b>but</b> was revived {{in the latter part of}} the century. This celebration begins in Lake Charles on January 6 each year. The last parade is the Krewe of Krewes Parade in {{downtown}} Lake Charles. Mardi Gras in Lake Charles regularly draws 150,000 people. In addition, Mardi Gras can be enjoyed in Lake Charles year round at the Mardi Gras Museum of Imperial Calcasieu, which features elaborate costumes and an interactive float. This museum houses the world's largest collection of Mardi Gras costumes.|$|E
