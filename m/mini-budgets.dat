50|$|The {{opposition}} parties criticized the <b>mini-budget</b> as the NDP leader Jack Layton {{mentioned that the}} budget did little for impoverished Canadians, and that big corporations such as oil companies and major banks will receive hefty tax breaks. The Liberals were critical of the GST cut as being not an efficient tax-relief but did praise the corporate tax cuts. The <b>mini-budget,</b> a confidence motion did pass 127-76 but without support of any opposition party as the Liberals abstained from voting {{as they did with}} the Fall 2007 Throne Speech.|$|R

5000|$|The Government {{postponed}} {{major policy}} adjustments, planning a <b>mini-Budget</b> for May. Hawke wrote to US President Reagan {{calling on the}} US to reduce its Budget deficit. The Business Council called for wage reductions, decreased government expenditure, a lower dollar and deregulation of the labour market. Seven months into the crisis, Hawke told the State Premiers that the [...] "savings of Australia must be freed" [...] to go into business investment for export expansion, and funding to the states was cut. A phase out of tariff protections was continued and company tax was cut by 10% to 39%. In the May <b>mini-Budget,</b> payment to the states was cut by $870 million and tax cuts deferred. The Government declared cost cutting was completed.|$|R

50|$|A {{slump in}} {{revenues}} {{associated with the}} recent global financial crisis compelled Rees and the State Treasurer Eric Roozendaal to implement a <b>mini-budget</b> which was handed down on 11 November 2008. The <b>mini-budget</b> increased taxes and charges such as land tax, mineral royalties, parking space levies and also announced the privatisation of state assets. A universal scheme providing free travel on public transport for all students going {{to and from school}} was curtailed - a decision since reversed - and the previously announced North West Metro and South West rail projects were indefinitely postponed. A series of by-elections to replace former Premier Morris Iemma, Deputy Premier John Watkins and Health Minister Reba Meagher resulted in massive swings against the government and saw John Watkins' former seat of Ryde resoundingly lost to the Liberals.|$|R
5000|$|While {{for most}} Australians the Menzies era was {{an era of}} prosperity, the nation {{experienced}} high inflation {{during the early years}} of Menzies' rule. The Korean War increased demand for commodities. Wool in particular boomed, leading to a rise in growers' incomes, but also to inflation. The Arbitration Court helped stabilise wages from 1953. From 1959-1960 Australia experienced something of a boom, spurred by overseas speculators and high domestic spending - resulting in recession by 1961, following a [...] "horror" [...] <b>mini-budget</b> designed to slow the economy. Unemployment reaching 2.1% (at that time considered [...] "high") and Menzies went on to win the 1961 election by just one seat.

50|$|The Rees {{government}} {{responded to}} the crisis with a three-point plan. Firstly, Rees reaffirmed his government's commitment to the retention of a Triple A credit rating. Rees emphasised that as finance and credit became harder {{to get around the}} world, retaining a Triple A credit rating was essential to being able to borrow money at the lowest rates available. Secondly, as Chair of the government's Budget sub-committee, Rees announced there would be a <b>mini-budget</b> which was delivered in November 2008. The <b>mini-budget</b> delayed a number of large scale capital works projects with long lead times and instead emphasised capital expenditure on smaller projects which could generate employment more quickly. Third, Rees drew industry and business leaders together to conduct a job summit. This summit was co-chaired by Roger Corbett, Steve Harkins and David Gonski. In addition to the Work Plan developed by the summit, Rees also announced the establishment of 4,000 government apprenticeships across the state and 2,000 cadetships.|$|R

50|$|Roozendaal was {{promoted}} to Treasurer by incoming Premier Nathan Rees, with immediate responsibilities for producing a 2008 <b>mini-budget</b> and maintaining the State's credit rating. In 2010, Roozendaal was accused of wasting taxpayers' money after he took two trips to New York {{at a cost of}} almost A$100,000. Roozendaal claimed the trips were designed to reinforce New South Wales' AAA credit rating through meetings with Moody's and Standard & Poor's, even though both companies had representatives in Australia that Roozendaal could have met with.|$|R
25|$|On October 30, 2007, the Conservatives tabled an {{economic}} statement (similar to a <b>mini-budget)</b> and announced various {{tax cuts and}} exemptions. Overall, the budget included a total of $60 billion in tax cuts over five years including $14 billion in corporate tax cuts by 2012 (or a drop of 33%), accelerated their promised further 1% drop of the GST (to 5%) and increased the basic personal tax exemption to $10,100 per year by 2009. The lowest personal tax rate was reduced from 15.5% to 15% retroactively effective 1 January 2007, reversing the rollback effected in the 2006 budget.|$|R

50|$|The chair {{malfunction}} occurred while Nene was {{answering questions}} concerning Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's <b>mini-budget</b> on the programme View from the House. On the video, the chair cracks audibly, causing Nene to wince, though he kept speaking. Twelve {{seconds after the}} cracking sound the chair failed catastrophically, causing Nene to fall backwards, his hands grabbing at the desk as the chair collapsed beneath him. Presenter Hayde Fitzpatrick managed to keep stone faced as the camera switched quickly to her. The program then went to a commercial break while the producers ascertained Nene's condition. He was unharmed and the interview continued, with Nene in a different chair.|$|R

50|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 <b>mini-budget,</b> the New South Wales Government {{declared}} 140 {{hectares of}} the school to be surplus to educational needs and the land will be sold in 2011. However, due to a strong public protest against this action, an inquiry was led into process of selling approximately seven eighths of the school. As a result, Mal Peters, the Inquiry Chair, recommended the school's agricultural sector to be upgraded in order to reflect current industry practice and standards due to it being an economic, wise and important public investment {{for the people of}} NSW as it supplies young scientists with the knowledge for the ever declining, but demanding agricultural sector of the world.|$|R
25|$|Carlingford {{railway station}} is the {{terminus}} of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 {{as a private}} railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, is a mostly single-track line. There is currently only one service {{in the early morning}} which connects to the city directly, at other times a train-change at Clyde, is necessary to reach other stations, and consequently the service has a low patronage, though it is quite popular during peak hours. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised to the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day to become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 <b>mini-budget.</b>|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{the line-item}} budget, which lists total {{departmental}} appropriations by items for which will spend funds, a program budget displays {{a series of}} “mini-budgets,” which show the cost {{of each of the}} activities that departments perform. In the case of the water department, for example, a separate <b>mini-budget</b> would be established for water production and distribution, water system repair and maintenance and meter reading. Program budgeting enables to identify the total cost of each service and set spending levels and priorities accordingly. The downside to the program budget approach is that considerable time is required to establish and maintain the system. Also, programs tend to overlap, both between departments and within the same departments, which can make the collecting data difficult. </p...|$|R

The stated goal of the corporate tax cuts was to set Canadian corporate tax rates as {{the lowest in the}} G7, although this would require the provinces do matching tax cuts. The lowest personal tax rate will be reduced from 15.5% to 15%, effective January 1, 2007 back to the same level as when the Conservatives were elected in 2006. Economists said that with the large surpluses the federal government accumulated as well as high tax levels, there was another room for significant tax cuts.|$|R
40|$|For tax-weary voters, a {{surprising}} {{contrast between the}} 2006 and 2004 elections has been the political acceptance of cutting taxes. In 2004, the debate was whether {{to spend money on}} health care or reduce taxes, with only the Conservatives proposing meaningful tax relief. In this election, the major parties have proposed a variety of cuts to taxes. If anything, this election proves that tax cuts can be popular. However, from a long-term perspective, a key issue is whether the tax relief will substantially improve Canada’s competitiveness by encouraging work and investment. None of the tax proposals in this election are brave policies that would lead to fundamental tax reform. The analysis below suggests that the broad-based income and sales tax cuts being discussed will offer minor improvements to Canada’s competitive advantage in the next five years.

40|$|The November 14 <b>mini-budget</b> gave Canadians {{some new}} dollars-and-cents {{calculations}} {{to weigh in}} judging {{whether they want to}} vote in the snow. But they should not overlook another risk that has been hanging over this minority government — the possibility of a huge and costly mistake in pension policy. Pension policy in Canada needs a fresh look. Canada’s defined-benefit pensions are in trouble: many are underfunded and exposed to the financial stresses of their sponsors. But some proposed fixes could make matters worse. NDP leader Jack Layton has talked in recent months about pension protection as a condition for keeping the Liberals in power. While {{we do not know what}} he has in mind, a federal pension-benefit guarantee agency — a deeper-pocketed version of Ontario’s Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund — is an obvious option. Such an agency, like counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom, would backstop pension plans when sponsors went bankrupt. The agency would levy premiums on the plans it covered, and pay all or part of their benefits if a sponsor failed...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the overall number of}} people, {{engaging}} in tourist activity, in Australia and in NSW, has declined. While the number of inbound tourists has slightly increased, the number of Australians, locally participating in tourist activity, has decreased. The contribution of tourism, to the economy, has similarly decreased. There is a small, but significant, number of people engaged in tourism-related employment: particularly in certain regional areas of NSW. Overseas tourist visits to Australia (and NSW) have been increasing slightly, but Australia’s share of total overseas travel has been declining. Overseas tourists, while a much smaller proportion of tourist numbers in Australia, individually spend much more than domestic tourists. Events (in recent years) have been seen as a means to both boosting tourist activity overall and attracting increasing numbers of higher-spending overseas tourists. John O’Neill (CEO of the Australian Rugby Union from 1995 - 2003) produced three reviews, earlier in 2008, with significant observations for events and tourism in NSW. The Rees government, in its <b>mini-budget,</b> has announced new funding initiatives for tourism in New South Wales. Asian countries have the potential to become the source of a faster growing number of inbound tourists. Asian football popularity has the potential to enhance the success of a World Cup staged in Australia...|$|R
5000|$|Greiner {{handed over}} a number of {{responsibilities}} previously associated with the Premier's Department to other ministers, but in a rare move, served as his own Treasurer, in order to focus on repairing the State's parlous financial position. The Greiner government, which promised [...] "sensible, moderate but progressive" [...] government, wasted no time in commencing its legislative agenda, announcing across-the-board spending cuts and plans to announce a <b>mini-budget</b> in June. A key government policy was to cut costs in education, including increasing charges for public education, eliminating free public transport for school students and reducing teaching staff (2,400 teaching staff and 800 support staff) through creating composite classes and closing smaller schools, while looking for public assets to sell (ultimately $340 million of assets were identified) and capital works projects which could be abandoned. However, it was forced to defer its plans to repeal Aboriginal land rights legislation (an election commitment) and reduce the power of the Ombudsman to investigate the police when Democrat and Call to Australia members of the Upper House combined with Labor to defeat these pieces of legislation. By September 1988, having promised at the election to run the state like a business, the government were able to announce serious progress towards reducing the state debt and its first budget projected a surplus, and were trying to resolve housing pressures caused by rapidly increasing house prices (which rose from $65,000 to $165,000 in the twelve months to October). Another election promise realised by the new Government was to create the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) capable of investigating allegations of corruption and graft against the government and within the state. In its first year, it investigated large donations to the Labor and National parties. Despite significant pressure from the parliamentary Nationals, whose leader was implicated in one of the investigations, Greiner refused to budge or to dilute ICAC's powers.|$|R
