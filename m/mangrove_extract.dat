40|$|ABSTRACT: Mangroves {{have a lot}} of {{economic}} and ecological advantages which include {{but are not limited to}} coastal protection, habitat for wildlife, fisheries and forestry products. Determination of the extent and density of the mangrove patches in the coastal areas of the Philippines is therefore important especially in resource conservation, protection and management. This starts with a well-defined and accurate map. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light, was used in the extraction of Mangroves in the coastal area of EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. Total coastal study area is 143 km. Derivatives that were used in the extraction include Digital Terrain Model (DTM), Digital Surface Model (DSM), Intensity, Number of Returns, and Canopy Height Model (CHM). The RGB bands of the Orthographic photographs taken at the same time with the LiDAR data was also used as one of the layers during the processing. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) and CHM using Canny Edge Layer was derived as well to produce an enhanced segmentation. Training and Validation points were collected through field validation and visual inspection. The points were then used to feed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on tall structures (CHM> 1).

30|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) {{is a primary}} food source for sponge-bacterial consortia (de Goeij et al. 2008 a, b), {{and it has been}} {{hypothesized}} that DOM leaching from mangrove roots {{plays an important role in}} structuring mangrove sponge community composition (Hunting et al. 2010 b). Mangrove DOM consists mainly of tannins and polyphenolic compounds (Maie and Jaffe 2006), which are structurally complex and recalcitrant to biodegradation (Field and Lettinga 1992; Koch et al. 2005; Kristensen et al. 2008), thereby reducing mangrove palatability and inhibiting growth of fouling organisms on mangrove roots (e.g., Schmitt et al. 1998). A limited number of bacterial and fungal species are able to degrade complex polyphenols and tannins (Bhat et al. 1998). Therefore, the ability of mangrove-associated sponge-bacterial consortia to degrade mangrove DOM may explain the persistence of mangrove species in mangrove ecosystems, while the inability to degrade mangrove DOM could potentially hamper fouling of roots by reef species. However, this remains to be proven experimentally. This study therefore aimed to test whether mangrove DOM leachates from roots are responsible for the observed deterioration of reef species transplanted to mangrove roots. To this end, we (1) transplanted a typical reef species and a typical mangrove species to mimicry substrates containing <b>mangrove</b> root <b>extract</b> and to control substrates without extract; and (2) injected mangrove DOM directly into tissues of both sponge species.|$|R

40|$|Tree {{parameter}} determinations using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) {{have been}} conducted in many forest types, including coniferous, boreal, and deciduous. However, {{there are only a}} few scientific articles discussing the application of LiDAR to mangrove biophysical parameter extraction at an individual tree level. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of using LiDAR data to estimate the biophysical parameters of mangrove trees at an individual tree scale. The Variable Window Filtering (VWF) and Inverse Watershed Segmentation (IWS) methods were investigated by comparing their performance in individual tree detection and in deriving tree position, crown diameter, and tree height using the LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM). The results demonstrated that each method performed well in mangrove forests with a low percentage of crown overlap conditions. The VWF method yielded a slightly higher accuracy for mangrove parameter extractions from LiDAR data compared with the IWS method. This is because the VWF method uses an adaptive circular filtering window size based on an allometric relationship. As a result of the VWF method, the position measurements of individual tree indicated a mean distance error value of 1. 10 m. The individual tree detection showed a kappa coefficient of agreement (K) value of 0. 78. The estimation of crown diameter produced a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0. 75, a Root Mean Square Error of the Estimate (RMSE) value of 1. 65 m, and a Relative Error (RE) value of 19. 7 %. Tree height determination from LiDAR yielded an R 2 value of 0. 80, an RMSE value of 1. 42 m, and an RE value of 19. 2 %. However, there are some limitations in the mangrove parameters derived from LiDAR. The results indicated that an increase in the percentage of crown overlap (COL) results in an accuracy decrease of the <b>mangrove</b> parameters <b>extracted</b> from the LiDAR-derived CHM, particularly for crown measurements. In this study, the accuracy of LiDAR-derived biophysical parameters in mangrove forests using the VWF and IWS methods is lower than in coniferous, boreal, pine, and deciduous forests. An adaptive allometric equation that is specific for the level of tree density and percentage of crown overlap is a solution for improving the predictive accuracy of the VWF method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Biosynthesis of {{nanoparticles}} {{has received}} increasing attention {{due to the}} growing need to develop safe, time-effective and environmentally friendly technologies for nano-materials synthesis. This paper reports the one pot green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the leaf bud <b>extract</b> of a <b>mangrove</b> plant, Rhizophora mucronata and their antimicrobial effects against aquatic pathogens. Highly stable AgNPs were synthesized by treating the <b>mangrove</b> leaf bud <b>extract</b> with aqueous silver nitrate solution at 15 [*]psi pressure and 121 °C for 5 minutes. Results The biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectrum, at 426 [*]nm. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed the face-centered cubic geometry of AgNPs. Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis was carried out to identify the possible biomolecules responsible for biosynthesis of AgNPs from the leaf bud extract. The {{size and shape of}} the well-dispersed AgNPs were documented with the help of High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) with a diameter ranged from 4 to 26 [*]nm. However a maximum number of particles were observed at 4 [*]nm in size. The antibacterial effects of AgNPs were studied against aquatic pathogens Proteus spp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Flavobacterium spp., isolated from infected marine ornamental fish, Dascyllus trimaculatus. Conclusion This study reveals that the biosynthesized AgNPs using the leaf bud <b>extract</b> of a <b>mangrove</b> plant (R. mucronata) were found equally potent to synthetic antibiotics. The size of the inhibition zone increases when the concentration of the AgNPs increased and varies according to species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mangroves {{have a lot}} of {{economic}} and ecological advantages which include coastal protection, habitat for wildlife, fisheries and forestry products. Determination of the extent of mangrove patches in the coastal areas of the Philippines is therefore important especially in resource conservation, protection and management. This starts with a well-defined and accurate map. LiDARwas used in the mangrove extraction in the different coastal areas of Negros Occidental in Western Visayas, Philippines. Total coastal study area is 1, 082. 55 km² for the 14 municipalities/ cities processed. Derivatives that were used in the extraction include, DSM, DTM, Hillshade, Intensity, Number of Returns and PCA. The RGB bands of the Orthographic photographs taken at the same time with the LiDAR data were also used as one of the layers during the processing. NDVI, GRVI and Hillshade using Canny Edge Layer were derived as well to produce an enhanced segmentation. Training and Validation points were collected through field validation and visual inspection using Stratified Random Sampling. The points were then used to feed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on tall structures. Only four classes were used, namely, Built-up, Mangroves, Other Trees and Sugarcane. Buffering and contextual editing were incorporated to reclassify the <b>extracted</b> <b>mangroves.</b> Overall accuracy assessment is at 98. 73 % (KIA of 98. 24 %) while overall accuracy assessment for Mangroves only is at 98. 00 %. Using this workflow, mangroves can already be extracted in a large-scale level with acceptable overall accuracy assessments...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mangroves are salt-tolerant plants {{located at}} the fringes of {{tropical}} and subtropical zones. They play key roles in mitigation of natural hazards such as shoreline erosion reduction and protection from storm surges and tsunamis. In addition, mangrove ecosystems {{are one of the}} most diverse and most productive ecosystems on earth. In light of the increasing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones hitting the Philippines due to a warming earth and the reported shrinking of mangrove forests, an inventory of mangrove vegetation shielding the islands is urgently needed. In the past, there were efforts to map mangrove vegetation in the Philippines using Landsat imageries. However, the resolution was insufficient to estimate the mangrove patches at the municipality level. Recently, airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has provided opportunities for detailed mapping of natural resources such as mangroves. In this study, we propose a context-based method to <b>extract</b> <b>mangrove</b> patches from LiDAR data. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm is context-based due to the fact that the parameters used are based on the actual nature of mangrove patches. It only utilizes two derivatives: the digital terrain model (DTM) and the canopy height model (CHM), which were generated using LAStools. The method primarily uses the following parameters: tidal height, canopy height, Shannon entropy, and patch area. The tidal height was used for estimating the intertidal zone. The CHM was used for excluding vegetation that are to...|$|R
40|$|Mangrove {{products}} have been historically {{used by many}} indigenous populations in tropical coastal areas worldwide. One {{of these is the}} use of <b>mangrove</b> ashes to <b>extract</b> alkali for soap production. However, until recent times, few examples of industrial uses (i. e. transformation of raw material by artificial, non-artisanal means into secondary products) of mangrove were restricted to the use of tannins in the leather industry (Lacerda, 1999). We report here one of the first, if not the very first, example of industrial use of mangrove products, which was also {{regarded as one of the}} initial steps in the development of the Brazilian chemical industry: the development in the early 19 th century of an industrial process of hard soap production based on mangrove leaves ash in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Lacerda, 1999). Soap has been known by mankind for about 2, 000 years, as a mixture of alkali and fatty materials, in general animal fat. Before the invention of the Le Blanc and more recently the Solvay process of saponification, natural sources of alkali were obtained by evaporation of naturally alkaline waters, relatively rare and time consuming or the leaching of bulk wood ash, which gave very low yields. These two sources hampered the development of an actual, large-scale industrial process of soap making, keeping its production as an artisanal method for millennia (Shreve & Brink, 1977). In this context, mangroves played a key, but unsuspected role in the industrial production of soap and in the development of 19 th century Brazilian chemical industry. On 25 th January 1812...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of mangrove forests in carbon sequestration and coastal protection {{has been widely}} acknowledged. Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, {{it is unclear how}} small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (- 32. 1 ± 8. 4 mm yr - 1 compared with surface elevation changes of + 4. 2 ± 1. 4 mm yr - 1 in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25. 3 ± 7. 4 tCO 2 ha - 1 yr - 1 (using surface carbon efflux) and 35. 6 ± 76. 9 tCO 2 ha - 1 yr - 1 (using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between <b>extracting</b> <b>mangrove</b> wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to provide high resolution local, regional, national and global estimates of annual mangrove forest area from 2000 through to 2012. To achieve this we synthesize the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database, and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to <b>extract</b> <b>mangrove</b> forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then use the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26 percent and 29 percent of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0. 26 percent and 0. 66 percent annually. Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0. 16 percent and 0. 39 percent annually. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3. 58 percent and 8. 08 percent during the analysis period, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, {{with the exception of the}} largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized global spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatiotemporal resolutions, covering 99 percent of all mangrove forests. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda particularly as it pertains to improved monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.

40|$|The {{accurate}} quantification {{of forest}} 3 -D structure {{is of great}} importance for studies of the global carbon cycle and biodiversity. These studies are especially relevant in Africa, where deforestation rates are high {{and the lack of}} background data is great. Mangrove forests are ecologically significant and it is important to measure mangrove canopy heights and biomass. The objectives of this study are to estimate: 1. The total area, 2. Canopy height distributions and 3. Aboveground biomass of mangrove forests in Africa. To derive mangrove 3 -D structure and biomass maps, we used a combination of mangrove maps derived from Landsat ETM+, LiDAR canopy height estimates from ICEsat/GLAS (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and elevation data from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) for the African continent. More specifically, we <b>extracted</b> <b>mangrove</b> forest areas on the SRTM DEM using Landsat based landcover maps. The LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) measurements from the large footprint GLAS sensor were used to derive local estimates of canopy height and calibrate the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from SRTM. We then applied allometric equations relating canopy height to biomass in order to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) from the canopy height product. The total mangrove area of Africa was estimated to be 25 960 square kilometers with 83 % accuracy. The largest mangrove areas and greatest total biomass was 29 found in Nigeria covering 8 573 km 2 with 132 x 10 (exp 6) Mg AGB. Canopy height across Africa was estimated with an overall root mean square error of 3. 55 m. This error also includes the impact of using sensors with different resolutions and geolocation error which make comparison between measurements sensitive to canopy heterogeneities. This study provides the first systematic estimates of mangrove area, height and biomass in Africa. Our results showed that the combination of ICEsat/GLAS and SRTM data is well suited for vegetation 3 -D mapping on a continental scale...|$|R
