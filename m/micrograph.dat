40|$|Three-dimensional {{reconstruction}} of ribosome particles from electron <b>micrographs</b> requires selection of many single-particle images. Roughly 100, 000 particles {{are required to}} achieve approximately 10 angstrom resolution. Manual selection of particles, by visual observation of the <b>micrographs</b> on a computer screen, is recognized as a bottleneck in automated single particle reconstruction. This paper describes an efficient approach for automated boxing of ribosome particles in <b>micrographs.</b> Use of a fast, anisotropic non-linear reaction-diffusion method to pre-process <b>micrographs</b> and rank-leveling to enhance the contrast between particles and the background, followed by binary and morphological segmentation constitute {{the core of this}} technique. Modifying the shape of the particles to facilitate segmentation of individual particles within clusters and boxing the isolated particles is successfully attempted. Tests on a limited number of <b>micrographs</b> have shown that over 80 percent success is achieved in automatic particle picking...|$|R
25|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} is {{an optical}} imaging technique used to increase <b>micrograph</b> contrast and to reconstruct three-dimensional images {{by using a}} spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light or flare in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane. This technique has gained popularity in the scientific and industrial communities. Typical applications include life sciences and semiconductor inspection. The principle of confocal imaging was invented and patented by Marvin Minsky in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the very}} narrow {{electron}} beam, SEM micrographs have a {{large depth of field}} yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample. This is exemplified by the <b>micrograph</b> of pollen shown above. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 10 times (about equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to more than 500,000 times, about 250 times the magnification limit of the best light microscopes.|$|E
25|$|Pollen is {{produced}} in the microsporangia in the male cone of a conifer or other gymnosperm or in the anthers of an angiosperm flower. Pollen grains come {{in a wide variety}} of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see electron <b>micrograph,</b> right). Pollen grains of pines, firs, and spruces are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the forget-me-not (Myosotis spp.), is around 6µm (0.006mm) in diameter. Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100µm.|$|E
40|$|Pt K 2 rat {{kangaroo}} {{epithelial cells}} and Rat- 1 fibroblasts were grown on conductive glass discs, fixed, and permeabilized, and the cytoskeletal elements actin, keratin, and vimentin were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. After the fluorescence microscopy, {{the cells were}} postfixed and dehydrated for photoelectron microscopy. The contrast in these photoelectron <b>micrographs</b> is primarily topographical in origin, {{and the presence of}} fluorescent dyes at low density does not contribute significantly to the material contrast. By comparison with fluorescence <b>micrographs</b> obtained on the same individual cells, actin-containing stress fibers, keratin filaments, and vimentin filaments were identified in the photoelectron <b>micrographs.</b> The apparent volume occupied by the cytoskeletal network in the cells as judged from the photoelectron <b>micrographs</b> is much less than it appears to be from the fluorescence <b>micrographs</b> because the higher resolution of photoelectron microscopy shows the fibers closer to their true dimensions. Photoelectron microscopy is a surface technique, and the images highlight the exposed cytoskeletal structures and suppress those extending along the substrate below the nuclei. The results reported here show marked improvement in image quality of photoelectron <b>micrographs</b> and that this technique has the potential of contributing to higher resolution studies of cytoskeletal structures...|$|R

25|$|In some {{configurations}} {{information about}} several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually {{by the use}} of multiple detectors. In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a single color image by assigning a different primary color to each attribute. Similarly, a combination of backscattered and secondary electron signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a single color <b>micrograph</b> displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.|$|E

Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron <b>micrograph</b> images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children, its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects animals, and is a pathogen of livestock.|$|E

Bruker Dimension ICON-PT atomic force microscopy (AFM) <b>micrographs</b> (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI, USA), along with the SEM <b>micrographs,</b> were used to study the effect of anodization time on the tubes’ surface morphology. AFM <b>micrographs</b> using the PeakForce QNM (Bruker AXS) technique were obtained using ultra sharp AFM tips (10 [*]nm diameter). The AFM <b>micrographs</b> were obtained at three different regions, and the average value {{was used for the}} roughness. Diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (UV- 3600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to characterize the band gap of the material. X-ray diffraction, utilizing the Philips X’Pert X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands), with incidence angles ranging from 20 ° to 80 ° was used for identification of crystalline phases and determination of stress in the nanotubes.|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{image analysis}} system for determining myosin filament azimuthal rotations, or orientations, in electron <b>micrographs</b> of muscle cross sections is described. The <b>micrographs</b> of thin sections intersect the myosin filaments which lie on a triangular lattice. The myosin filament profiles are variable and noisy, and the images exhibit a variable contrast and background. Filament positions are determined by filtering with a point spread function that incorporates the local symmetry of the lattice. Filament orientations are determined by correlation with a template that incorporates the salient filament characteristics, and the orientations are classified using a Gaussian mixture model. The precision of the technique is assessed by application {{to a variety of}} <b>micrographs</b> and comparison with manual classification of the orientations. The system provides a convenient, robust, and rapid means of analysing <b>micrographs</b> containing many filaments to study the distribution of filament orientations...|$|R
