Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the <b>month</b> <b>was</b> exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people and roughly US$295million in damage.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous <b>month,</b> <b>was</b> also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E

5|$|In late April, the Chinese {{launched}} a major counterattack. 486,000 Chinese troops assaulted I Corps and IX Corps' {{sector of the}} lines. Most of the UN forces were able to hold their ground, but the Chinese broke through at Kapyong, where the South Korean 6th Division was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the American divisions to the west. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold. A second offensive the next <b>month</b> <b>was</b> similarly unsuccessful, as Chinese and North Korean forces suffered heavy casualties but were unable to push back the Eighth Army forces. The I and IX Corps had blunted the offensive at the No Name Line, just north of Seoul.|$|E
5|$|James E. Boyd, who {{had assumed}} the vice chancellorship of the University System of Georgia the {{previous}} <b>month,</b> <b>was</b> appointed Acting President of Georgia Tech by Chancellor George L. Simpson in May 1971. Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience {{as director of the}} Engineering Experiment Station, and his ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the EES should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked <b>month</b> <b>was</b> the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March, before Rowley {{could return}} to his blockade, Hamelin ordered a {{squadron}} to sea. This force consisted of the large frigate Bellone, the captured Minerva now renamed Minerve and the captured brig Victor. The force was led by Guy-Victor Duperré on Bellone, with Pierre Bouvet in Minerve as his second in command. Avoiding the remaining frigates of the British blockade, Duperré's ships escaped unnoticed and began cruising in the Bay of Bengal, capturing a few small vessels but making no serious impression on British trade in the region. By the 1 June, Duperré {{had moved to the}} Western Indian Ocean, sailing off Madagascar in the hope of sighting British ships from Cape Town. Due to the extended period at sea, his ships were in a poor state of repair and much of the following <b>month</b> <b>was</b> spent conducting repairs at isolated beaches.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June 1913, the Tsardom of Bulgaria {{declared}} war on Greece, thus starting the Second Balkan War. On 4 July, Romania entered the war, allying itself with Greece. The war, which lasted {{a little over a}} <b>month,</b> <b>was</b> worsened by a cholera epidemic. Marie would look upon her first encounter with an epidemic as a turning point in her life. With the help of Dr. Ioan Cantacuzino and Sister Pucci, a Red Cross nurse, Marie travelled between Romania and Bulgaria, lending a helping hand in hospitals. These events would prepare her for her experiences in the Great War. As a result of the war, Romania gained possession of Southern Dobrudja, including the coastal town of Balchik (Balcic), which Marie would come to cherish in 1924 and use to host her residence. Soon after the war ended, Carol became ill.|$|E

The contingent sailed on 21 October, arrived in late November, and was on active service within a week. Davies was promoted to Major in May 1900, and in the same <b>month</b> <b>was</b> given temporary command of the Third New Zealand Contingent.

Carpentier was vocal in his criticism of the organisation of the track, saying that the track personnel should have been ready a month before the race was held, while Kanaan admitted that he was concerned, feeling that the situation was not good for everyone. The 15,000 spectators who were in attendance on Thursday were issued cash refunds.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Vols {{returned}} home and resumed their SEC schedule against in-state foe Vanderbilt, who was {{ranked in the}} top 10. Throughout the first half, the game was about even, until the Lady Vols got a slight lead with under seven minutes left, which they took to the locker room, 37–31. The second half, however, started out much differently, beginning with a 20–0 Lady Vols run. Tennessee led by as many as 35 points in the game, and ended the game with an 86–54 win. Catchings was named the SEC Player of the Week for her role in the DePaul and Vanderbilt games, scoring 35 and 22 points respectively. The final game of the <b>month</b> <b>was</b> the rematch with Georgia. It ended up being a blowout.

5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that <b>month,</b> <b>was</b> not adequately opposed either.|$|E
