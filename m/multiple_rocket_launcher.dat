5|$|The GUNT-Libyan {{alliance}} invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habré had entrenched {{himself with}} about 5,000 troops. Battered by <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT {{troops on the}} ground. Habré escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> for the RS-132 aircraft rocket (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, {{the result was the}} BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanized}} divisions {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, {{and a full}} complement of 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments consisted of two anti-aircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E

25|$|During the Cold War, the {{division}} was maintained at 20–25% strength. On 19 November 1990, according to CFE Treaty data, {{the division}} {{was equipped with}} 62 T-72 tanks, 139 BTR-70 and 25 BTR-60 armored personnel carriers, 36 BMP-1 and 15 BMP-1K infantry fighting vehicles, 12 2S1 Gvozdika and 36 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled guns, and 12 BM-21 Grad <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> systems. On 17 April 1991, the division was merged with the 27th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which had arrived from Germany. The 680th and 691st Motor Rifle Regiments, the 34th Tank Regiment, and the 1283rd Artillery Regiment were merged with regiments of the 27th to create new units, which inherited the lineage of the 27th Division unit. The 433rd Motor Rifle Regiment {{was transferred to the}} 27th intact, replacing its disbanded 244th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Fourth Phase Campaign, the PVA 13th Army's 38th and 42nd Corps were forced to leave the frontline for rest and refit, while its 50th and 66th Corps were evacuated back to China. Following Mao's orders, however, the PLA 3rd and 19th Army began to enter Korea in February 1951, alongside four field artillery divisions, two long range artillery divisions, four anti-aircraft divisions, one <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> division and four tank regiments. The PVA 9th Army had also returned to the front in April 1951 after four months of rest. Those development soon brought the total PVA strength to over one million men, including 548,000 combat personnel and 180,000 logistics personnel. On April 21, 1951, the 39th and 40th Corps of the PVA 13th Army were placed under 9th Army's control. On April 22, 1951, the reorganized PVA launched a full-scale offensive in Korea, and the resulting clashes between Chinese and UN forces is often described as the largest battle of the entire Korean War.|$|E
500|$|The Katyusha <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> (...) {{is a type}} of rocket {{artillery}} first {{built and}} fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II. Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but are inexpensive, easy to produce, and usable on any chassis. The Katyushas of World War II, the first self-propelled artillery mass-produced by the Soviet Union, were usually mounted on ordinary trucks. This mobility gave the Katyusha, and other self-propelled artillery, another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at once, and then move before being located and attacked with counter-battery fire.|$|E

500|$|Tyrants {{have been}} {{consistently}} depicted as grotesque and brutally violent creatures, but their intelligence has varied. The first two Tyrants in Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil are depicted as unintelligent, while the T-103 (Mr. X) in Resident Evil 2 and the titular Nemesis T-Type in [...] are shown to possess limited intelligence {{and the ability}} to carry out specific instructions. Both Nemesis and the T-103 series (two more T-103 Tyrants, code-named Ivan, appear in [...] ) are prone to uncontrolled mutation when damaged. Alexia Ashford in Code Veronica retains her full intelligence after being exposed to the T-Veronica virus and gains psychic abilities, including pyrokinesis; similarly, the TG-virus mutated Morpheus D. Duvall in [...] (Tyrant T-092) gains [...] bio-electric abilities. The weapons used by Tyrants have also varied; while most Tyrants in the Resident Evil series rely on sheer physical force to subdue opponents, Nemesis, retaining some intelligence due to the Nemesis parasite, is able to use a shoulder-fired hand-held rocket launcher (and a minigun in [...] ) and T-ALOS (Tyrant-Armored Lethal Organic System) in The Umbrella Chronicles is equipped with a shoulder-mounted <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b>|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the British had {{equipped}} their warships with unrotated projectile unguided anti-aircraft rockets, and by 1940, the Germans had developed a surface-to-surface <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> the Nebelwerfer and the Soviets already had introduced the RS-132 air-to-ground rocket.

2500|$|A new {{attempt was}} made at the IDEF 2013 exhibition. Russia {{presented}} its Ka-50-based Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter and the Mi-28NE Night Hunter. The proposal to start joint development of a surface-to-air missile system with Ankara {{was perhaps the most}} intriguing development of IDEF 2013. The SAM would be based on the Russian S-300V Antey-2500 system. Besides the Antey, Moscow has offered the Buk-M2E and the Tor-M2E surface-to-air missile system, and the Pantsir-S1 combined missile and artillery system. Exhibited mock-ups included the T-90S tank, Terminator fire support combat vehicle, the BMP-3M infantry combat vehicle, the BTR-80 and the BTR-80A Armored Personnel Carriers, the Smerch <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> the Kornet and the Metis-M anti-tank missile systems, the Msta-S 152-milimeter howitzer, the 2S9 120-milemeter self-propelled mortar, and the Vena self-propelled automated artillery system.|$|E
2500|$|Shusha {{sits on a}} mountaintop {{overlooking}} the NKR's highly populated capital, Stepanakert (just 5km away), from an elevation of 600m. An old fortress with high walls, the town is five kilometers (four miles) {{to the south of}} Stepanakert and perched on a mountaintop with limited vehicular access to reach it. From a geographical standpoint Shusha was well-suited for Azerbaijani shelling of Stepanakert. The main type of artillery used in the bombardment, which began on January 10, 1992, was the Soviet-made BM-21 GRAD <b>multiple</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> which was capable of firing 40 rockets in one volley. The GRAD launcher was similar to the World War II-era Katyusha in that it did not have a guided missile system and hence the location of where it would hit was difficult to determine. Dubbed [...] "flying telephone poles" [...] due to their long, shaped charges, the missiles caused devastating damage to buildings including the destruction of residential houses, schools, the city's silk factory and maternity hospital.|$|E
