60|$|Mose {{took her}} hand but did not invite her to join him. However, she needed no invitation, and taking a seat opposite, leaned her {{elbows on the table}} and looked at him with eyes more inscrutable than ever--despite their nearness. They were a <b>mottled</b> <b>yellow</b> and brown, he noticed, unusual and {{interesting}} eyes, but by contrast with the clear deeps of Mary's eyes they seemed like those of some beautiful wild beast. He could not penetrate a thousandth part of a hair line beyond the exterior shine of her glance. The woman's soul was in the unfathomable shadow beneath.|$|E
60|$|After dinner we all {{set out on}} a walk, in {{the course}} of which we called at a bookseller's shop to show U---- an {{enormous}} cat, which I had already seen. It is of the Angora breed, of a <b>mottled</b> <b>yellow</b> color, and is really a wonder; as big and broad as a tolerably sized dog, very soft and silken, and apparently of the gentlest disposition. I never imagined the like, nor felt anything so deeply soft as this great beast. Its master seems very fond and proud of it; and, great favorite as the cat is, she does not take airs upon herself, but is gently shy and timid in her demonstrations.|$|E

The ventral scales are generally white, but males of all species and females of Ptenopus carpi have yellow throats.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} a large {{spreading}} tree, which may reach 35 m in height. The rough furrowed bark is grey <b>mottled</b> with <b>yellow</b> and orange. The tree's name ironbark stems from the rough and unyielding texture of the cambium on the outmost layer of the plant.

40|$|Whereas genetic {{factors are}} known to {{influence}} both susceptibility to carcinogens {{and the capacity to}} respond to specific antigenic stimuli, little is known regarding the influence of phenotype per se. With this in mind, we utilized (YS x VY) F 1 hybrid mice consisting of genetically identical (Avy/a) but phenotypically distinct (<b>mottled</b> <b>yellow</b> and pseudoagouti) mice as well as congeneic (a/a) black mice to evaluate immunocompetence as a function of genotype and phenotype. <b>Mottled</b> <b>yellow</b> Avy/a mice, which are fat and have increased susceptibility to neoplasia, presented an immunologic profile characterized by decreased antibody response to the T-cell-dependent immunogen tetanus toxoid, enhanced antibody response to the T-cell-independent immunogen type III pneumococcal polysaccharide, decreased (unadjusted) rates of carbon clearance, and increased levels of serum IgA. In contrast, pseudoagouti Avy/a mice were immunologically comparable to black a/a mice. The data demonstrate that differences in phenotypic expression between genetically identical mice may significantly alter immune function...|$|E

Figure 1 - An 18 -year-old Pinus radiata {{stand with}} two severely affected trees (left front showing the yellowing of foliage {{typical of the}} disease. Diagnostic features In spring (late August/September), foliage over {{all or part of}} a tree crown turns a mottled yellow-green, then brown. Most infected needles prematurely shed by December (Figures 1 and 2). Newly flushed needles resistant to infection and remain green.

Figure 3 - Fruiting bodies of C. minus on Pinus radiata needle. Note: Not all foliage yellowing is caused by Cyclaneusma (Figure 4) - magnesium deficiency in particular can produce similar symptoms. However, yellowing from magnesium deficiency begins only at the needle tips; all needles within a fascicle, and all fascicles within a flush of growth, are affected to a similar extent, whereas Cyclaneusma affects needles to different degrees.
