5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, <b>masked</b> <b>booby</b> and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the sooty tern, blue noddy, brown noddy, lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
25|$|Dry Tortugas National Park has an {{official}} bird list of 299 species. Of these, only eight species frequently nest within the park: sooty tern, brown noddy, brown pelican, magnificent frigatebird, <b>masked</b> <b>booby,</b> roseate tern, bridled tern and mourning dove. The park features the only nesting colonies of sooty tern, brown noddy, magnificent frigatebird, and <b>masked</b> <b>booby</b> in the contiguous United States.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-three {{species of}} birds were found in a 1969 survey, of which 19 were {{observed}} during a follow-up count in 1988. Species breeding in larger numbers that year included the great frigatebird and red-footed booby. Their numbers appear reduced due {{to the destruction of}} the Pisonia forests. Other breeding species include the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, the <b>masked</b> <b>booby,</b> brown booby, white tern, brown noddy, and sooty tern.|$|E

25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, <b>masked</b> <b>booby,</b> terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E

[...] The NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 identifies the migratory little tern (Sterna albifrons) and the Beach stone-curlew (Esacus neglectus) as endangered. Seabirds that utilize the Cape Byron Marine Park are the providence pretal (Pterodroma solandri), flesh-footed shearwater (Puffinus carneipes), and the <b>masked</b> <b>booby</b> (Sula dactylatra) which are protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.|$|E

2500|$|However, booby {{parents may}} not be as {{indifferent}} as they seem. Experimental evidence suggests that the parental behavior described above may be masking parent-offspring conflict. It was discovered that blue-footed booby parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of the younger chick by the older sibling. This is in direct contrast to the <b>masked</b> <b>booby,</b> a species in which siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject younger chicks from their flat nests. When blue-footed booby nests were experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original steepness. [...] In another experiment, blue-footed booby chicks that were placed in <b>masked</b> <b>booby</b> nests were {{more likely to engage in}} siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Parents also appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body conditions during periods of food deprivation. [...] Egg-mass analysis shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season, the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first. Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into the second egg. [...] Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that there appears to be no parental favoritism in regards to androgen allocation. It is important to note, however, that this may simply be that the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output. Experiments show that what may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInter- and {{intraspecific}} competition {{can lead to}} resource partitioning in sympatric species, processes likely affected by environmental productivity and population size. We investigated the foraging behaviour and diet of masked (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed (S. sula) boobies at Tromelin Island, western Indian Ocean, to examine the role of resource partitioning in the foraging strategies of these sympatric species in an extreme oligotrophic environment. We compared our results to published studies with differing environmental conditions or population sizes. We used GPS loggers and Argos transmitters to track foraging movements and used time-depth recorders to estimate dive depths. <b>Masked</b> <b>boobies</b> travelled further and at faster rates than red-footed boobies, and sexes {{did not differ in}} foraging behaviour. Based on randomization tests, the foraging range of each species (95 % utilization distribution; UD) overlapped significantly. However, at core foraging areas (50 % and 25 % UD), interspecific segregation was greater than expected by chance alone. No intraspecific spatial segregation was detected between sexes. Environmental characteristics of area-restricted search zones differed between species, but not sexes; <b>masked</b> <b>boobies</b> utilized warmer, deeper, and less windy oceanic environments than red-footed <b>boobies.</b> <b>Masked</b> <b>boobies</b> attained greater diving depths than red-footed boobies and consumed primarily flying fish, whereas red-footed boobies consumed mostly squid. Red-footed and <b>masked</b> <b>boobies</b> breeding in the extreme oligotrophic environment near Tromelin demonstrated greater dietary partitioning differences in foraging ranges compared to a less oligotrophic environment. This suggests that environmental productivity {{may play a role in}} processes of resource partitioning in these sympatric species...|$|R
50|$|Migratory waders {{recorded}} in the islands include some regular visitors as well as vagrants. None breeds there. However, North Keeling is important for breeding seabirds, with sizeable numbers of red-footed boobies, great and lesser frigatebirds, common noddies and white terns. Other breeding seabirds include wedge-tailed shearwaters, <b>masked</b> <b>boobies,</b> brown boobies, red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbirds, and sooty terns.

Bird species include white terns, <b>masked</b> <b>boobies,</b> sooty terns, brown boobies, brown noddies, black noddies, greater frigates, coots, martins, cuckoos and yellow warblers.

The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of the large breeding colony of <b>masked</b> <b>boobies,</b> with 110,000 individual birds recorded.

50|$|Malden is an {{important}} breeding island for about a dozen species including <b>masked</b> <b>boobies</b> (Sula dactylatra), red-footed booby (Sula sula), tropicbirds (Phaethontidae), great frigatebird (Fregata minor), lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), grey-backed tern (Onychoprion lunata), red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), sooty terns (sterna fuscata) It is also {{an important}} winter-stop for the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis), a migrant from Alaska; and other migratory seabirds (nineteen species in all).|$|R
5000|$|The island’s <b>masked</b> <b>boobies</b> are of {{the western}} Indian Ocean {{subspecies}} (Sula dactylatra melanops), of which Tromelin is a stronghold. The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation. Both great and lesser frigatebirds used to nest on the island.

50|$|Great {{frigatebirds}} {{will attempt}} kleptoparasitism, chasing other nesting seabirds (boobies and tropicbirds in particular) {{in order to}} make them regurgitate their food.
