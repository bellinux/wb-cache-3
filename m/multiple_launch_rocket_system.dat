In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E

25|$|Oshkosh Defense {{unveiled}} the Global HET in 2008. The Global HET {{is similar in}} many ways to the M1070A1, the main design difference being configuration. The Global HET has three axles, the M1070A1 has four. Oshkosh disclosed an initial order from Al Jaber Group of the UAE for around 20 Global HET in February 2011.

25|$|U.S. {{ground forces}} {{included}} a battalion from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania {{in support of}} the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the Tirana airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for <b>Multiple</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> <b>System</b> (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for allied/NATO air strikes. Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of Operation Joint Guardian.|$|E

25|$|With the {{reduction}} {{of the size of the}} ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to emphasize the importance of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. Subsequent to this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, advanced attack helicopters and armored vehicles, <b>Multiple</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> <b>System</b> and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force.|$|E

5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type <b>multiple</b> <b>launch</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>systems,</b> including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|R
2500|$|The {{military}} has also stressed military [...] "self-reliance," [...] {{which has led}} to the growth of indigenous military production, producing items such as the ROC's Indigenous Defense Fighter, the Thunderbolt 2000 <b>Multiple</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> <b>System,</b> Clouded Leopard Armoured Vehicle, the Sky Bow I and Sky Bow II SAMs and Hsiung Feng series of anti-ship missiles. The ROC's efforts at arms purchases have consistently been opposed by the PRC. The PRC has also consistently attempted to block cooperation between the ROC military and those of other countries.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 2003 an F-15E pilot mistook a M270 <b>Multiple</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> <b>System</b> (MLRS) for an Iraqi {{surface-to-air missile}} site and dropped a [...] laser-guided bomb, killing three and {{wounding}} five others. On 7 April 2003, an F-15E (88–1694), crewed by Captain Eric Das and Major William Watkins performed a critical interdiction mission {{in support of}} special forces. [...] Das and Watkins crashed while bombing targets around Tikrit probably shot down by AAA fire.

5000|$|During the Gulf War, {{however, the}} GHN-45s proved less {{effective}} than anticipated by either side. Air strikes had disrupted the Iraqi {{command and control}} facilities, and because most of their gun tractors had been withdrawn to serve with logistics units {{in an attempt to}} re-supply the front line troops, they were unable to withdraw when under fire. [...] Immobile and unsupported, the majority of the guns were destroyed at their positions either by air strikes or <b>Multiple</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLRS) counter-battery fire.|$|R

The integrated fire exercise signified that the two allied forces took North Korea's shelling attack seriously and demonstrated their strong determination to respond to any further provocation through powerful forces of the two allies.|$|R
