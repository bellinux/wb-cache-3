500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008. Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News, [...] "I {{thought it would}} be funny {{to see if we could}} get [...] to read very, very dense historical documents centering around the second World War, [...] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self-analysis, which I thought was funny." [...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E

5000|$|West {{realized}} throughout {{reading the}} stories [...] "he had {{been blessed with}} a sheltered existence" [...] that he said [...] "writing about these things allowed me to see that I have a very narrow view of the world." [...] This {{was one of the}} reasons [...] "folks have criticized <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>'singing</b> to the choir,' which this allowed West sometime of introspection of [...] "looking at my audience differently, but they also reminded me that I'm exactly where I need to be, singing to exactly the people I need to sing to." ...|$|R
6000|$|He wrung {{his hands}} in despair. [...] "It is all over!" [...] he said. [...] "The fellow has ruined us! It serves <b>me</b> right <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a fool, and {{allowing}} him {{to take control of}} everything!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{returning}} to the United States from his 2005 Australian trek, Shayman went public about his struggle with bipolar disorder. [...] "A {{lot of people who}} have suffered from similar experiences thanked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so open," [...] he said. [...] In late 2006, he launched the new Brazilian urban label Gringo Louco with Braza, a bilingual supergroup composed of three of the biggest rappers from Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|Brooks then briefly {{returned}} to Wichita, {{where she was}} raised. [...] "But {{that turned out to}} be another kind of hell," [...] she said. [...] "The citizens of Wichita either resented me having been a success or despised <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a failure. And I wasn't exactly enchanted with them. I must confess to a lifelong curse: My own failure as a social creature." [...] After an unsuccessful attempt at operating a dance studio, she returned East and, after brief stints as a radio actor and a gossip columnist, worked as a salesgirl in a Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York City for a few years, then lived as a courtesan with a few select wealthy men as clients.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2011 interview, Ellington stated that, {{among his}} friends, he is [...] "probably" [...] {{best known for}} [...] "being {{a bit of a}} lagger. I'm always late.

6000|$|... "Well, but {{you talk}} of a painful {{difference}} of opinion with your husband, and then, when I ask {{for information on the}} point, you bring out a valise. And only a few moments ago you reproached <b>me</b> <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> serious. I wonder who is the serious person of us two now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{had one of}} {{my usual}} rows with Kay, only rather worse than usual. I said one or two things he didn't like, and today the old man sent <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{and told me to}} come to his room from two till four. Kay had run <b>me</b> in <b>for</b> <b>being</b> 'grossly rude'. Listen to those kids. What a row they're making!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Wildeve looked thoughtfully at her. [...] "It {{is easier}} to say you will sing than to do it; though if I could I would {{encourage}} you in your attempt.

[...] Rio's public security chief, José Mariano Beltrame also attended the burial.|$|R
60|$|The {{three days}} {{he had me}} on board he did not depart from that half-hostile attitude. His ship having been delayed three hours on my account he couldn't forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> a more {{distinguished}} person. He was not exactly outspoken about it, but that feeling of annoyed wonder was peeping out perpetually in his talk.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a mighty}} charge against <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> author and {{publisher}} of a paper called the 'Mercator.' I will state the fact first, and then speak to the subject.|$|E

6000|$|... “No,” he said decidedly. “I don’t see why I {{should let}} the mob fine <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> honest. I’d rather fight, if I’m forced to; and I’m afraid you’ll {{have to stand}} in.” ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} I began casting about {{as to what}} I should do next. There was no longer any chance of getting at the secret from Dorothy, if secret there were.

6000|$|...
