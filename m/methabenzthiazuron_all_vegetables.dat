The <b>all</b> <b>vegetable</b> diet was formulated with corn and soybean meal as major ingredients, whereas the feed with animal by-products had inclusions of 3. 0 % pork by-product, 2. 5 % poultry by-product, and 1. 5 % feather meal.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare live performance and the yield of carcass and commercial cuts of broiler chickens fed <b>all</b> <b>vegetable</b> diets supplemented with a mix of enzymes targeting the carbohydrate fraction of soybean meal. <b>All</b> <b>vegetable</b> diets, antibiotic free, were formulated with corn and soybean meal as major ingredients. Treatments were a dietary Control without enzymes and diets composed by the supplementation to produce the other treatments with a xylanase (EC 3. 2. 1. 8), a pectinase (EC 3. 2. 1. 15) and a alpha-galactosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 22) in the amount of 100 grams per Ton each. These enzymes were included in the feeds over the top at the expense of corn individually, on a two by two basis, or the three altogether, in a total of 8 treatments. Two thousand eight hundred and eighty one-d-old Ross X Ross 308 male broiler chicks were placed in 2. 30 X 1. 75 m floor pens, 40 birds in each, 7 replicates per treatment. Results demonstrated an overall absence of response for enzyme inclusion in live performance, carcass and cuts. However, data evaluated on a weekly basis demonstrated significative differences in the period of 28 to 37 d of age for the Xylanase inclusion. No response in the most of bird responses for the three enzymes added in combination may be related to inefficacy of the enzymes in the doses included.

Vegetable {{samples were collected}} at the two stages of maturity: stage I (60 days) and stage II (90 days) for analysis. The {{results showed that the}} concentrations of heavy metals in <b>all</b> <b>vegetables</b> were greater in urban site than in periurban site. The highest concentrations of Fe (673. 92 mg/kg DW), Cu (10. 42 mg/kg), Cd (1. 70 mg/kg DW), and Pb (31. 75 mg/kg DW) were recorded in Lactuca sativa, Zn (94. 60 mg/kg DW) in Solanum nigrum, and Ni (16. 91 mg/kg DW) in Corchorus olitorius. The concentrations of Cu, and Pb were greater in roots than in aerial parts, while Fe, Cd, Ni and Zn {{concentrations were}} greater in aerial parts than in roots. Some of the concentrations of Ni, Zn and Pb in crops reached the critical level for plant growth. In general, the results indicated that the consumption of leafy vegetables harvested at the stage II potentially provides the greatest amount of heavy metals. The transportation index (Ti) decreased in vegetables harvested at the stage II for Fe, Cu, Cd and Zn but slightly increased for Ni and Pb, suggesting that heavy metal transportation from roots to aerial parts depends on the plant phenology and metal species.
