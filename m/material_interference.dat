50|$|Interference {{occurs when}} {{specific}} information inhibits learning and /or recall {{for a specific}} memory. There are two forms of interference. First, proactive interference {{has to do with}} difficulty in learning new material based on the inability to override information from older memories. In such cases, retrieval cues continue to be associated and aimed at recalling previously learned information, affecting the recall of new material. Retroactive interference is the opposite of proactive interference, in which there is difficulty in the recall of previously learned information based on the interference of newly acquired information. In this case, retrieval cues are associated with the new information and not the older memory. thus affecting recall of older <b>material.</b> <b>Interference</b> of either form can produce memory errors, in which there is interference with the recall of material. In other words, previously used retrieval cues are no longer associated with prior memories, and thus memory confusion or even an inability to recall the memory can occur.|$|E

40|$|Our {{experiments}} {{demonstrate that}} interference of an interpolated {{list of items}} with recall of an original list can be substantially reduced by forming Ss just before testing how to reorganize and simplify the interpolated material. In Experiments 1 and 2, Ss better recalled an initial serial list of letters when informed at testing that an interpolated list spelled a certain phrase backward. Similarly, in Experiments 3 and 4, Ss better recalled an initial list of cities when told that the interpolated cities were also names of former U. S. presidents. Control experiments rule out several simple explanations. In contrast to an editing hypothesis, the postorganizing clue helped recall even when problems of list differentiation were minimized. Current memory models appear unable to explain this benefit of a postlearning clue that enables Ss to segregate the interpolated material from the to-be-remembered <b>material.</b> <b>Interference</b> is a widely accepted cause of forgetting: peo-ple's recall of some material can be reduced if before or after learning it they learn similar material.

This article explains the schools 2 ̆ 7 comprehensive authority, consistent with the First Amendment, to impose discipline on cyberbullies, by suspension or expulsion if necessary. Ever since Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s First Amendment decisions have granted the schools authority to discipline student speech that causes, or reasonably threatens, (1) 2 ̆ 2 substantial disruption of or <b>material</b> <b>interference</b> with school activities 2 ̆ 2, or (2) 2 ̆ 2 collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone 2 ̆ 2.

In the Internet Age, the Court’s holdings reach cyberbullying, including messages that a student sends from off campus but foresees will have the requisite harmful effect on campus. By upholding off-campus application, lower courts remain true to advice delivered by Justice Louis D. Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States (1928). Olmstead held that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit the government from placing remote telephone wiretaps because “[t]here was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants. ” Nearly forty years later, the Court vindicated Justice Louis D. Brandeis’ Olmstead dissent from the five-Justice majority’s refusal to apply existing Fourth Amendment doctrine to technological advances wrought by the telephone. Because “[t]ime works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes,” Justice Brandeis argued, “a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. ” In Berger v. New York in 1967, the Court overruled Olmstead and acknowledged that “[t]he law... has not kept pace with... advances in scientific knowledge. ” Much as the capacity for government wiretapping of telephones from remote locations lay beyond the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment’s framers, the capacity for student cyberbullying from the Internet and other remote locations lay beyond the Supreme Court’s contemplation when it articulated and later refined Tinker’s First Amendment doctrine. Where student cyberbullies foresee that their off-campus speech will reach classmates on campus, courts remain true to Tinker and its progeny by applying their express holdings to technology that the Supreme Court had no reason to anticipate when it decided those cases...|$|E

The chromatographic separation of analytes was successfully achieved on an XTerra® MS C 18 column using a gradient elution of methanol and water containing 0. 1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min. This method demonstrated good linearity and no endogenous <b>material</b> <b>interferences.</b> The linear ranges were 1. 0 – 100 ng/mL for diazepam and 2. 0 – 200 ng/mL for dexamethasone.

In addition, we examined {{the extent to which these}} inhibitory control mechanisms are modulated by individual differences in working memory capacity. Two groups of participants with high and low working memory capacity [high span (HS) and low span (LS) participants, respectively] performed two versions of an item recognition task with familiar letters and abstract objects as stimulus <b>materials.</b> <b>Interference</b> costs were examined by means of the recent negative probe technique with otherwise identical testing conditions across both tasks. While the behavioral interference costs were of similar magnitude in both tasks, the underlying brain activation pattern differed between tasks: The object task interference-effects (higher activation in interference trials than in control trials) were restricted to the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Interference effects for familiar letters were obtained in the anterior IPS, the left postero-ventral and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as the precuneus. As the letters were more discernible than the objects, the results suggest that the critical feature for PFC and precuneus involvement in interference resolution is the saliency of stimulus-response mappings. The interference effects in the letter task were modulated by working memory capacity: LS participants showed enhanced activation for interference trials only, whereas for HS participants, who showed better performance and also lower interference costs in the letter task, the above-mentioned neuronal circuitry was activated for interference and control trials, thereby attenuating the interference effects. The latter results support the view that HS individuals allocate more attentional resources for the maintenance of task goals in the face of interfering information from preceding trials with familiar stimulus materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to observe the changes in thickness and chemical characteristics that occur in Kapton®, a type of polyimide film, when exposed to heated solvents commonly used in cleaning and processing of these <b>materials.</b> <b>Interference</b> fringes present in transmission infrared spectra were used to calculate the thickness changes of the film, and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR) was used to observe spectral shifts of the polymer film. Pieces of Kapton® film were immersed in heated solvents of n-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) resulting in a rapid initial increase of film thickness by about 2. 5 um during the first 20 minutes. After the initial increase and throughout the remainder of the 2 hour exposure, the film thickness varied little in the NMP solvent at all temperatures, 67, 95, and 125 oC. However, in DMSO, the behavior was more varied and this behavior was only observed in the 95 oC bath. The change in film thickness throughout the course of the experiment was about 1 μm less in the 125 oC as compared to the 95 oC, perhaps due to dissolution of the film by the solvent. When the film is exposed to heated solvents, a significant shift in the vibrational frequency of the asymmetric carbonyl stretch absorption to higher wavenumbers, as compared to the unexposed film, is observed. This indicates that there is some interaction between the Kapton® film and the solvent such that the strength of the carbonyl bond is lessened. Interactions could disrupt the intra- and intermolecular electron sharing and hinder the formation of the charged resonance form.
