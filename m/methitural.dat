50|$|<b>Methitural</b> (INN; Neraval, Thiogenal), or <b>methitural</b> sodium, {{also known}} as methioturiate, is a {{barbiturate}} derivative which was marketed in the 1950s in Europe (in Germany and Italy) as an ultra-short-acting intravenous anesthetic.|$|E

50|$|A {{somewhat}} more complex side chain is incorporated by alkylation of the carbanion of the substituted cyanoacetate (1) with 2-chloroethylmethyl sulfide (2). Condensation {{of the resulting}} cyanoester (3) with thiourea followed by hydrolysis of the resulting imine affords <b>methitural.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} operative {{procedure and}} anaesthetic technique {{were employed in}} a com-parison of eight intravenous barbiturates which were used as the main anaesthetic in combination with nitrous oxide and oxygen. Series were premedicated with either atropine alone or pethidine and atropine. There was little difference between the clinical effects of equipotent doses of thiopentone, thialbarbitone, thiamylal and Inactin. Hexobarbitone caused a very high incidence of muscle movements and hypotension, and was {{the worst of the}} drugs studied. Both buthalitone and <b>methitural</b> were associated with excessive- respiratory upset. Methohexitone alone showed clear advantages over standard compounds. Complete clinical recovery was quicker and there was less tendency to depress blood pressure. On reviewing the recently introduced rapidly acting barbiturates (Barron and Dundee, 1961) it became apparent that there were no reports of studies in which all the presently available drugs had been compared under standard conditions.
