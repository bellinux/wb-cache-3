The cylinder is the component in the washing machine that rotates and keeps the laundry in place. The aim of this thesis {{is to determine the}} maximum load applied to the cylinder at which crack propagation occurs. Three experiments are performed to determine the structural behavior of the cylinder. Two experiments are performed to estimate mechanical properties i. e. stress-strain relation and critical fracture energy of the stainless steel sheet in use today. This is to derive a good estimation of the maximum load the cylinder can endure. The third type of experiment is performed to determine the strains on the outer surface of the cylinder when an evenly distributed load, 11 kg, and 2200 revolution per minute are applied on the inner surface of the cylinder. Three numerical models are performed from these three types of experiments which gives an estimation of the work to be done to propagate the crack at 15 kg and 2400 rpm.

In order that the production become effective and efficient, the layout facility need to be planned very carefully. Cap Tani Vermicelli Factory is a manufacture industry in food sector. The layout which they used showed that the distance between each engines is quite separated, {{that is why they}} need a bigger space overall and high transfer cost. The layout method Corelap and Craft can be used to find out the activities between engines and also can be used to minimilize the distances between engines, which will reduce the cost of material handling. Corelap method used to find out the activity connection between related engines, where as Craft method in this case is used to minimilize the distances between engines so that the cost of Material handling become smaller. In the beginning of the layout design for group 1 (Rice <b>Washer</b> <b>Machine,</b> Dough Machine, and Press Machine) is located {{at the end of the}} layout design, the reason for this is to give distances from the finished goods warehouse to Rice <b>Washer</b> <b>Machine</b> about 40 meters. After the layout design change based on iteration suggestion number 3, the distances for group 1 is adjacent to raw material warehouse / finished goods warehouse, giving about 16, 15 meters distance between finished goods warehouse to Rice <b>Washer</b> <b>Machine.</b> Based on that, the early spacing process which is 202, 25 meters can be reduced to 173, 15 by using the iteration suggestion number 3.

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{share of}} {{electricity}} generation from renewable energy creates difficulties {{in maintaining the}} balance of generation and demand. This is mainly due to uncertainties caused by prediction errors in renewable generation. In order to maintain power system security, the participation of demand side response to the balancing services such as operating reserve is critical. In this paper, the capability of smart appliances to act as operating reserves for the system operator is investigated. The smart appliances considered are washing <b>machines,</b> dish <b>washers</b> and tumble dryers equipped with communication modules. A novel framework is introduced which enables system operators to access demand response from smart appliances in a timeframe suitable for operating reserves. A mathematical model is developed to simulate appliances with multiple discrete power phases. The delay and interruption of appliances cycles are considered in the model. A multiple time-step simulation is introduced that assesses the load reduction {{from a number of}} households as a response to a reserve instruction which is modelled as a price increase with a short notification period. The results are used to estimate the available demand response from Great Britain (GB) households at any moment of the day. With a 20 % penetration of smart appliances, the demand response can provide up to 54 % of the operating reserve requirements of the GB power system depending on the time of day...|$|R

From very crude and clumsy look in the beginning, it has transformed into a stylish, trendy looking and highly visible home appliance. Now it ranges from washing <b>machines</b> to <b>washer</b> dryers with front loading, top loading etc. Tables- 1 and II show that the growth in market demand for washing machines has expanded at an impressive rate in the early 1990 ’s owing to a low base, increase in disposable incomes, rapid urbanization, increase in nuclear families, steady transformation of urban housewife into a career woman, growth in per capita income and increase in consumerism. The market expanded by over 20 % during the first decade of the introduction of washing machines in the country and then stagnated in the new decade to record a modest annual growth rate of 9 % from 2004 - 08. The low growth in the context of low product penetration (around 6 percent) tells the true story. The writing on the wall is that it’s a dog-eat-dog market with each player eating into the other’s share. And the total pie is not growing at the rate it could. There are a variety of reasons for lukewarm sales as products that are relevant for entire family score over the washing machine.

CTV manufacturers sweeping up the demand from home appliance makers by offering exchange offers, price-offs and promotions. The activity levels are very high in television in comparison with washing machine. The reason is that the smaller business always gets short-changed in terms of resources and attention.

40|$|After some {{introductory}} remarks upon the Advanced Local Energy Planning issues, methodologies and tools developed in last years, {{the integration of}} the space variable into the analysis approach performed with some models of the MARKAL-TIMES family is discussed. Some recent applications performed by the LAME Team are discussed, where a high regionalization of the RES (MATISSE) or new spatial descriptions of the energy trade routes (REACCESS) have been performed. For a local energy planning, where a defined metropolitan area and one of its districts is involved, it is useful to develop specific GIS-integrated modelling tools able to identify (and locate) and to characterize a suitable mix of measures / intervention / technologies and infrastructures {{in the direction of a}} "smart" and sustainable society, for exploring significant mid- and long-term scenarios. The LEP-CN (Local Energy Planning for China) Model, derived from the EDPM-CN (Energy Demand Projection Model) developed in the framework of an EU-CHINA 5 -Year program (EC 2), is presented. This Model is able to assess, in a mid-long term time horizon, the energy consumptions by end-use sector on an urban district scale, by means of a simulation approach and of a geo-referenced characterization of all the buildings in the analyzed area. Construction data related to the building (Floor Area, Number of floors, Volume, Form Factor, Construction Period, Reference Building Type, and so on) and main energy related indicators (per capita Floor Area, number of persons in a single Household, per capita Income, and so on are taken into account. The main technologies adopted by each building for the fulfilment of each Service Demand (Space Heating, Space Cooling, Water Heating, Cooking, Lighting) and the number of electrical appliances (TV, Refrigerators, Washing <b>Machines,</b> Dish <b>Washers,</b> PC, and so on) for each building are also considered. The state of the connections to the district heating and to the natural and city gas networks and the identification of the connecting nodes and parameters describing the "load" of the connection (from a technical/economic point of view) are included. Furthermore, starting from the space heating demand of each building and from the geo-referenced representation of the urban networks, LEP-CN can perform, through an embedded procedure, an analysis on the district heating system; in absence of a local network, it is possible to find (under suitable user-defined constraints) the path that minimizes the total cost and reproduce it in a graphical form on map. Due to the lack of information on suitable Chinese building classifications and considering the limited availability of official and available data, up to twelve reference Building Units have been identified, related to the building dimensions (high rise, medium rise, low rise) and to the construction period, which incorporates the main energy related features. For the purpose of testing the LEP-CN approach an urban zone in Beijing has been identified, where there are low rise buildings belonging to urban villages (Hutong) as well as medium and high rise buildings. The LEP-CN approach resulted suitable for a significant set of urban energy planning exercise...|$|R
