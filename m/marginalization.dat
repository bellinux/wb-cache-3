5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and <b>marginalization.</b> Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Writing for The Escapist, Allen Varney {{felt that}} the {{political}} awareness was overstated because the percentage of The Movies films that offered social commentary remained small and because the machinima and political communities were mostly separate. He argued that machinima's outstanding copyright issues and possible <b>marginalization</b> constrained potential for expression. Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found {{his reputation as a}} writer valuable for their own interests, and preferred to try and co-opt him. In 1953, after a five-year <b>marginalization</b> for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Flemish Movement had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of <b>marginalization,</b> the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E
5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic <b>marginalization</b> has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic <b>marginalization.</b> Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marginalization</b> of the Iranian Bahá'ís {{by current}} governments {{is rooted in}} {{historical}} efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in <b>marginalization</b> of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Parsi and Marwaris Migrant {{communities}} owned {{majority of the}} industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian migrants to the city. The Shiv Sena party was established on 19 June 1966 by Bombay cartoonist Bal Thackeray, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative <b>marginalization</b> of the native Marathi people in their native state Maharashtra. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena fought for rights of native Marathis. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. During the 1970 there were Bombay-Bhiwandi riots. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and south western coast of India, after introduction of ships by the London-based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan and Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of <b>marginalization</b> combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and <b>marginalization</b> within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>marginalization</b> {{degree of}} the {{district}} was {{directly related to the}} time it took for the results to be carried to the corresponding CEDAT. Those of very low <b>marginalization</b> took an average of 4:31 hours; those of low <b>marginalization</b> an average of 6:14 hours; medium <b>marginalization</b> an average of 6:54 hours; high <b>marginalization</b> 8:45 hours; and very high <b>marginalization</b> an average of 10:32 hours. The time it took to get results from a polling place to the corresponding CEDAT was also directly related to the average distance between the polling place and the CEDAT. Almost two thirds of Calderón's votes came from districts with very low <b>marginalization,</b> arriving first, with almost three percentage points advantage over López Obrador. Moreover, it was only on those districts that Calderón obtained victories, while López Obrador was ahead mainly in districts with low, medium, and high marginalization; Madrazo only won in some districts with very high <b>marginalization.</b> Pliego Carrasco states that taking all these factors into consideration completely explains the behavior of the partial tallies, in particular the changes in the rates of growth that began occurring around 9 pm, and the further changes (outlined by the Alianza in their judicial filings) between 2 and 3 am. Pliego Carrasco criticizes Mochán and others for not considering the <b>marginalization</b> and the distance between districts and the corresponding CEDAT, and for considering only a very rough urban/rural sorting {{of the district}}s and using methods and techniques that are valid for the natural sciences and engineering but that he considers unjustified in their application to social sciences.|$|E
25|$|As a {{minority}} group within Israeli society, the Bedouin are a marginalized group. Within this culture, women {{are said to}} be marginalized twice. They are marginalized once for being a Bedouin and a second time for being a woman. <b>Marginalization</b> as a Bedouin is common to both men and women, as members of {{a minority}} group. The <b>marginalization</b> as a woman stems from traditional gender norms and expectations within Negev Bedouin society. This <b>marginalization</b> manifests itself in employment, educational, and health care outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Also known {{under her}} {{pseudonym}} Chiron Khanshendel, Wendy Rose is a poet, nonfiction writer, artist, educator, and anthropologist. As {{a blend of}} all of these things, Rose rejects <b>marginalization</b> and categorization, but she is best known for her work as an American Indian poet.|$|E
25|$|Peñamiller {{is one of}} the {{municipalities}} in the Sierra Gorda {{with high}} rates of migration to the United States, due to economic <b>marginalization.</b> This has led to a significant loss of students in the public schools, who generally accompany their parents when they move out.|$|E
25|$|The Abdallahi {{government}} was widely perceived as corrupt and restricted access to government information. Sexism, racism, female genital mutilation, child labour, human trafficking, {{and the political}} <b>marginalization</b> of largely southern-based ethnic groups continued to be problems. Homosexuality is illegal and is a capital offense in Mauritania.|$|E
25|$|Race in the United States {{is based}} on {{physical}} characteristics and skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception. Until {{the civil rights movement}} of the 1960s, racial minorities in the United States faced discrimination and social as well as economic <b>marginalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weinstein's rebellious, queer punk {{ethics and}} her podcast's {{unconventional}} content, strong, coarse language and stream-of-consciousness structure {{have made her}} an endlessly controversial icon within the more conservative podcasting community. Her show serves as an ongoing protest against censorship, the commercialization of mainstream radio and the continued <b>marginalization</b> {{of gays and lesbians}} by the growing monoculture.|$|E
25|$|The Gabboye {{occupational}} clans, {{which include}} the numerically few Madhiban, Yibir and Tumaal (collectively referred to as sab), have over the years obtained political representation within Somalia. Their general social status has correspondingly improved with the expansion of urban centers. However, due to their foreign, non-Somali origins, people from the Bantu ethnic minority group still often face societal <b>marginalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The NGOs {{report that}} {{violence}} and propaganda against the country's Shia minority continues. Shia Muslims are frequently denied services {{in addition to}} being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling Shia Muslims infidels and encourage isolation and <b>marginalization</b> of Shia Muslims in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|I {{challenge}} the prevalent <b>marginalization</b> and malignment of smooth jazz {{in the standard}} jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.|$|E
25|$|Activism {{and resentment}} {{continued}} from the 1970s to the 1990s. During this decade, the Mexican federal government adopted neoliberalism, which {{clashed with the}} leftist political ideas of liberation theology {{and many of the}} indigenous activist groups. Despite the activism, economic <b>marginalization</b> among indigenous groups remained high, with resentment strongest in the San Cristóbal region and in migrant communities living in the Lacandon Jungle.|$|E
25|$|The post-Civil War {{period was}} {{characterized}} by a precarious executive office, a lack of ideological definition, the <b>marginalization</b> of popular movements, indiscipline and the intervention of military chiefs in politics. The death of the Regent, formerly King Pedro, after successfully installing his daughter as Queen, thrust the inexperienced Maria da Glória into a role that, {{at the age of}} 15 years, she was unprepared to handle.|$|E
25|$|Slătineanu {{served as}} rector of Iași University from 1923 to 1926, {{intervening}} {{with the central}} government to prevent the <b>marginalization</b> of the Iași academic milieu.

It detailed its chronic underfunding by government, deterioration of its learning facilities, and its past appeals to private sponsors such as the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{whiteness}} has particular resonance in racially diverse countries with large majority populations of mixed European ancestry: for example, in United States (White American), the United Kingdom (White British), Brazil (White Brazilian), and South Africa (White South African). Various social constructions of whiteness have been significant to national identity, public policy, religion, population statistics, racial segregation, affirmative action, white privilege, eugenics, racial <b>marginalization</b> and racial quotas.|$|E
25|$|Taking a (what was {{becoming}} the traditional liberal) {{stance on the}} social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, {{the right to choose}} regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic <b>marginalization</b> of the poor, stating that Reagan’s reelection campaign was “a happy talk campaign,” not focused on the real issues at hand.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Chicharro {{was active}} {{setting up the}} local Castellon branch of Union Patriotica and soon became its provincial jefe. In the new partido unico he championed the Catholic-based branch and got {{increasingly}} alienated by what he perceived as <b>marginalization</b> of the Catholic groupings; other local upetistas accused him of building the local structures chiefly around his former Traditionalist supporters. The conflict climaxed in 1925, when Chicharro in protest resigned from the provincial presidency.|$|E
