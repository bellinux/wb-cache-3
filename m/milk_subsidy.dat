50|$|The Callaghan Government also {{introduced}} {{a range of}} measures aimed at moderating pressures for wage rises {{and to create a}} favourable climate “for an orderly restoration of collective bargaining.” These included the granting of family income supplements to bring the incomes of lower-paid workers up to the level of social security benefits, the lowering of marginal tax rates on smaller incomes by rises in personal allowances, and increases in children’s allowances (which were payable to the mother). However, child tax allowances were lowered, which had the effect of reducing the take home pay of fathers. The impact of consumer price rises was also mitigated by higher income limits for free school meals, an increased <b>milk</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and a substantial reduction in the duty on petrol. In addition, electricity prices were lowered for families in receipt of supplementary benefits.|$|E
40|$|Taxing sugar-sweetened {{beverages}} (SSBs) {{has been}} proposed {{as a means to}} improve U. S. diet and health and generate revenue to address obesity-related issues. A related concern is that children’s intake of SSBs, a third that of milk consumption in the late 1970 s, now equals milk consumption. Displacing milk by SSBs may shortchange the buildup of bone mass, increasing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis in later life. Accordingly, we examine the effects that a 20 - percent SSB tax and a 20 -percent milk price subsidy would have on the diet and health of American children. We estimated US beverage demand systems and used the estimated demand elasticities to examine the impacts of the hypothetical SSB tax and <b>milk</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Our results suggest that a 20 -percent tax-induced increase in soda price alone would reduce calorie intakes by 40 calories a day among children, lowering the obesity rate from 16. 1 percent to 13. 4 percent and the overweight rate from 32 percent to 26. 9 percent. When a 20 -percent price subsidy for milk is bundled with the SSB tax, children would on average decrease their calorie intake (21 calories a day) and increase their calcium intake, but the overweight and obesity rates would actually increase by around 2 percent. The seemingly contradiction between the two averages, lower calories and higher obesity, {{is due to the fact}} that the majority of children (90 percent) remain unchanged in their weight classification under the price interventions but on average reduce their calorie intake. Six percent of children increase their calorie intake and gain enough weight to cross the overweight threshold, whereas four percent of children decrease their calorie intake to improve from being overweight to healthy weight. Therefore, when averaging the effects of the price interventions, we found a decrease in calorie intake and higher overweight and obesity rates.

40|$|Reunion Island, {{situated}} in the Indian Ocean, presents a unique case study for modelling regional bio-economic parameters of the dairy industry. It {{is a good example}} of a closed system for several parameters of the model such as movement of animals, labour, consumption and available land. The existence of several agro-ecological zones from tropical to temperate, and various different types of terrain and vegetation presents another unique opportunity to study the impact of these features on the dairy industry. The present study models the dairy sector at a regional (island) level to study the impact of new or adapted agricultural policies in relation to changes in subsidy levels, price fluctuations and environmental policies (mainly nitrogen management). The model can be used to generate a number of scenarios to explore the effects of various policy measures, such as fixing the stocking rate according to EU norms, increasing or decreasing the <b>milk</b> <b>subsidy,</b> intensification (such as an increase in milk production to the allotted quota of 40 million litres/yr) and varying labour/price constraints (such as a reduction in labour hours or an increase or decrease in the milk price). The model is being utilized by the local dairy cooperative as a discussion support tool to study the implications at the regional scale of expanding the sector and assessing its economic, environmental and social impac...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} rests on two factors. First, Australian dairy farmers spend around $ 20 million annually on generic promotion and estimates of the returns from this expenditure are required to facilitate efficient investment decisions. Second, while the Australian dairy industry is currently highly regulated despite a substantial reduction in assistance over the past decade, manufacturing <b>milk</b> <b>subsidies</b> are to be eliminated by 2000 and market milk regulations are being reviewed. The profit potential of promotion may vary with the degree of regulation, so past estimates of the returns from promotion may not hold in the competitive environment of the future. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study is to examine the effects of government intervention on the profitability for dairy farmers of incremental changes in generic dairy promotion expenditure using a perfectly competitive market as a reference point. Competitive market price and quantity outcomes for the Australian dairy industry are estimated. The impacts of increments in dairy product and competing product generic promotion expenditures on dairy farmers' profits are assessed using equilibrium displacement modelling. Finally, graphical procedures are used to examine the effects of dairy industry regulation on the profitability of dairy promotion. generic promotion, dairy, equilibrium displacement modelling, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: According to the {{available}} evidence, consumption {{of milk and}} other dairy products among Iranians is far less than recommendations. The share of different milks (i. e., traditionally vs. industrially processed) and its associated variables are, however, neither consistent nor fully known in different Provinces. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} determine household milk consumption and its association with selected socio-demographic factors in West Azarbayejan Province, North-west Iran. A total of 650 households were selected from urban and rural areas in three major Azeri and Kurdish districts (i. e. Urmia, Khoy and Mahabad) using a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Data were collected using socio-economic and milk frequency questionnaires. Results: The findings indicated that traditionally-processed milk (bulk) was the most common milk consumed at household level (62. 5 %). Mean of bulk milk consumption in urban and rural areas was 479 ± 23 and 730 ± 64 ml/wk per capita, respectively. It was also shown that establishment of the new food subsidization policy has decreased the mean of household milk consumption by approximately 3 l/wk in urban areas. Factor analysis detected a significant decrease in the higher tertiles of family size/ethnicity score consumption of both bulk and pasteurized milk, which resulted in decreased consumption of total milk. Conclusions: Designing and implementation of alternative approaches, such as targeted <b>milk</b> <b>subsidies</b> for poor households or vulnerable age-groups should be considered.

For 35 years until retiring in January 1982, Olin worked in General Electric (GE) as corporate {{vice president and general}} manager of industrial electronics. Olin's job at GE took place in Schenectady, Erie, Pennsylvania, and Salem, Virginia. In 1982, Olin was elected to represent the 6th district of Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives. While in the House, Olin was considered to be a moderate member of the state's delegation. For example, in 1991, he opposed the Persian Gulf War. In 1990, he was one of the only three Democrats in the House to vote against Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. That same year, he clashed with President George H. W.

Cilj mu je saniranje najtežih socijalnih problema. On obuhvaća stare i nove mjere socijalne zaštite najugroženijeg stanovništva. Prema rezultatima s kraja studenog 1993. godine pomoć iz Socijalnog programa dobilo je 241 tisuća građana Hrvatske, a potrošeno je 115 mln DEM. Socijalni program ima privremeni karakter i služi za prevladavanje kritične faze u razvoju Hrvatske, uzrokovane velikosrpskom agresijom, te problemima prelaza iz socijalističkog u demokratsko društvo. Because the Greater-Serbia-aggression, the Republic of Croatia {{has found}} itself in a very {{difficult}} situation after having gained its independence. One fourth of its territory is occupied, many settlements and industrial plants are destroyed, and some very important branches of economy, like tourism for example, have been blocked due to the cut off communications among different parts of the country. Croatia has been compelled to accommodate a large number of displaced people, refugees and other war victims. The result of all this is a significant decrease of the living standards of the citizens of Croatia. The average monthly salary today amounts to about DM 200. apart from displaced people and refugees, the most affected are the categories of citizens that even before the war used to live with difficulty: the unemployed, the retired and the low income citizens. In order to protect the most severely threatened citizens, the Government of Croatia adopted on March 11, 1993 the Social Programme and then some amendments to the same Programme on August 24, 1993. The Social Programme covers some previously existing protection measures for the poor but it has also included some new ones like the housing costs allowances, assistance in the form of food, clothing and footwear, bread and <b>milk</b> <b>subsidies,</b> free school-books for poor children and firewood supply assistance. Citizens who have been assisted by the government receive a social card on which each assistance is recorded. By the end of November 1993, the social card was given to 105. 107 families with 241. 091 members. This Programme does not cover displaced people, refugees and other war victims that are given separate attention. In {{the first nine months of}} the application of the Social Programme, 115 million DM have been spent. The Social Programme is an instrument of a defensive social policy. Its goal is to overcome the most difficult social problems during the critical period that the Republic of Croatia is undergoing. Its makers are aware of the fact that only the settlement of the existing conditions, an economic development and new employments can solve these crucial economic and social problems of Croatia...|$|R
40|$|School milk {{consumption}} {{has declined}} steadily in Germany. A research project {{was set up}} to retrieve quantifiable information on the different factors of influence and to develop solutions to improve the school milk consumption [...] The main goal is to evaluate the impact of price, product range, distribution form, information campaigns, regional situation, county based social index, socially-funded school milk distribution, and gender shares, as well as the immigration background share within a class. A total of 400 primary schools were selected by stratified random sampling. Surveys for principals and school milk managers were used to gain information on distribution problems throughout the milk chain, on the handling, and their attitudes towards school milk and milk in general. The price of school milk is being reduced stepwise in the 2008 / 09 school year. The quantity of consumption is reported per class. A multilevel analysis is applied to determine the factors driving consumption at the class level. First results will be validated. The paper comprises an extended introduction, followed by the research approach. A descriptive analysis is given following {{a detailed description of the}} experiment [...] The estimation procedure is discussed before the results are presented. Finally, a qualification of outcomes and conclusions concerning further research are found.

40|$|Given {{the recent}} {{steadily}} declining consumption of school milk in Germany, {{a research project}} {{was set up by}} the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, in affiliation with other institutions, to retrieve quantifiable information on the different influencing factors and to provide approaches for improving the school milk demand. Main objectives are to evaluate impacts of factors like price, attitudes and habits (especially consumption habits), social background, gender, economic situation, knowledge, product range and distribution form, as well as of nutritional education measures. Primary schools in North Rhine Westphalia were selected by stratified random sampling. Price impacts are derived by an experiment in which the price of school milk was reduced stepwise during the school year 2008 / 09, and increased over the school year 2009 / 10, while quantities of demand were reported regularly – either for individuals or on class level - for the selected schools. Almost all other information/data is captured by questionnaires given to pupils, parents, class teachers, school principals, school milk managers, and delivery firms. Preliminary results of a multilevel analysis based on a subset of already available data indicate that the demand on the class level is influenced by girls’ share, migrants’ share, class year, class size, attitude of school principal, municipal size, and last but not least the price. school <b>milk,</b> demand <b>subsidy,</b> price experiment, multilevel analysis, Agricultural and Food Policy, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, Health Economics and Policy, C 02,...|$|R
30|$|The {{stabilisation}} of {{headage payment}} rights after 1992, both at national and individual levels, brought {{instability in the}} sector since farmers opted to increase their flocks in order to press for higher quotas and to benefit from high <b>milk</b> prices. Crop <b>subsidies</b> further affected most sheep and goat farming systems since prices decreased also for concentrate feeds, thus leading farmers to utilise them more in feeding their flocks. Then, Greece consolidated, by the Reg. (E.E.C) 1107 / 96, as Products of Designated Origin [PDO] 20 dairy-farming products (cheeses) of which 18 were made of sheep and goat milk. At that point, a 'milk war' broke out as large dairy enterprises competed in offering high prices for sheep and goat milk, as each aimed to secure a bigger market share in the sector. Nevertheless, overproduction of milk and higher final product prices soon resulted in an over-supply of cheese, so milk prices fell sharply in the subsequent years, gradually returning to the former levels by 2000. A stable period in production and product prices followed until 2005.|$|R
40|$|The MILC program, a {{counter-cyclical}} {{income support}} program, {{was designed to}} provide price support to dairy farmers. Since {{the inception of the}} MILC program {{it has been argued that}} the program is inefficient and rewards inefficiency by keeping high cost, small dairy farms in business. Large dairy producers have expressed concerns that the MILC payments have negatively affected their farming income. Using farm-level, ARMS data from 2005, this study investigated the factors that affect farmer’s decision to participate in MILC program and if participation in MILC has an impact on milk production. The results show that participation in MILC program is positively correlated with farmer’s educational attainment, organic certification <b>subsidy,</b> <b>milk</b> price, off-farm work by spouses, and financial record keeping. Further, medium sized dairy farms are more likely to participate in MILC program. Finally, results indicate that participation in MILC program has a positive impact on milk production. dairy farms, agricultural policy, Milk Income Loss Contract Program, two-step probit estimation, Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries, H 20, Q 13, Q 18,...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{determinants of}} growth among German dairy farms between 1997 und 2005 under the EU milk quota system. Higher milk yield per cow, more family labour, and higher milk prices increase {{the growth rate}} of growing farms, ceteris paribus. Older growing farmers tend to grow at lower rates. In line with Weiss’ findings (1999) for Austrian farms, Gibrat’s Law of relative firm growth being independent of initial firm size does not hold for our subsample of farms growing in milk production, either: the growth rate is quite high for small farms and has a minimum for farms around 325, 000 kg of initial quota. For the 16 % of growing farms that have more initial quota the growth rate increases up to some out-of-sample maximum. We corrected for selection bias by means of a multinomial logit model which explains the choice among different growth regimes in more detail than the well-known Heckman procedure. In our case, e. g. age impacts the choice between growth and stagnation but not between growth and exiting from <b>milk</b> production; crop <b>subsidies</b> only influence the decision between growth and exiting from milk production but not the decision between growth and decline or stagnation.
