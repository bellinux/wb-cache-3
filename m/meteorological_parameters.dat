Satellites cannot determine the interior barometric pressure of a hurricane, nor provide accurate wind speed information. These data are needed to accurately predict hurricane development and movement. Because satellites cannot collect the data and ships are too slow and vulnerable, the only viable way to collect this information is with aircraft.

40|$|The global solar {{radiation}} is an important <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> for understanding the biochemical processes in the environment. Their measurement is complex and requires a high cost of installation, operation and maintenance, but this can be estimated by empirical equations based primarily on their geolocation. However, {{the accuracy of the}} results obtained is not suitable for understanding the processes evaluated. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a statistical correlation model for estimating global {{solar radiation}} from alternative <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter.</b> The <b>meteorological</b> information was provided by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia, which provided the measurement of solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity and sunshine of the day for a year. Simple regressions between variables and solar radiation were raised; and multiple regressions between the possible combinations of each variables and solar radiation. The results show a good statistical correlation between variables solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity and little relation to the hours of sunshine, where relative humidity has the higher correlation and therefore is the parameter that more influence has on the model. The multivariate models (R 2 average 11. 91 %) have better fit than simple models (R 2 average 5. 66 %). The best model is multivariate regression in which all variables were included (R 2 of 13. 75 %) although not the simplest model estimation...|$|R

The consequences of continuous variation in meteorological condition were severe reduction and deterioration in annual tonnage of rice yield and environmental resource sustainability.

40|$|Regional drought {{assessment}} is conventionally based on drought indices for {{the identification of}} drought intensity, duration and areal extent. In this study, a new index, the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) is proposed together with the well known Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the method of deciles. The new index exhibits significant advantages over the other indices by including apart from precipitation, an additional <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter,</b> the potential evapotranspiration. The drought {{assessment is}} achieved using the above indices in two river basins, namely Mornos and Nestos basins in Greece. It is concluded that although the RDI generally responds {{in a similar fashion}} to the SPI (and to a lesser extent to the deciles), it is more sensitive and suitable in cases of a changing environment. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006...|$|R
