5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk when <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> on the ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, {{particularly when}} roosting {{in the middle}} of the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E

5|$|Bloody Fun Day is {{a puzzle}} Flash game {{developed}} by Urban Squall {{and published by}} Kongregate on March 12, 2009. Players control one {{of a family of}} three grim reapers and are tasked with <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors. Only the red ones restore life; the others charge special abilities that give the player more ways to kill further Cuties.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} hurricane {{status for}} twelve hours before decelerating {{to the north}} and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing vertical shear, Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30°N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h) while located 650mi (1,050km) east of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|On March 15, the US Navy {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather, that had developed about 245km (150mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. During that day the depression moved towards the southeast and gradually developed further while <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the south coast of Viti Levu. During the next day, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the area of disturbed weather and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 18P, with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 55km/h (35mph). During the following day as the depression did not intensify any further as it continued to move towards the southeast. The NPMOC then issued their final advisory on the system later that day, as the depression dissipated about 960km (600mi) to the southeast of Nuku'alofa, Tonga.|$|E

5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the periphery of a high pressure system over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) on October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm. It became an extratropical cyclone, occluding near the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Turkish forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> to the north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E
5|$|Dewes and Len Hutton {{opened for}} England, {{a move that}} {{attracted}} criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and Keith Miller. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second ball of the day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when Sam Loxton fired in a wide return, but Sid Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced {{the start of the}} second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the Victory Tests in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for Cambridge University against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used towels to pad his torso against Miller's short balls. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on <b>moving</b> <b>around,</b> unable to stand still.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} matches, {{although}} there were instances of the English bowlers pitching the ball short and causing problems with their pace, full bodyline tactics were not used. There had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. The English tactics changed {{in a game against}} an Australian XI team at Melbourne in mid-November, when full bodyline tactics were deployed for the first time. Jardine had left himself out of the English side, which was led instead by Bob Wyatt who later wrote that the team experimented with a diluted form of bodyline bowling. He reported to Jardine that Bradman, who was playing for the opposition, seemed uncomfortable against the bowling tactics of Larwood, Voce and Bowes. The crowd, press and Australian players were shocked by what they experienced and believed that the bowlers were targeting the batsmen's heads. Bradman adopted unorthodox tactics—ducking, weaving and <b>moving</b> <b>around</b> the crease—which did not meet with universal approval from Australians and he just 36 and 13 in the match.|$|E
