5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting that they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to help control rodent populations.|$|E
2500|$|An Associated Press {{article in}} March 2014 stated that [...] "more than 70 {{percent of whom}} {{identify}} themselves as Catholic" [...] but provided no source for this information. (It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the 2010 Pew Research Center data.) ...|$|R
25|$|West Coast coach Ken Judge {{was told}} by a Perth detective in 2001 that Cousins {{and two of his}} {{teammates}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> illegal drugs. Judge passed this information on to the club's administration but no action was taken.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{suggested}} that Landis <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> testosterone {{over the long}} term but either masking it or diluting it to avoid detection. The positive test result would therefore <b>have</b> <b>been</b> from a mistake with the alleged doping program on one day.|$|R
5|$|Various {{plants are}} said to have apotropaic qualities, notably Mountain Ash. Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a {{hallucinogen}} as long ago as the Neolithic period. This tradition has recently been taken up once again by New Agers.|$|E
5|$|CharlesII, {{unmarried}} when he {{took the}} throne, persuaded his Treasury to pay for a christening font and basin. His marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, but the font <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children. It was last used in 1796, while the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19thcentury and is on display with the altar plate at the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 200's, Origen of Alexandria <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the same 27 books {{as in the}} modern New Testament, though there were still {{disputes}} over the canonicity of Hebrews, James, II Peter, II John and III John, and Revelation, {{referred to as the}} Antilegomena.|$|R
50|$|Daisy Nook hosts {{an annual}} Easter Fair along Stannybrook Road - {{depicted}} rather quaintly by Lowry {{in one of}} his paintings. The fair today isn't quite so tasteful or Lowry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> some artistic licence.. either way it's an annual tradition and a bit of fun.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, Tehran's mayor Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf {{seized on}} the issue, instructing {{municipal}} lawyers to begin legal action to force Britain to forfeit its legal title to Gholhak. Observers suspected that the mayor <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the Gholhak dispute to boost his conservative credentials and profile prior to the 2013 Iranian presidential elections.|$|R
5|$|Hengistbury Head {{is home to}} {{a plethora}} of nationally and internationally {{significant}} archaeological sites, with features dating from the Late Upper Palaeolithic to the Roman settlement of Britain, earning the site Scheduled Ancient Monument status. Interest in the site declined throughout the Dark Ages, until extensive development took place in Christchurch around 890 AD, when the Head <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a lookout post. The area was heavily quarried during the Victorian period and nowadays receives over a million visitors annually.|$|E
5|$|Locus 011 and Locus 057 {{may have}} been watchposts, they were {{situated}} at the points where the Quiriguá and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus057 was situated {{on one of the}} most probable routes to Copán and {{may have been}} a watchpost to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch, an {{earthwork}} {{stretching from}} Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, {{is evidence of}} Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from Old English such as -tun, meaning farmstead, and leah meaning clearing.|$|E
50|$|He {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dead by 1130, when {{another member of}} the Mac Duib kindred, the Gille Míchéil who {{appeared}} alongside Causantín in the charter of 1126, is ruling as mormaer; although the latter <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the title comes (mormaer) as early as 1126, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the style Mac Duib since at least 1126. Donnchad I, who succeeded Gille Mícheil, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Causantín's son.|$|R

2500|$|The group's first {{recorded}} attack was against Fox.com's website, though they still <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> the name Internet Feds at the time. It {{claimed responsibility for}} leaking information, including passwords, altering several employees' LinkedIn profiles, and leaking a database of X Factor contestants containing contact information of 73,000 contestants. They claimed to do so because the rapper Common <b>had</b> <b>been</b> referred to as [...] "vile" [...] on air.|$|R
5|$|No {{music that}} can be {{definitively}} traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some of it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline {{and some of the}} same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 (or Structure IV) is a {{group of}} three temples {{on the east side of}} the Central Plaza. It is divided into three sections, {{labelled}} Structures 4a, 4b and 4c. The central Structure 4b is built upon a substructure dating to the Preclassic period. Together with Structure 6 on the opposite side of the plaza, these buildings form an E-Group that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to determine the solstices and the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought {{to have come from}} the Isle of Arran.|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} for mobile agents is access to non-mobile {{resources}}. When an agent moves from one host to another, {{resources such as}} sockets and files that the agent <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> on the source host are not available to the agent on the destination host. This complicates {{the task of the}} agent designer since the designer has to make sure that access to all non-mobile resource...|$|R

50|$|New {{findings}} {{published in}} the Journal Plos One on July 16, 2013 further evidence head-butting in species of pachycephalosaurs. Of the 100 domes studied, 20 percent showed signs of healed injuries, all consistent with combative behavior. The pathologies included pitting where the bone had become infected from wounds that originated in the skin. These findings further imply that pachycephalosaurids <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> their heads for both display and defense as many modern animals do.|$|R
5|$|The cathedral is a GradeI listed building, {{and part}} of a {{heritage}} site that also includes the former monastic buildings to the north, which are also listed GradeI. The cathedral, typical of English cathedrals in having been modified many times, dates from between 1093 and the early 16thcentury, although the site itself <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for Christian worship since Roman times. All the major styles of English medieval architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular, are represented in the present building.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, {{in the preparation of}} leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E
5|$|This smaller room <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> by Henry and Thomas Lyte {{for their}} studies. It too has later {{paneling}} and an alcove in which are displayed {{a collection of}} early glassware. Above this room is the Little Chamber, used by Sir Walter Jenner as his bedroom. The bed came from Burton Pynsent House in Somerset, a house given to William Pitt the Elder by an admirer of his achievements as prime minister.|$|E
50|$|The camp <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>used</b> by hunters during hunting season. During {{the seventies}} and eighties, the {{property}} caretaker was Hubert Holmes.|$|R
50|$|As-Nas cards <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> {{for other}} games. Murdoch Smith {{writes that the}} 'game {{somewhat}} resembles Lansquenet', which is a much simpler gambling game.|$|R
50|$|The Proto-Australoid tribe {{known as}} the Konkas, from whom is derived {{the name of the}} region, Kongvan or Konkan, with the other {{mentioned}} tribes, reportedly made up the earliest settlers in the territory. Agriculture had not fully developed at this stage and was being developed. The Kol and Mundari <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> stone and wood implements, as iron implements <b>were</b> <b>used</b> by the megalithic tribes as late as 1200 BC. The Kol tribe <b>is</b> believed to <b>have</b> migrated from Gujarat.|$|R
5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> {{in the construction of}} the canopy of the bed.|$|E
2500|$|Investigators {{have not}} said {{whether they have}} had the {{handwriting}} analyzed. The website Crime Watch Daily had an expert, Peggy Walla, look at photos of the note. She noted that it was clean of the blood reportedly found splattered all over the room, suggesting it was written either away {{from the crime scene}} or beforehand. The writer <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>using</b> their non-dominant hand in an attempt to disguise their handwriting. Walla believes the writer was particularly agitated, likely to the point of homicidal rage, by being called [...] "stupid".|$|R
