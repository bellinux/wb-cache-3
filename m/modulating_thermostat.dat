5000|$|The <b>modulating</b> <b>thermostat,</b> also {{referred}} to as the throttling thermostat, is the most basic thermostat control offered in the commercial griddle market and is typically found in lower priced griddles where some control is necessary but performance is not critical. It offers the advantage of being a mechanical system that doesn’t require electric power, which simplifies design and reduces overall unit cost. In this particular style of control the fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature and slowly actuates an internal diaphragm which controls gas flow to the burner. One drawback to this control is long response time, which causes the overall control to overshoot and undershoot the temperature target by as much as 40°F (22°C). For example, at a set point of , the griddle surface temperature over the probe can range from [...]|$|E

Ultimately, the pressure relief valve opens, and excess fluid is dumped into an overflow container. Fluid overflow ceases when the <b>thermostat</b> <b>modulates</b> the rate of cooling to keep {{the temperature of the}} coolant at optimum. When the engine coolant cools and contracts (as conditions change or when the engine is switched off), the fluid is returned to the radiator through additional valving in the cap.|$|R

The local pneumatic <b>thermostats</b> <b>modulate</b> the dampers of VAV boxes to maintain room temperature at their setpoints. The thermostat action is switched from direct acting (DA) to reverse acting (RA) {{when the season}} changes from fall to winter and vice versa from winter to spring, based on the out side air temperature, when season changes. This results {{in various parts of}} the building ether too cold or too hot during the season change. This paper presents that the thermostat action will be switched according to cooling loads or discharge air temperature, instead of outside air temperature. For the interior zone, thermostat action does not need to be switched at all. The comfort is improved and savings is achieved by the new control scheme. Because some air-handling units (AHUs) serve both interior and exterior zones, this system never worked as intended. The system must be modified to have zone reheat and the AHUs discharge air temperature is set below dew point for humidity control...|$|R
