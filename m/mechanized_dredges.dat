40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the composition, structure and {{damage caused by}} <b>mechanized</b> <b>dredges</b> on discarded species from the wedge clam (Donax trunculus Linnaeus 1758) fisheries in the Alboran Sea. Discard samples were collected on board artisanal fishing vessels in 95 commercial hauls performed in Fuengirola and Caleta de Vélez between March 2013 and March 2014. The collected fauna was characterized according to their abundance and biomass, and considering their damage type by using a three-level scale (no damage, intermediate damage and severe damage) defined for the different faunal groups identified. Data was analysed for contrasting variations in the different areas and seasons. A total of 87 species were identified, including Paguridae and Annelida. Molluscs were the best represented faunal group, followed by decapod crustaceans and echinoderms. Other groups did not usually exceed 1 % of the total abundance and biomass such as fishes or sipunculids. Most discarded individuals displayed no damage after their capture, promoting therefore a high survival rate. Among the dominant taxa, echinoderms and crustaceans displayed the highest proportion of damaged individuals due to their fragile exoesqueletons, which make them to be highly vulnerable to the physical impact caused by <b>mechanized</b> <b>dredges</b> and the further processing on board.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the composition and}} structure of discards of the stripped venus clam (Chamelea gallina) fishery, and {{the damage caused by}} <b>mechanized</b> <b>dredges</b> on discarded species in the Alboran Sea. A total of 106 commercial fishing hauls have been analyzed between March 2013 and March 2014. Samples were collected on board artisanal fishing vessels based in Fuengirola and Caleta de Vélez harbours (Málaga). The collected fauna was characterized considering the damage presented by using a three level scale: no damage, intermediate damage and severe damage. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed with multivariate methods for contrasting seasonal variability. A total of 98 species were identified, with molluscs being the best-represented taxa (e. g. Acanthocardia tuberculata, Mactra stultorum), followed by decapod crustaceans (e. g. Portumnus latipes, Liocarcinus vernalis) and echinoderms (e. g. Echinocardium cf. mediterraneum, Ophiura ophiura). Most individuals displayed no damage after their capture. Echinoderms displayed the highest proportion of damaged individuals, followed by mollucs and decapod crustaceans. The discard structure and damage on non-target species displayed significant seasonal differences, with the higher proportions of damaged individuals in winter. Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|The starfish Luidia atlantidea, an {{echinoderm}} known hitherto from infralittoral and circalittoral {{bottoms of}} the northwestern African coasts, is {{reported for the}} first time in the European margin and in the Mediterranean Sea. A total of 31 specimens of different sizes (disc diameters from 0. 8 to 2. 9 cm) were collected from the <b>mechanized</b> <b>dredges</b> fleet targeting four commercial bivalves (Acanthocardia tuberculata, Callista chione, Chamelea gallina, Donax trunculus) between February and July 2013 in the northern Alboran Sea (southern Spain). Most individuals had broken arms due to the collecting gear. The specimens were generally collected in low numbers, at shallower depths (1 - 11 m) than the bathymetric range reported for this species along the northwestern African coasts (10 - 80 m). The data provided here, and supported by old specimens collected between 1980 - 1990, suggests that local populations of L. atlantidea occur in shallow infralittoral soft bottoms of the northern Alboran Sea. This constitutes a new extended northeastern limit for the distribution of L. atlantidea and increases the known number of Luidia species in the Mediterranean Sea. Postprint 0, 708...|$|E
