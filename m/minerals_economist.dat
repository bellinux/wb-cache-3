40|$|Mr. Ellis {{has almost}} 30 years of mining {{industry}} {{experience as a}} geologist and <b>minerals</b> <b>economist.</b> He is the U. S. representative on the Extractive Industries Task Force of the International Valuation Standards Committee. Rapid implementation of the International Accounting Standards (IAS) for public financial reporting is taking place globally. European companies are required to convert to IAS by 2005. The author expects substantial acceptance of IAS in the U. S. and Canada by near that date. IAS provides for the current value of assets to be reported in the primary financial reports of companies. In November 2000, the Extractive Industries Steering Committee of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) released an Issues Paper seeking replies by 30 June 2001. Based on the responses received, the committee is scheduled to develop an accounting standard for the mining and petroleum industries for release {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2002 as part of IAS. The tentative views expressed by the IASC steering committee have a deja vu resemblance to the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commision’sperspective expressed in its highly restrictive and antiquated Industry Guide 7. The question of whether to allow quantitative reporting of resources that are not reserves, as supplemental information, appears to have only barely remained on the edge of the table for discussion. The possibility of reporting an estimate of the current value of any category of such resources did not even reach the table. Disclosure of the current value of reserves would be restricted to a supplemental information section. If the standard is finalized with this perspective, the restriction to an historic cost accounting basis for reserves and resources will greatly handicap the financial abilities of the mining and petroleum industries relative to other industries allowed current value accounting of assets...|$|E
40|$|The area of {{changing}} international mineral competitiveness has attracted growing attention among <b>mineral</b> <b>economists.</b> The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to examine the competitiveness of the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC) using porter analysis. A questionnaire survey was undertaken with JPMC experts and findings showed that JPMC has a favorable advantage on the bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitutes and threat of local entry. However, it doesn’t have a favorable advantage on the bargaining power of buyers, rivalry among competitors and threat of global entry. Depending on the literature and the questionnaire findings, a number of strategies were recommended to JPMC, which can also be adopted by the companies in other developing countries. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} of papers {{presented in this}} Special Issue is grouped under the broad theme, “Rare Earth Elements: The role of geology, exploration, and analytical geochemistry in ensuring diverse sources of supply and a globally sustainable resource”. The Special Issue {{is intended to be}} an international venue for geologists, geochemists, and <b>mineral</b> <b>economists</b> to present new research with a focus on promising exploration approaches and unconventional resources of the rare earth elements (REE). The volume includes applications of geochemical analysis to develop novel approaches to deposit exploration and mine-site characterization, to understand the occurrence and genesis of REE in unconventional deposit types, and to evaluate the distribution of these elements in the surface environments in media including sediment, soils, biota, and water...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. (Mineral Economics) This work is {{an attempt}} to {{discover}} whether or not South Africa's gold reserves have been properly exploited - has the wealth that has been removed been used to the best advantage. It became apparent to the author whilst conducting feasibility studies on both projected and operating mines that scant attention is paid to the determination of an optimal time path of depletion for a mineral deposit by the planners. The main, if not sole, criterion is the maximising of returns on the capital invested. The thesis proposes a methodology to describe the actual depletion paths achieved by a selection of South African gold mines. The work of <b>mineral</b> <b>economists,</b> especially Harold Hotelling, is used to provide a theoretical base for the. proposals. The mines were selected to cover as wide a range of the exploitation cycle as possible from the planning stage to final abandonment...|$|R
5000|$|Kosovo {{has several}} {{industry}} sectors, {{as the most}} developed ones are: Ferrous and Non-Ferrous, Metallurgy and Mining. In northern Kosovo, {{near the town of}} Mitrovica, sits a huge dilapidated industrial site known as the Trepca mining complex. During the 1980s, it employed 20,000 workers and accounted for 70 percent of all Yugoslavia's <b>mineral</b> wealth. One <b>economist</b> described Trepca as a [...] "colossal conglomerate composed of more than forty mines, foundries, and subsidiary plants - which its height generated 25 percent of the entire regional industrial production and figured among the principal exporters of the ex-Yugoslavia.' According to the same study, 'In the subsoil of Kosovo, one of the richest of Europe, enormous deposits are hidden of lignite, lead, zinc, non-ferric metals, gold, silver and petroleum," [...] on top of 17 billion tons of coal.|$|R
