500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day and told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to build a studio," [...] {{she said in an}} interview with the Daily Mail. [...] "The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye-opener for me. It inspired me to dig out my old Marvin Gaye albums and start writing songs." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Hornsby, {{who played}} with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967–1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] {{inspired}} Allman to take up slide guitar. [...] After hearing Beck's record, Allman [...] "loved that slide part and told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to learn to play}} it", Hornsby recalled. [...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song. [...] Titled [...] "The Bomber", the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel's Boléro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album. [...] Several artists have recorded renditions of [...] "Beck's Bolero", including SRC, the Posies, Les Fradkin, Eric Johnson, and Return to Forever.|$|E
500|$|Boulding was {{tracked by}} Bradford City and Crewe Alexandra, {{with whom he}} was offered a {{contract}} after a successful trial, but instead decided to retire from professional football after being asked {{to play on the}} left wing. Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to retire because he didn't want to sit on the bench all season—or drop down the divisions." [...] His retirement lasted seven months while he worked for his father's company until he joined Rotherham United in March 2006 following three reserve games. He signed {{for the rest of the}} 2005–06 season, but did not make any first-team appearances for Rotherham and left the club at the end of the season.|$|E

"So Wainwright boils {{some more}} with indignation at the {{insensibility}} {{of people who}} are not corpulent to fill public positions; and then <b>he</b> tells <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> out to the president's summer palace, which is four miles from Aguas Frescas, to instruct him in the art of running steam-heated republics.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Moffat {{has turned}} up again. We all thought you had finally {{extinguished}} him. He left a card the other day, and I have told the servant always to say that I am at home, and that you <b>are</b> with <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to stand for some borough in the west of Ireland. He's used to shillelaghs by this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two of our ponies {{are about}} used up," [...] said the manager, [...] "and we've {{got to leave}} them somewhere. Ben tells <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to see your Uncle Dan'l this noon, so suppose you take one of these boys and ride {{them up to the}} pasture. Ben will make a bargain with your uncle for their keeping, and you can use them in your circus if you want to." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Of course not,' {{said the}} Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> a journey, I should say [...] "With what porpoise?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's polite," [...] {{said the}} girl, indignantly. [...] "After giving you your clothes, too. What {{do you think}} my uncle will say to <b>me?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to keep you here till Friday." ...|$|E
60|$|As I shook old Harût's hand in {{farewell}} <b>he</b> told <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on to Egypt, and I {{asked him}} why.|$|R

6000|$|... "They may {{conclude}} it isn't best {{to tackle}} <b>me,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to take a}} hand," [...] he thought, and at this moment Chunky returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Bailey {{did call}} on you this afternoon? He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to, but I {{hoped he would}} think better of it. But {{apparently}} there are no limits to Bailey's stupidity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{came this}} way," [...] she went on. [...] "I {{appointed}} the time myself yesterday, but Captain Anthony {{would not have}} minded. He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to look over some business papers till I came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{heard the}} shots," [...] said Mary almost brightly; [...] "but I was busy packing just then. And Innocent had told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to shoot at}} Dr. Warner; so it wasn't worth while to come down." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Still, you see, it doesn’t matter {{quite so}} much in his case. He leaves nobody {{to worry about it}} behind him, and had no prospects. He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> out to try his fortune in another land, anyway.” ...|$|E
60|$|When Arthur {{came to see}} me one {{day last}} July and told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry the most {{wonderful}} girl in the world, of course I thought good-bye. A man thinks he can keep his bachelor friendships, but he never does.|$|E
6000|$|Seating herself [...] "for ten minutes," [...] she said: [...] "By the way, Mr. Denham told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to give up}} the Bar {{and live}} in the country. Has he gone? He was {{beginning}} to tell me about it, when we were interrupted." ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Don't put it like that, mother. Of course I {{am sorry}} to leave you. Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.

6000|$|... "I mean {{to try it}} on all the same. There's Smiler about town as bold as brass, {{and dressed}} to the nines. He had the cheek to tell <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down to the Newmarket Spring to look after a horse he's got a share in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip!" [...] she cried. [...] "Why, you are wonderful! You are marvellous! You make me ashamed. It {{was only}} for a moment that I lost my nerve, and you saved us.

6000|$|... "He's {{not going}} {{straight}} at things," [...] said Durgan the bottle-washer to his wife. [...] "He usually goes so straight at things it's {{a pleasure to}} watch it.

[...] "He hasn't...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was, doctor. My uncle told <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to dine with him, and Dr. Pearson {{mentioned}} to <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{next to the}} General and caught him as he fell from his chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} written you a line, Bransome," [...] he said, as they shook hands. [...] "The chief tells <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to honor us down at Devenham {{for a few}} days, and that we may expect you also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of him and once I saw him, a few moons ago passing through Pinetown. A Kaffir with him told <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> over the Drakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly, being quite mad, Baas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, Macalister," [...] Captain Lister replied, as he {{reined in}} the horse at Frank's door.

6000|$|... "I'm {{up a tree}} there, too. All I know <b>is</b> that <b>he</b> {{took her}} sleigh-riding one {{afternoon}} at the capital, and wouldn't tell <b>me</b> who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to take. And then she fell off her horse down at East Tunbridge Station--" ...|$|R
