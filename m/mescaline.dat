5|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as <b>mescaline</b> and DOM.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti {{have been shown to}} contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species {{have a long history of}} use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America. Both contain <b>mescaline.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, <b>mescaline,</b> and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, <b>mescaline,</b> psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, <b>mescaline,</b> and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E
25|$|About {{half the}} initial dosage is {{excreted}} after 6 hours, but {{some studies suggest}} that it is not metabolized at all before excretion. <b>Mescaline</b> appears to not be subject to metabolism by CYP2D6 and between 20% and 50% of <b>mescaline</b> is excreted in the urine unchanged, and the rest being excreted as the carboxylic acid form of <b>mescaline,</b> a likely result of MAO degradation. The LD50 of <b>mescaline</b> has been measured in various animals: 212mg/kg i.p. (mice), 132mg/kg i.p. (rats), and 328mg/kg i.p. (guinea pigs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> is biosynthesized from {{tyrosine}} or a hydroxylated phenylalanine. In Lophophora williamsii (Peyote), dopamine converts into <b>mescaline</b> in a biosynthetic pathway involving m-O-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|Psychopharmacologist Arthur Heffter {{isolated}} <b>mescaline</b> {{from the}} peyote cactus in 1897 and conducted experiments {{on its effects}} by comparing the effects of peyote and <b>mescaline</b> on himself.|$|E
25|$|The sex {{psychologist}} Havelock Ellis {{also tried}} <b>mescaline.</b>|$|E
25|$|George Carlin {{mentions}} <b>mescaline</b> {{use during}} his youth while being interviewed.|$|E
25|$|Carlos Santana told in 1989 {{about his}} <b>mescaline</b> {{use in a}} Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the similar}} name, mezcal {{does not contain}} <b>mescaline</b> or other {{psychedelic}} substances.|$|E
25|$|Difluoromescaline and trifluoromescaline {{are more}} potent than <b>mescaline,</b> as is its {{amphetamine}} homologue trimethoxyamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|Aldous Huxley {{described}} {{his experience with}} <b>mescaline</b> in the essay The Doors of Perception.|$|E
25|$|In Russia <b>mescaline,</b> its {{derivatives}} and mescaline-containing {{plants are}} banned as narcotic drugs (Schedule I).|$|E
25|$|Sand later {{started a}} perfume {{company as a}} front for the {{production}} of <b>mescaline</b> and DMT.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, France, The Netherlands and Germany, <b>mescaline</b> in {{raw form}} and dried mescaline-containing cacti are {{considered}} an illegal drug. However, anyone may grow and use peyote, or Lophophora williamsii, {{as well as}} Echinopsis pachanoi and Echinopsis peruviana without restriction, as it is specifically exempt from legislation. In Canada, <b>mescaline</b> is classified as a schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, whereas peyote is exempt.|$|E
25|$|Psychedelic {{research}} pioneer Alexander Shulgin said he {{was first}} inspired to explore psychedelic compounds by a <b>mescaline</b> experience.|$|E
25|$|Disney {{animator}} Ward Kimball described {{participating in}} a study of <b>mescaline</b> and peyote conducted by UCLA in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Other {{experiments}} involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under {{code name}} MKSEARCH), <b>mescaline,</b> psilocybin, scopolamine, cannabis, alcohol, and sodium pentothal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> acts {{similarly}} to other psychedelic agents. It binds to and activates the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor {{with a high}} affinity.|$|E
25|$|Michael Cera used real <b>mescaline</b> for {{the movie}} Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus, as {{expressed}} in an interview.|$|E
25|$|Prominence {{of color}} is distinctive, {{appearing}} brilliant and intense. Recurring visual patterns observed during the <b>mescaline</b> experience include stripes, checkerboards, angular spikes, multicolor dots, and very simple fractals that turn very complex. Aldous Huxley described these self-transforming amorphous shapes as like animated stained glass illuminated from light {{coming through the}} eyelids. Like LSD, <b>mescaline</b> induces distortions of form and kaleidoscopic experiences but they manifest more clearly with eyes closed and under low lighting conditions.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance builds with {{repeated}} usage, lasting {{for a few}} days. <b>Mescaline</b> causes cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} and identified in 1897 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter and first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Späth.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>mescaline</b> in {{purified}} {{powder form}} is a Class A drug. However, dried cactus {{can be bought}} and sold legally.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Panorama filmed Christopher Mayhew taking <b>mescaline</b> under medical supervision. The {{resulting}} programme {{was never}} broadcast, though the footage and transcripts were later released.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) is a {{naturally}} occurring psychedelic alkaloid of the phenethylamine class, {{known for its}} hallucinogenic effects {{comparable to those of}} LSD and psilocybin.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychedelic}} drugs psilocin/psilocybin, DMT, <b>mescaline,</b> psychedelic mushroom and LSD are agonists, {{primarily at}} 5HT2A/2C receptors. The empathogen-entactogen MDMA releases serotonin from synaptic vesicles of neurons.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the well}} known {{particular}} psychedelic substances {{that have been used}} to this day are: LSD, DMT, psilocybin, <b>mescaline,</b> 2C-B, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, AMT, ibogaine and DOM.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> elicits {{a pattern}} of {{sympathetic}} arousal, with the peripheral nervous system being a major target for this substance. Effects typically begin a while after ingestion, and may {{last a long time}} depending on dosage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> induces a {{psychedelic}} state {{similar to}} those produced by LSD and psilocybin, but with unique characteristics. Subjective effects may include altered thinking processes, an altered sense of time and self-awareness, and closed- and open-eye visual phenomena.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mescaline</b> is {{produced}} when products of natural mammalian catecholamine-based neuronal signalling such as dopamine and serotonin {{are subjected to}} additional metabolism via methylation, and mescaline's hallucinogenic properties stem from its structural similarities with these two neurotransmitters. In plants, this compound may be the end-product of a pathway utilizing catecholamines {{as a method of}} stress response, similar to how animals may release compounds such as cortisol when stressed. The in vivo function of catecholamines has not been investigated, but they may function as antioxidants, as developmental signals, and as integral cell wall components that resist degradation from pathogens. The deactivation of catecholamines via methylation produces alkaloids such as <b>mescaline.</b>|$|E
25|$|How {{activating}} the 5-HT2A receptor {{leads to}} psychedelia is still unknown, {{but it is}} likely that somehow it involves excitation of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. <b>Mescaline</b> is also known to bind to and activate the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.|$|E
25|$|Hunter S. Thompson {{wrote an}} {{extremely}} {{detailed account of}} his first use of <b>mescaline</b> in First Visit with Mescalito, appearing in his book Songs of the Doomed, as well as featuring heavily in his seminal novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine and {{phenylalanine}} {{serve as}} the metabolic precursors to synthesis of <b>mescaline.</b> Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via tyrosine decarboxylase to generate tyramine and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a monophenol hydroxylase or first be hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase to form L-DOPA and decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) by an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and methylated by COMT. The product, methylated at the two meta positions {{with respect to the}} alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of <b>mescaline.</b>|$|E
