40|$|Corrosion is the {{deterioration}} of a substance usually a metal or its properties because of a reaction with its environment (NACE, 1984). Corrosion is the unwanted or undesired loss of material due to a reaction of the material with its surrounding or environment. Corrosion also means the breaking down of essential properties in a material due to chemical reactions with its surroundings, which is in other word; corrosion means a loss of electrons of metals reacting with water and oxygen (Goel, 1986). Lost in production and material replacement due to corrosion mechanisms cost billions of dollars annually to industry. These economic losses {{can be divided into}} two groups which are called direct losses and indirect losses. The terms of direct losses means increasing of cost. The example of direct cost are costs of replacement of machinery and their component, costs of <b>maintenance</b> <b>or</b> <b>servicing,</b> costs of rebuilding or construction, costs for equipment capital, costs for environmental regulations, costs in chemical expenses and cost for safety considerations.

Moreover, Transformational Leadership that implemented by the head of section service {{had not been able to}} improve Work Discipline at PT. Nasmoco Pemuda Semarang, especially in servicing section. This study aims to determine the effects of Transformational Leadership, Organizational Culture, and Work Discipline toward the Employee Performance. This study uses census method with a sample of 70 employees that will be investigated. Data were analyzed through the validity, reliability, crosstab, product moment correlation, coefficient of determination, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, t test and F test. The result shows that Transformational Leadership has significant effect on the Employee Performance. Work Discipline has significant effect on the Employee Performance and Organizational Culture significantly influences the employee performance. Simultaneously, the Transformational Leadership, Discipline Work and Cultural Organization have significant effect on the Employee Performance. Based on the multiple regression test, the results of beta coefficient figures show 0. 226, 0. 271, and 0. 421, for Transformational Leadership, Work Discipline, and Cultural Organization respectively. Organizational Culture provides the most impact on employee performance. Based on the research result, it suggested to improve Transformational Leadership could be executed by improving the ability of the leadership in getting closer to his employees. Moreover, the improvement of Work Discipline could be achieved by providing appreciation and improving control. The improvement of Organizational Culture could be performed by working more excited.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a modification of}} the classical flow shop problem with infinite buffer capacities. The processing times on various machines are variable: the more one delays {{the beginning of an}} operation, the longer is its processing time. There are many industrial applications for this model, for instance in the planning of machine <b>maintenance</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> and in steel production where the material will cool during the waiting periods and has to be reheated for the subsequent process. The problem turns out to be already NP-hard in the strong sense for two processors, and in general the optimal schedule is not a permutation schedule. In the literature, a restricted problem is considered where one wants to determine the optimal release times for the jobs, once their order is given. We shall solve this m-machine flow shop problem by a greedy placement algorithm. For the two-machine case, where also the optimal order of the jobs has to be determined, several approximate solution methods are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The design of geogrid {{reinforced}} walls and slopes, although a well-established science, still contains many unknowns, particularly around long-term serviceability. Serviceability, for walls and slopes, {{is associated with}} excessive deformation or damage affecting appearance, <b>maintenance</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> life. In most designs, the serviceability limit state is not considered critical. Currently, most serviceability checks do not attempt to determine or prescribe deformation limits on the built wall or slope, but rather impose limits on the theoretical mobilised strains of geogrid reinforcement, considering the unfactored imposed loads. In many cases, these prescribed post-construction allowable strain limits are based on long-term, or accelerated creep testing, undertaken when the geogrid is not interacting with soil. In some situations, designs are grossly overconservative. This paper reviews {{the current state of}} practice, summarising some of the serviceability design issues around geogrid reinforced walls and slopes, with a particular focus on long-term post-construction deformations. The paper goes on to highlight areas of non-conformity in serviceability design, between the major national codes in Europe, assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the paper highlights potential areas of on-going and further work that may offer {{a better understanding of the}} serviceability limit state of geogrid reinforced soil walls and slopes...|$|R

40|$|This is an {{open access}} article {{published}} by Elsevier and distributed {{under the terms of}} the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC BY 4. 0), [URL] is common for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of high value products to provide <b>maintenance</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> packages to customers to ensure their products are maintained at peak efficiency throughout their life. To quickly and efficiently plan for maintenance requirements, OEMs require accurate information about the use and wear of their products. In recent decades, the aerospace industry in particular has become expert in using real time data for the purpose of product monitoring and maintenance scheduling. Significant quantities of real time usage data from product monitoring are commonly generated and transmitted back to the OEMs, where diagnostic and prognostic analysis will be carried out. More recently, other industries such as construction and automotive, are also starting to develop capabilities in these areas and condition based maintenance (CBM) is increasing in popularity as a means of satisfying customers’ demands. CBM requires constant monitoring of real time product data by the OEMs, however the biggest challenge for these industries, in particular construction, is the lack of accurate and real time understanding of how their products are being used possibly because of the complex supply chains which exist in construction projects. This research focuses on current dynamic data acquisition techniques for mobile hydraulic systems, in this case the use of a mobile inline particle contamination sensor; the aim was to assess suitability to achieve both diagnostic and prognostic requirements of Condition Based Maintenance. It concludes that hydraulic oil contamination analysis, namely detection of metallic particulates, offers a reliable way to measure real time wear of hydraulic components...|$|R
