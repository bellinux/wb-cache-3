Described as new to science in 1913, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and western North America, where it grows in parks, gardens, and roadsides in woodchip mulch. Fruitbodies of the fungus have a dull brownish-orange cap with a <b>matte</b> <b>texture,</b> a grooved stipe, and a bitter, mealy taste.|$|E

50|$|Ashton-Drake Galleries {{produced}} nearly exact {{replicas of}} the 5 original Kenner dolls in 2005-2006, along with replicas based on the original Kenner outfits. The first release had skin-tones with a slight green tint. A second release in 2007 was less green and more peach-pink. Both releases have a <b>matte</b> surface <b>texture.</b> Ashton Drake in total released 12 different full-sized Blythe dolls, but ceased production in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Kahn used several {{techniques}} {{to give the}} galleries an inviting atmosphere. The ends of the vaults, which are made of concrete block, are faced with travertine inside and out. The steel handrails were [...] "blasted" [...] with ground pecan shells to create a <b>matte</b> surface <b>texture.</b> The museum has three glass-walled courtyards that bring natural light to the gallery spaces. One of them penetrates the gallery floor to bring natural light to the conservation studio on the ground floor.|$|R
5000|$|Acetal. Acetal is {{a highly}} durable class of plastics. Delrin is DuPont's trademarked name for a type of acetal. Delrin is hard, glossy and durable, and can also be doped to produce a <b>matte</b> <b>texture.</b> The {{friction}} between a steel or nickel guitar string, and smooth, glossy acetal is very low. Glossy delrin picks literally glide across the string and therefore have a fast release, producing very little pick noise, while delivering a rounded tone emphasizing the lower order harmonics. Matte finish acetal picks like the Clayton Acetal generate a bit more pick noise, and a more aggressive attack, but the additional friction of the matte surface helps the guitarist hold the pick more securely. Delrex is a variation of Tortex, which is by itself Delrin. It was invented to replace tortoiseshell since the trade of tortoiseshell was banned in 1973. Delrex is used as the material for Dunlop's [...] "gator" [...] picks.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 2001, Takara first {{released}} new Blythe dolls sporadically, {{but then}} began releasing new versions of Blythe each month. Under the creative direction of Junko Wong, CWC has produced 207 of the Neo Blythes, 211 of Petites, and 17 {{of the newest}} addition to the Blythe line, the Middie Blythe dolls. Every one of these Blythes were exhibited at Parco Factory at the 10th Anniversary from June-July 2011. Newer releases of the Petit Blythe dolls have [...] "sleepy eyes" [...] and bendable bodies. The Middies' heads tilt and their eyes look left and right without changing color. The bodies of the full-size dolls {{vary depending on the}} time of the release. Early releases in 2001-2002 used the body of the Licca doll. In June 2002, in commemoration of 1 year of Blythe releases by Takara/CWC, the doll Miss Anniversary was released featuring the [...] "Excellent Body" [...] that was quite similar to the original Blythe released by Kenner. Early dolls also had a glossy surface texture, but some had matte face too. The earliest face molds of the reproduction Blythe dolls are referred to as BL. Two more face molds followed the BL mold, the Excellent mold, or EBL, and the Superior mold, or SBL, in 2003. In 2006 a new face mold, the Radiant mold or RBL, was introduced to look more Kenner-like, including slightly wider eyes. In 2009 another new face mold, the Fairest mold or FBL, was released with <b>matte</b> <b>texture</b> and smaller eye holes. The BL and EBL mold are actually the same mold. The difference in the EBL mold were important internal changes to make the eye mechanism more resistant. In 2013, due to wearing in the Radiance mold, or RBL, a new mold called Radiance+, or RBL+, was released and it's supposed to look exactly like the Radiance mold. Some changes were made in the eye mechanism as well, it became a lot lighter and easier to change the eyes compared to older releases.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} Claudin 6, {{a member of a}} new super family of TJ molecules, in the skin, we overexpressed it using the promoter for the differentiation marker, involucrin (Carrot et. al. 1993). Homozygous INV-Claudin 6 animals exhibit epidermal differentiation aberrations that result in incomplete formation of EPB and neonatal death (Turksen and Troy 2002). Heterozygote animals have milder EPB defects and survive to adulthood. All heterozygotes have pronounced abnormalities in their coat characterized by fuzzy hairs and a <b>matte</b> <b>texture.</b> In agreement with our hypothesis, the anagen phase of the hair cycle (starting at P 14) was shortened, and the catagen-telogen transition was prolonged. Expression of epidermal differentiation markers K 14 K 5, K 15, K 1, Loricrine, involucrin, Filaggrin and transglutaminase 3 were perturbed in the transgenic epidermis. The expression of hair keratins was downregulated in Inv-Claudin 6 hair follicles while the expression of K 5, K 6, K 15 and K 17 was maintained. Overall, changes in the differentiation program, abnormalities in hair fibers and hair cycling support the notion that Claudins are crucial members of signaling pathways) which modulate cell physiology and epidermal and hair follicle differentiation.

50|$|Paint has {{now been}} {{superseded}} by digital images created using photo references, 3-D models, and drawing tablets. Matte painters combine their digitally <b>matte</b> painted <b>textures</b> within computer-generated 3-D environments, allowing for 3-D camera movement. Lighting algorithms used to simulate lighting sources expanded in scope in 1995, when radiosity rendering was applied to film {{for the first time}} in Martin Scorseseâ€™s Casino. Matte World Digital collaborated with LightScape to simulate the indirect bounce-light effect of millions of neon lights of the 70s-era Las Vegas strip. Lower computer processing times continue to alter and expand matte painting technologies and techniques.|$|R

These items can be handled with bare hands that are clean and dry. However, body oils can stain the surface of these materials especially because of their <b>matte,</b> porous surface <b>texture</b> or those that are light in color. Wearing cotton or latex gloves is one way to prevent the transition of these harmful oils.|$|R
5000|$|Bisque {{porcelain}} or bisque {{is a type}} of unglazed, white porcelain, with a <b>matte</b> {{appearance and}} <b>texture</b> to the touch. It has been widely used in European pottery, mainly for objects that are not tableware and so do not need a glaze for protection. Although the term [...] "biscuit" [...] is often used to refer to it, bisque is only a subgroup of unglazed biscuit pottery, which for most pottery is a stage after a first firing before a glaze is applied.|$|R

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical refences. Image motion can {{convey a}} broad range of object {{properties}} including 3 D structure (structure from motion, SfM), animacy (biological motion), and its material. Our understanding of how the visual system may estimate complex properties such as surface reflectance or object rigidity from image motion is still limited. In order to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying surface material understanding, a natural point to begin with is to study the output of filters that mimic response properties of low level visual neurons to different classes of moving textures, such as patches of shiny and matte surfaces. To this end we designed spatio-temporal bandpass filters whose frequency response is the second order derivative of the Gaussian function. Those filters are generated towards eight orientations in three scales in the frequency domain. We computed responses of these filters to dynamic specular and matte textures. Specifically, we assessed the statistics of the resultant filter output histograms and calculated the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of those histograms. We found that there were substantial differences in standard deviation and skewness of specular and <b>matte</b> <b>texture</b> subband histograms. To formally test whether these simple measurements can in fact predict surface material from image motion we developed a computer-assisted classifier based on these statistics. The results of the classification showed that, 75...|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of using glue as a binder {{is that the}} colours render as <b>matte</b> and opaque <b>textures</b> suited to austere or mournful images {{as opposed to the}} translucent appearance associated with oil. Many reds and blues bound in glue would have appeared with a brilliance and intensity difficult to achieve with oil. Unfortunately the surviving examples have greatly deteriorated over time, having suffered from colour alteration due to exposure to light. Furthermore, the solubility of glue derived from animal products has meant that the accumulated layers of dirt cannot be removed without damaging the linen or dissolving the pigment.|$|R
