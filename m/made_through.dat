5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{consider the}} figures of Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same. These conclusions have been <b>made</b> <b>through</b> comparisons between the figure of Gullveig/Heiðr's use of seiðr in Völuspá and the mention of Freyja introducing seiðr to the Æsir from the Vanir in Heimskringla. This is at times taken further that their corruption of the Æsir led to the Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has 33 known isotopes, all {{of which}} are radioactive. They have atomic masses that range from 188 to 220 u. 210Po (half-life 138.376days) is the most widely {{available}} and is made via neutron capture by natural bismuth. The longer-lived 209Po (half-life , longest-lived of all polonium isotopes) and 208Po (half-life 2.9years) can be <b>made</b> <b>through</b> the alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} <b>made</b> <b>through</b> {{the skin}} and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|Constanța Port {{is both a}} {{maritime}} and a river port. Daily, {{more than}} 200 river vessels are in the port for cargo loading or unloading or waiting to be operated. The connection of the port with the Danube river is <b>made</b> <b>through</b> the Danube–Black Sea Canal, which {{represents one of the}} main strengths of Constanța Port. Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E

5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} <b>made</b> <b>through</b> {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{maintains}} {{close ties}} to the industrial world. Many of these connections are <b>made</b> <b>through</b> Georgia Tech's cooperative education and internship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates the largest and fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged with providing opportunities for students to gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were <b>made</b> <b>through</b> the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E

According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is <b>made</b> <b>through</b> a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{named the}} Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, {{and later the}} Newaygo and Northport State Road, today's modern highway {{can be traced back}} to the 19th century and earlier. The southernmost section between Grand Rapids and Battle Creek {{parallels}} an early Indian trail. The modern highway was formed by July 1, 1919 along this segment. By the 1940s, a second section of highway was designated M-37, creating a gap between it and the original section. This gap was eliminated in the 1950s, completing the M-37 corridor in the state. Additional changes to the routing were <b>made</b> <b>through</b> the Grand Rapids area into the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is <b>made</b> <b>through</b> the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were <b>made</b> <b>through</b> a random draw. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, <b>made</b> <b>through</b> four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was <b>made</b> <b>through</b> observations of hydroxyl megamasers. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field, {{and the size of the}} splitting is linearly proportional to the line-of-sight magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.|$|E
