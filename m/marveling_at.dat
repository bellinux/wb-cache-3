In a BBC interview, Roth stated that using this direction as a title [...] "came to me because of Macbeth.

60|$|From Padua they {{journeyed to}} Verona, <b>marveling</b> greatly <b>at</b> the {{richness}} of the country. The footmen, however, grumbled at the flatness of the plain, and said that it was as bad as marching in the Holy Land. On their right, however, the slopes of the Alps, thickly clad with forests, reached down nearly to the road, and Cuthbert assured them that they would have plenty of climbing before they had done. At Verona they tarried again, and wondered much at the great amphitheater, then almost perfect. Cuthbert related to Cnut and the archers how men had there been set to fight while the great stone benches round were thronged with men and women looking on at their death struggles, and said that not unfrequently British captives were brought hither and made to contend in the arena. The honest fellows were full of indignation and horror at the thought of men killing themselves to give sport to others. They were used to hard knocks, and thought but little of their life, and would have betaken themselves to their bows and bills without hesitation in case of a quarrel. But to fight in cold blood for amusement seemed to them very terrible.|$|R
5|$|As a child, Morris {{was kept}} largely housebound at Elm House by his mother; there, {{he spent much}} time reading, favouring the novels of Walter Scott. Aged 6, Morris moved {{with his family to}} the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was {{surrounded}} by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in fishing with his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall's grounds, and spent much time exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout the country, <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang Chine. Aged 9, he was then sent to Misses Arundale's Academy for Young Gentlemen, a nearby preparatory school; although initially riding there by pony each day, he later began boarding, intensely disliking the experience.|$|E
5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E

Commentary in the film confirms that the young red-haired girl's identity in the field who was <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> Magneto levitating the Robert F.

When the timeline resets, Logan is astonished to discover that Jean and Cyclops are {{alive and well in}} the new timeline, suggesting that the events of the original X-Men films played out very differently.|$|E
25|$|Writers, painters, and filmmakers have {{produced}} innumerable {{works of art}} concerning the urban experience. Classical and medieval literature includes a genre of descriptiones which treat of city features and history. Modern authors such as Charles Dickens and James Joyce are famous for evocative descriptions of their home cities. Fritz Lang conceived the idea for his influential 1927 film Metropolis while visiting Times Square and <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> the nighttime neon lighting. Other early cinematic representations of cities {{in the twentieth century}} generally depicted them as technologically efficient spaces with smoothly functioning systems of automobile transport. By the 1960s, however, traffic congestion began to appear in such films as The Fast Lady (1962) and Playtime (1967).|$|E
25|$|Johansson {{finished}} a fine third for the struggling Onyx team (a result that meant {{they did not}} have to go through pre-qualifying in the first half of 1990), <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> the car's performance on a low-grip track and speaking of optimism for Spain. Nannini finished in fourth, while Pierluigi Martini qualified fifth and finished in that position, also leading for one lap; the only time in the Minardi team's 21-year history that it led a Grand Prix. Tyrrell racing finished in sixth for the 2nd consecutive race, although it was Jonathan Palmer that earned the point for them in Portugal. The new Williamses, however, suffered near-simultaneous and identical motor blow-outs. Up until then they looked promising.|$|E

Instead, he drew upon his prior experiences with the characters' actors, Tim Russ and Ethan Phillips respectively, to successfully vie for the role. [...] Executive producer Jeri Taylor was pleased with the casting of Wright, <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> his ability to bring credibility to the prospect of two characters in one.|$|E

A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death.

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{called it}} a {{restoration}} of [...] "originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. ... It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic." [...] James Berardinelli stated [...] "The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed stylistic features in common with Oscar Wilde, German Expressionism, the Brothers Grimm and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Reason {{was largely}} ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them Robert G. Ingersoll and the American {{abolitionist}} Moncure Daniel Conway, who edited his works {{and wrote the}} first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by The New York Times. Not until the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold. As writer Mark Twain said, [...] "It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the Age of Reason...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> its fearlessness and wonderful power." [...] Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).|$|E
500|$|Tipping the Velvet was {{critically}} acclaimed upon its release and Waters' writing style highly praised. Harriet Malinowitz {{wrote that the}} story is an [...] "utterly captivating, high octane narrative" [...] and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote, [...] "Could this be a new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take it with you. It's gorgeous." [...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> the author's craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort." [...] Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters' vision of a lesbian past.|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Peggy Carter, {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve, is stuck {{compiling}} data instead of working field cases. One night while alone in the office, the case line rings, informing Carter of the location of the mysterious Zodiac. She goes to the location, and is able to retrieve the serum single-handedly. The next day, her boss, Agent John Flynn, reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission. Carter explains that the mission was time-sensitive, but Flynn is unmoved, dismissing the indignant Carter as an [...] "old flame" [...] of Captain America's who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. The case line rings again, this time with Howard Stark on the other end, who tells Flynn to inform Carter that she will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credit scene, Dum Dum Dugan is seen poolside with Stark, <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> two women wearing the newly created bikinis.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{waking up}} {{on the morning of}} flight day six three and a half minutes early, they {{discussed}} with Mission Control in Houston the day's timeline of events. The second lunar excursion's primary objective was to visit Stone Mountain to climb up the slope of about 20 degrees to reach a cluster of five craters known as [...] "Cinco Craters." [...] After preparations for the day's moonwalk were completed, the astronauts climbed out of the Lunar Module. After departing the immediate landing site in the lunar rover, they arrived at the day's first destination, the Cinco Craters, [...] from the LM. At [...] above the valley floor, the pair were at the highest elevation above the LM of any Apollo mission. After <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> the view (including South Ray) from the side of Stone Mountain, which Duke described as [...] "spectacular," [...] the astronauts gathered samples in the vicinity. After spending 54 minutes on the slope, they climbed aboard the lunar rover en route to the day's second stop, station five, a crater [...] across. There, they hoped to find Descartes material that had not been contaminated by ejecta from South Ray Crater, a large crater south of the landing site. The samples they collected there, although their origin is still not certain, are, according to geologist Don Wilhelms, [...] "a reasonable bet to be Descartes." [...] The next stop, station six, was a [...] blocky crater, where the astronauts believed they could sample the Cayley Formation as evidenced by the firmer soil found there. Bypassing station seven to save time, they arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. There, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, crystalline rocks rich in plagioclase. At station nine, an area known as the [...] "Vacant Lot," [...] which was believed to be free of ejecta from South Ray, they spent about 40 minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, they arrived at the final stop of the day, halfway between the ALSEP site and the LM. There, they dug a double core and conducted several penetrometer tests along a line stretching [...] east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, they climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15. After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with Mission Control, they reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.|$|E

Tellingly, Leskov {{was the first of}} the major Russian authors to notice Chekhov's debut and predict his future rise.

Leskov considered his long essay [...] "Sketches on Wine Industry Issues", written in 1860 about the 1859 anti-alcohol riots and first published in a local Odessa newspaper, then in Otechestvennye Zapiski (April 1861), to be his proper literary debut.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus travels toward Jerusalem, and the {{opposition}} intensifies: he is tested by Pharisees {{as soon as he}} begins to move towards the city, and when he arrives he is soon in conflict with the Temple's traders and religious leaders. He teaches in the Temple, debating with the chief priests and religious leaders and speaking in parables about the Kingdom of God and the failings of the chief priests and the Pharisees. The Herodian caucus also become involved in a scheme to entangle Jesus (Matthew 22:15–16), but Jesus' careful response to their enquiry, [...] "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s" [...] (Matthew 22:23), leaves them <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> his words (Matthew 22:24).|$|E
2500|$|Nikolai Leskov, then an {{anonymous}} reviewer in [...] (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it [...] "the best ever Russian historical novel" [...] and [...] "the {{pride of the}} contemporary literature". <b>Marveling</b> <b>at</b> the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for [...] "having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved". [...] "While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently {{the character of the}} nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers", Leskov wrote.|$|E

[...] Heinze is stunned that the show is able to pack so much original comedy into twenty-two minutes of airtime, and he has little sympathy for people who dismiss the show as being shallow or neurotically self-focused: [...] "People with little sense of humor have failed, time and again, to understand that the notorious self-centeredness of the show’s characters enables us to laugh at the selfish, neurotic traits we all share but prefer to disguise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The English {{were among}} the first who saw the {{tendency}} of Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait, and tried to understand why it did bubble. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling, and that nearly any wine could be made to sparkle by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it. This {{is one of the first}} known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that British merchants were producing [...] "sparkling Champagne" [...] even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it. Concurrently, advances in glass manufacture in Britain, by George Ravenscroft and others, allowed more robust wine bottle to be made which could contain the effervescence without exploding. The popularity of sparkling Champagne steadily grew. In 1663, the British poet Samuel Butler penned the first written English reference to [...] "brisk" [...] (i.e. frothy) Champagne in his poem Hudibras. The 1698 George Farquhar play Love and a Bottle featured one of the characters <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> the steady stream of bubbles in a glass of a Champagne. As the popularity of sparkling Champagne grew in London, other European courts began to discover the bubbly curiosity-including the French who had previously despised the bubbles as a wine fault.|$|E
