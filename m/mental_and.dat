5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has found that the higher one’s perceived status in society, the better one’s <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> well-being. The present research used a longitudinal design to investigate whether social contact with friends mediated this relation between subjective social status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> well-being among first-year undergraduate students at an Australian university (Wave 1 N = 749, Wave 2 N = 314). Participants completed an online survey that included measures of subjective social status, social contact with university friends during the past week, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> well-being during the past week. Multiple regression analyses found that subjective social status positively predicted amount of social contact with university friends, and that both of these variables positively predicted subsequent <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> well-being. Furthermore, bootstrapped mediation tests found that social contact with university friends acted as a significant mediator of the relations between social status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> well-being.
