25|$|By {{the second}} week of August 1778 Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the Chukchi Sea. He headed {{north-east}} up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice.

By early September 1778 he was back in the Bering Sea to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage, and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat walrus meat, which they had pronounced inedible.|$|E
