This approach allows students to recognize the economic consequences that standard setters sometimes consider in their promulgation of accounting and financial reporting rules. The result is that students acquire a greater depth and breadth of understanding of pension accounting rules and why those rules exist as they do. They also acquire a keener understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broader standard setting process.

50|$|Extending the Central {{line was}} <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> Residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jundah and Windorah regions (along the Thomson River {{south-west}} of Longreach) jostled for {{a line in}} their direction to run from Dartmouth, 50 kilometres east of Longreach via Stonehenge to Jundah and Windorah.

An alternative option to the south-west was therefore examined being a line from Barcaldine or Jericho (both further east of Longreach) down to Blackall the oldest town in the region. Although Barcaldine was fractionally closer to Blackall than Jericho, the latter prevailed because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land over the Barcaldine route had already been settled. The Blackall Branch was therefore approved in 1905 and had the potential to be further extended south-west to Yaraka, Windorah and beyond. The branch was 114 kilometres long and opened on 31 March 1908. Tiny sidings appeared en route at Joycedale, Lancevale, Yalleroi and Glenusk.|$|R

40|$|Following {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Komati Mill, Bosch Projects {{engineers in}} 1996 reviewed their design of that factory {{to create an}} even lower capital and maintenance cost design without sacrificing performance. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts was to recycle the mud from the clarifiers directly to an appropriate stage along a fixed or moving bed diffuser. Although the concept was not entirely novel, no past attempts had proven commercially successful.

In 1997, Tongaat-Hulett’s Maidstone Mill conducted successful trials on the process and applied for cane payment concessions to implement it on a commercial basis. During 1998, the Maidstone and Malelane mills both adopted the process permanently and by the 1999 season four other South African diffuser mills had followed.

40|$|Background and Problem: A {{major problem}} {{occurring}} in the last decades, which is more present now, when money is scarcer than before, is prioritizations by the employees within the health care sector. This problem might be even more present {{in the future as}} the population is increasing and aging. Prioritization settings also tend to be <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex structure where many different professions are involved in the prioritization process. The Swedish health care sector is a very emotive subject that affects everyone at some point in life. Hence, ethics seem {{to play a major role}} when prioritizations are done. <b>The</b> research question <b>of</b> this study is: Why are prioritization problems in the health care sector problematic and how can the situation be improved? Methodology: To answer our research question we have chosen to do a case study on Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The case study has been done through nine qualitative interviews with managers at different levels in the hierarchy at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Purpose: Our purpose is to identify and understand problems that arise in the public health care sector when prioritizations have to be done due to scarce resources. Result and Conclusion: During the process, we have identified several problems related to prioritizations. These are scarce resources, prioritization settings, a lack of integration between professions and between specialties, ambiguous directions from the region and a lack of ethical discussions. It is hard to identify a main factor that is <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> prioritization problems; instead there are many factors contributing to the problematic situation, but we think that better communication within the hospital can improve the situation. Suggestions for further research: • The problem within Region Västra Götaland. Why is it so hard to offer a homogenous health care to the population in the region? • Investigate the prerequisites for a leadership development program at SU. Would it be a good investment? • <b>The</b> National Model <b>of</b> Prioritizations is built on three ethical principles. How can this model be extended or completed to reduce the uncertainty regarding ethical dilemmas...|$|R

40|$|Background: This paper explores {{problematic}} Internet gaming in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> {{other forms}} <b>of</b> risky behaviour. <b>The</b> basic {{premise is that}} children and adolescents at risk will display different types of risky behaviour in various settings. Subjects and methods: Children and adolescents (N= 1150) were surveyed about (cyber) violence, problematic gaming (habits, motives and symptoms), self-disclosure via Facebook and self-esteem. Results: Regular gamers were more violent both face-to-face and via the Internet, and were <b>more</b> prone to <b>problematic</b> gaming than occasional gamers. Those who played games {{for more than five}} hours per day (9 % of respondents) were classified as potentially problematic gamers. They experienced and committed more violence both face-to-face and via the Internet, were more involved in self-disclosure and had <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> gaming symptoms than those who played for less than five hours a day, but these groups did not differ in self-esteem. Participants could choose from a list of eight different motives for their gaming; those motivated by peer communication, a sense of control, relaxation, conformism, self-efficacy and to distract from problems reported <b>more</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>problematic</b> gaming than those not motivated by these factors. Gender, age, self-esteem, self-disclosure and committing violence contributed to explaining the variance in problematic gaming, accounting for about 26 % of its variance. Boys, lower self-esteem, more self-disclosure and committing both types of violence more regularly were connected with reporting <b>more</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>problematic</b> gaming. <b>The</b> results will be discussed in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a general proneness to risky behaviour. Conclusion: Committing violence against peers (both traditional and cyber) predicts significantly problematic gaming. This supports the premise that children and adolescents at risk are prone to exhibiting different forms of risky behaviour in different settings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A meshless {{numerical}} implementation {{is reported}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 -D Fleck-Hutchinson phenomenologi-cal strain-gradient theory, which fits within <b>the</b> frame-work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toupin-Mindlin theories and deals with first-order strain gradients {{and the associated}} work-conjugate higher-order stresses. From a mathematical point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> two-dimensional Toupin-Mindlin strain gradi-ent theory is a generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poisson-Kirchhoff plate theories, involving, in addition to <b>the</b> fourth-order derivatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displacements, also a second-order derivative. In the conventional displacement-based ap-proaches in FEM, <b>the</b> interpolation <b>of</b> displacement re-quires C 1 –continuity (in order to ensure convergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite element procedure for 4 th order theories), which inevitably involves very complicated shape func-tions. These shape functions involve large numbers of degrees of freedom in every element, including nodal dis-placements, nodal rotations (i. e. first order gradients of displacement), and even higher order derivatives. C 1 -continuous methods are mostly feasible only for one-dimensional problems. The standard approach for solv-ing Bernoulli-Euler beam problems is by employing C 1 -continuous Hermite cubic shape functions, interpolating both displacements and rotations (i. e., slopes). For two-dimensional problems, such as involving plate and shell analysis, C 1 -continuous methods are very complicated, and formulations for three-dimensional problems as they arise from strain gradient theories become more or less intractable. The high computational cost and large num-ber of degrees of freedom soon place such formulations beyond <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> practicality. Recently some mixed and hybrid formulations, requiring only C 0 -continuity, have also been developed and applied to strain gradient plasticity or elasticity problems. But they are even <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> While some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developed element...|$|R

40|$|Background Population health {{concerns}} related to physical inactivity and obesity appear in policy documents, government campaigns and popular media across western societies. Children {{and young people}} have been targeted for physical activity promotion and schools have been positioned as sites for intervention. In particular, Physical Education and school sport (PESS) has been framed as a key part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution. However, not only have interventionist programmes in schools showed little success, but they have also been highly criticised for stigmatizing fatness, contributing to a culture of surveillance and fuelling body image anxieties. Despite on-going work to improve health promotion {{in light of these}} criticisms, physical inactivity and obesity remain high on the agenda and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same challenges persist. Indeed, while the critical literature on health and physical education has been illuminating, it largely investigates curricula, teaching practices and surveillance technologies and few studies explore <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> pupils and their peers. Purpose Further research is necessary to understand how school peers contribute to pupils’ engagement with PESS. This paper, therefore, draws on Bourdieu’s notion of physical capital and seeks to understand how pupils’ physical activity is influenced by lived-body experiences in school spaces. The study Data were produced from a 6 -month bricolage-based study with pupils (N= 29, aged 13 - 14) across four diverse school settings in England. Multiple qualitative methods were deployed to enhance methodological rigor with what is often a challenging age group for research. <b>The</b> interpretation <b>of</b> data was theorised using <b>the</b> well-established concept <b>of</b> physical capital (Bourdieu, 1986, 1977; Shilling, 2010, 1991) which had significant epistemological contributions to the findings. Findings Pupils themselves play a significant part in establishing the physical body as a symbol of power and status in school settings. Participants understood <b>the</b> health risks <b>of</b> being both underweight and obese, but they regarded obesity as being <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate social risks of “standing out as the bigger one”. Following this rationale, participants sought to accumulate physical capital through engaging in exercise as a purposeful calorie burning activity intended to avoid the pity, abnormality and derision which is expected to be directed towards overweight pupils. Furthermore, during PESS in clear view of peers, distinctions between physical capital could be made by recognising differences in sporting skill. In this context, physical capital mediated engagement in PESS in various ways. Conclusion This study has revealed that peers play a significant part in constructing <b>the</b> lived-body experiences <b>of</b> young people. In order to challenge <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> consequences <b>of</b> school-based health promotion interventions, it is crucial to attend to pupils’ relationships with peers as well as addressing policies, curricula and teaching practices.

40|$|Henry James's phrase, `white, marmorean flock', {{has become}} the {{defining}} image for the American women sculptors who worked in Rome in the midnineteenth century at <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> neoclassicism, subsuming their works and histories under <b>the</b> connotations <b>of</b> its words. Instead of simply permitting us to name these sculptors, `white, marmorean flock' raises both a problem of historiography, as a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women sculptors from questionable canons, and, <b>more</b> importantly, a <b>problematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feminine and subjectivity in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> artistic Symbolic activity.

Conflated with <b>the</b> objects <b>of</b> her creative production in a `Pygmalion effect', the woman sculptor is figured in Hawthorne's novel as a limit, embodying an impossible (for phallic cultural discourses) coincidence of femininity and creativity. Read through a matrixial lens, sculptures by Edmonia Lewis intrude uncannily in these canonical narratives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, as <b>the</b> woman sculptor <b>of</b> colour in <b>the</b> studio destabilises and unfixes gender, race, and class identities. Here too <b>the</b> Sadean `nothingness' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neoclassical sculpture emerges as a limit {{in our understanding of}} nineteenth century modes of seeing -a limit which is perhaps best approached `through <b>the</b> defiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signifier', photography.

Conclusion: This study has revealed that peers play a significant part in constructing <b>the</b> lived-body experiences <b>of</b> young people. In order to address the criticisms raised about some school-based health promotion interventions, it is crucial to attend to pupils’ relationships with peers as well as addressing policies, curricula and teaching practices. Being sensitive to peer relationships and their understanding of health may help teachers and health promoters decide how to manage the spaces where PESS takes place. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Psychological verbs (“psych-verbs”) such as admire, amaze, fear, and frighten, {{have long}} been known to exhibit marked {{syntactic}} behavior in many languages. This behavior has inspired numerous analyses which assume {{that there is a}} unified explanation for the observed patterns. In this dissertation, I focus on <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> class <b>of</b> psych-verbs, <b>the</b> so-called Object-Experiencer (Obj-Exp) verbs (e. g. amaze, depress, frighten, fascinate) and argue, as some others have, that the explanation for their unusual character is primarily semantic in nature, and {{can be traced back to}} the ways in which humans conceptualize psychological events and processes. It is commonly argued that <b>the</b> special behavior <b>of</b> these verbs obtains only in their stative and/or more controversially non-agentive readings. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semantic properties <b>of</b> Obj-Exp verbs and their arguments, I explore a controversial topic in previous research: <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> stativity and passivization among different subclasses of Obj-Exp verbs in English. Analysis of corpus data shows that eventive and stative uses are available to all Obj-Exp verbs in both the active and passive. I show that the choice between active and passive uses is particularly sensitive to <b>the</b> causal role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulus and <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emotion denoted by the verb; together these determine <b>the</b> linguistic construal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation as either a causative process or an attitudinal state. Additionally, I examine the variable (un-) acceptability of English Obj-Exp verbs in agentive contexts, and offer experimental and corpus data showing that a given verb’s acceptability in an agentive context directly correlates with the tendency for its emotion to be associated with a controllable antecedent. These facts argue against analyzing differences in agentivity among psych-verbs at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> lexical semantic structure, and instead suggest treating agentivity as an inference arising from <b>the</b> total integration <b>of</b> semantic, syntactic, and contextual information in the clause. Overall, <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> these linguistic studies align well with recent theories developed in the psychological literature on emotion. nrpages: 321 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Social {{security}} systems in Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Soviet Union devote most of their resources to earnings-related pensions and neglect"targeted"interventions to aid losers from {{the transition to a}} market economy. As social insurance systems, they have <b>the</b> characteristic weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance model, paying benefits on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> past contributions or work history rather than need. Yet contributions and benefits are not closely enough related to enable the system to operate as social insurance in a market economy. More attention must be paid to <b>the</b> total impact <b>of</b> high payroll taxes on employment in a market economy. Some analysts have argued that contributors to the system (future pensioners) should receive their contributions as"savings,"in addition to which unemployment benefits and new social assistance system could be developed. Such a two-tier system would distinguish between social insurance and social assistance. The author discusses an alternative prescription - a"unified system,"in which the earning-related system would be curtailed, making it as"flat"as possible, thereby establishing a universal categorical age benefit. Other benefits, including unemployment benefits and family allowances, could also form part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. In principle, benefits in a unified system could be means-tested, but means-testing is not integral to the system, whereas it is <b>the</b> defining feature <b>of</b> social assistance in the two-tier model. Some analysts have arugued for a unified system in the short term (because of fiscal constraints), moving to a two-tier system later in the transition. Both types of systems exist in capitalist economies. Indeed, systems in many countries are an untidy mix of insurance and assistance. The author examines some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues that arise from the relationship between insurance and assistance in the transition and beyond. She derives three criteria for determining whether the two-tier model is viable, then applies the criteria to <b>the</b> small republic <b>of</b> Moldova. She concludes that Moldova probably does not fulfill the three criteria because it has experienced a severe economic shock and adjustment has been a long drawn-out process. The two-tier prescription may be <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> for countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Soviet Union than for the Eastern European states.

40|$|Acoustic imaging noise (AIN) {{associated}} with fast gradient switching during image acquisition is a confounding factor in auditory fMRI experiments. AIN interferes with <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> desired stimuli {{as well as}} inducing hemodynamic responses that distort {{the responses to the}} desired stimuli. Moreover, non-linear behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HDR to stimuli of varying intensities and durations make analysis <b>of</b> fMRI data <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> Therefore, characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure HDRs induced by AIN as a function of intensity of AIN may improve <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> responses to <b>the</b> desired auditory stimuli. ^ In this study, we conducted two fMRI sessions on each of 11 subjects {{in order to determine the}} HDRs induced by AIN in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> amplitude and spatial extents. Two AIN stimuli of varying duration were employed (1 ping – 0. 1 s duration, and 10 pings – 1 s duration), and two AIN intensities were evaluated by using earplug/earmuff combination and earmuff alone at 3. 0 T fMRI. ^ Estimated HDRs to each stimuli duration and intensity were obtained by averaging across voxels within <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> interest (Heschl 2 ̆ 7 s gyrus), across runs, and across subjects. T-tests comparing the HDRs induced by stimuli of varying intensities show that there was not a statistically significant difference in HDRs. Moreover, all modeled HDRs using double gamma variate function based on estimated HDRs illustrate similar time-course. From <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> modeled HDRs to 1 ping with those to 10 pings, increase in amplitude and distribution was observed in a long ping duration. These results suggest that difference in acoustic imaging noise (15 dB) we provided has little effect on waveform of HDRs. ^ In statistical activation maps for 1 ping duration, AIN induced activation on primary auditory cortex as well as secondary auditory cortex, and spatial extents of activation between different AIN intensities were similar. For 10 pings AIN, earplug and earmuff combination made spatial extent of activation more concentrated on primary and secondary auditory cortex, which enable <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> distortion by AIN to focus on the auditory cortex. Therefore, large attenuation leads to reduced spatial extent of activation, especially for long AIN. Moreover, AIN at longer duration produced more activity which may generate more distortions on HDRs to desired stimulus. ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{countries}} with a value-added tax (VAT) exempt {{financial intermediation services}} from the tax. While exemption is generally perceived to be undesirable, it is also widely regarded as unavoidable because of technical difficulties in applying VAT to these services. This article reviews the standard rationale for exempt treatment and then considers <b>the</b> relative merits <b>of</b> two recent challenges raised in the tax literature. The first challenge involves <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> cash flow taxation to financial intermediation services {{in a manner that}} is consistent with an invoice/credit VAT (which is the dominant form). The second challenge proposes a comprehensive system of zero-rating of financial intermediation services, which is supported by a characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household consumption <b>of</b> such services as non-taxable. The author argues that each of these alternatives to an exemption system suffers from both theoretical and practical implementation difficulties that make maintenance <b>of</b> exempt treatment <b>the</b> preferred approach, at least in the short term. There is, however, a simpler alternative to these fundamental reform options, involving modification of just one aspect of an exemption system to relieve some <b>of</b> its <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> aspects. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpretative problems and associated inefficiencies that plague an exemption system arise from the need to distinguish between taxable and exempt financial services. The author argues that these difficulties can be eliminated, to a large extent, by basing the distinction on <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> prices. In support of this approach, he points out that it is consistent with the underlying reasons for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> exempt treatment. <b>The</b> author considers a number of other possible modifications, but these are either rejected outright or viewed with a healthy skepticism. For example, the author is critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparent rationale for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> cash flow taxation to property and casualty insurers. He also rejects proposals that accept some looseness in the formulaic allocation by financial intermediaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> business inputs between exempt and taxable services for input credit purposes. In his view, an explicit reliance on pricing structures to draw the boundary between exempt and taxable services is preferable to <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> relief for blocked input tax credits of financial intermediaries. Finally, the author is skeptical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case for a policy response intended to address the tax bias under an exemption system for financial intermediaries to insource supplies. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Oligonucleotides are {{synthesised}} {{almost exclusively}} via the solid-supported phosphoramidite method. However popular this method may be, the expensive reagents used {{in large excess}} during the synthesis as well as <b>the</b> large amounts <b>of</b> organic and aqueous solvents and purification steps makes <b>the</b> scale-up <b>of</b> oligonucleotide synthesis costly and possibly harmful to the environment. <b>The</b> therapeutic use <b>of</b> anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) is hindered by their susceptibility to nuclease catalysed hydrolysis and to overcome this problem ASOs have been modified commonly by <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> a phosphorothioate backbone. This research aims to provide a better understanding <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis cycle, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulfurizing agent and sulfurisation of inter-nucleotide phosphite linkages, {{in order to make}} this method more sustainable and efficient. <b>The</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activation, alcoholysis and hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phosphoramidites 2 ´-methoxy- 5 ´-O-DMT-uridine 3 ´-CE phosphoramidite (UAm) and di-tert-butyl N,N-di-isopropyl phosphoramidite (DBAm) using several tetrazole activators found that complete conversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phosphoramidite UAm to products required an excess of activator and that this was due to <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> di-isopropyl amine during coupling. Conductivity measurements show that the amine deprotonates the acidic activator and that the ammonium and tetrazolide ions that are subsequently formed strongly ion pair (Kip = 6540 M- 1) removing free activator from solution. <b>The</b> tetrazole-catalysed reaction <b>of</b> phosphoramidites with oxygen nucleophiles was found to be first order with respect to phosphoramidite and activator and <b>the</b> nucleophilic displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> di-isopropyl amine group by the tetrazoyl group at phosphorus is rate-limiting. Investigation into the 3 -picoline-catalysed ageing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulfur transfer reagent phenylacetyl disulfide (PADS) has shown that the process is overall second order and is proportional to <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> PADS and 3 -picoline. Deuterium exchange experiments show that ageing proceeds via abstraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methylene CH 2 protons of PADS via an E 1 cB-type decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PADS molecule generating a disulfide anion and a ketene by-product which was trapped using an intra-molecular [2 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction. Mass spectrometry data shows that disulfide anions act as nucleophiles with PADS molecules to generate polysulfides which are the active sulfur transfer reagents in aged PADS solutions. Using pyridines that are less basic than 3 -picoline causes <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> degradation of PADS to become slower, indicating the possibility that <b>the</b> rate-limiting step <b>of</b> this process is <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disulfide anion. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> sulfurisation of phosphites by both ‘fresh’ and ‘aged’ PADS in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> 3 -picoline was found to be first order with respect to phosphite, PADS and 3 -picoline at low concentrations <b>of</b> each. However, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction becomes independent of base when using aged PADS in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> high 3 -picoline concentration. Brönsted correlations for <b>the</b> sulfurisation <b>of</b> alkyl phosphites using fresh PADS give a βnuc value of 0. 51, consistent with a mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by the phosphite on <b>the</b> disulfide bond <b>of</b> PADS to generate a phosphonium ion intermediate. This degrades to the phosphorothioate product via a base-catalysed mechanism which has been confirmed by removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methylene protons from the PADS molecule. Comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> βnuc values seen when altering <b>the</b> pKa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyridine catalyst used shows that <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction <b>of</b> fresh PADS is much more sensitive to <b>the</b> pKa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyridine than is aged PADS (βnuc = 0. 43 and 0. 26 for fresh and aged PADS respectively). This suggests that in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> aged PADS, <b>the</b> phosphite attacks the sulfur atom adjacent to the carboxylate group in the polysulfide chain. This generates a phosphonium intermediate which can be broken down via a much more facile S-S bond fission, as opposed to the C-S bond fission as seen in when using fresh PADS...|$|R
40|$|Delays {{are perhaps}} the most common and costly problem {{encountered}} in construction and civil engineering projects worldwide. According to the owner's requirements, in the Libyan construction industry, the owner's supervisor (OS) - either an individual supervisor engineer (SE) or a consultant organization (CO) - represents the owner on the construction site and {{plays an important role in}} monitoring <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consultant's (design team's) plans This involves monitoring <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractor and reducing <b>the</b> owner's risk <b>of</b> any liability or contractor claims. The OS also attempts to ensure that the owner's targets are met in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three main criteria of time, cost and quality. The OS has clearly defined guidelines and procedures to monitor quality and budget. However, monitoring time, and protecting the owner from any claims, is a <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> task. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OS's important roles is to ensure that the project remains on schedule, hence to protect the client from delays and associated claims. However, there are no existing means <b>of</b> determining <b>the</b> OSs' effectiveness in performing this task. In this thesis, a review of relevant literature is combined with a field survey <b>of</b> experts in <b>the</b> supervision <b>of</b> Libyan construction projects, to develop a method <b>of</b> assessing <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> both SEs and COs regarding construction project delays. This method produces a set of weighted criteria, which generates scores according to SEs' and COs 1 performances as perceived by those surveyed. The results indicate that Libyan SEs are currently deficient in a number of areas, particularly communication skills; obtained scientific, technical and legal knowledge; knowledge in dealing with claims; previous experience; and knowledge and use <b>of</b> modern techniques. <b>The</b> results indicate that Libyan COs are less deficient in a number of areas, but are most deficient in terms of motivation, and quality systems. The results have implications for the selection and appointment of Supervisor Engineers and for their professional development needs. This research also investigates causes of delay in construction projects in Libya. The most frequent delay causes in Libyan construction projects are: delay in owner payments to the XIcontractor; long administrative routines; instability of material prices; frequent adjustments and additional work ordered by owner; delay in administrative processes carried by owner's supervisor; unavailability of spare parts in the local market; supervisor delays in decision making and taking action on time; lack of or bad application of modern planning techniques by the contractor; the delay in communication between the supervisor and the owner to obtain required approval or permission; and unclear drawings and specifications prepared by the consultant.

40|$|In {{conventional}} notions <b>of</b> art, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> destruction usually {{carries a}} negative connotation {{and is not}} associated with creative acts. However, it can be demonstrated that destruction has, on several levels, from summons to <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> canonised values of traditional art (historical avant-gardes, Futurism, Dadaism) and more conceptually grounded reflections about <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> traditional art (Duchamp, abstraction of 2 ̆ 7 pure painting 2 ̆ 7 to <b>the</b> extreme limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium) to the actual violent and destructive acts in creation (the diverse neo-avantgarde practices, Body Art, Viennese Actionists, YBA, 2 ̆ 7 idiocy, 2 ̆ 7 etc.), been continually appearing in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> art at least since <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century. In the changed prerequisites for art from the 1960 s onwards, <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> artwork requires knowledge of theory and history of art, 2 ̆ 7 an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of art history: an artworld 2 ̆ 7 (Danto), which elevates an object from common reality into the artistic sphere. According to the institutional theory, <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> artwork takes place procedurally within the art world, which Danto defines as an 2 ̆ 7 institutionalised discourse of reasons, 2 ̆ 7 as an interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> a work {{that takes into account}} the current critical and historical perception that motivated the workonly such interpretation allows <b>the</b> registration <b>of</b> a certain work as artistic. In <b>the</b> discourse <b>of</b> reasons in <b>the</b> conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work The Burning Cross-i. e., in <b>the</b> interpretations <b>of</b> meaning that accompanied the work at its origin-several possibilities can thus be indicated. Medved interprets The Burning Cross as a deconstruction of a uniform meaning and criticism of logocentrism, which denies the cross <b>the</b> superordinate meaning <b>of</b> a Christian symbol and establishes it rather as a meta-linguistic symbol, which opens <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaping <b>of</b> meaning. To this interpretation we would like to attach ours, which recognises in the The Burning Cross a workof art that signalises <b>the</b> cognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extreme degree <b>of</b> metaphysical nihilism and which in <b>the</b> symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross, this traditional supreme symbol of Christianity, detects a vacated symbolic spot of transcendence, which concurs with <b>the</b> basic realiyation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-modern period - that there is no metaphysical guarantee of being. Such an interpretation, which like Medved 2 ̆ 7 s takes into consideration <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iconography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross in <b>the</b> entirety <b>of</b> Veryel 2 ̆ 7 s work to date, allows us to sum up <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> Veryel 2 ̆ 7 s iconography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross in three degrees (symbol recognition, symbol cleansing, establishment of meaning). Alongside such conceptual interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work there also appear readings which analyse The Burning Cross from a sociological point <b>of</b> view andfrom <b>the</b> standpoint <b>of</b> performance theory (Milohnić) the latter examines the work within <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> performances in Slovenia from the 1990 s that trigger a 2 ̆ 7 moral panic. 2 ̆ 7 Through <b>the</b> discourse <b>of</b> reasons-i. e., through interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workćs meaning that recognise the latter as a part of an other world-the world of art-a world of interpreted things-the work is entered into <b>the</b> catalogue <b>of</b> art. This is also proven outwardly by <b>the</b> acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work into <b>the</b> institutionalised frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art world-the international art exhibitions. Outside <b>the</b> discourse <b>of</b> reasons concerning themeaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, however, the perception and acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work proves to be much <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destructive procedure employed. In its reactions to the event in the media, the wider public disqualifies the work as non-artistic, as vandalism, propagation of religious intolerance, ideological and political incitation and even psychopathology. <b>The</b> discourse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disqualification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work The Burning Cross seemingly normalises only when the work is declaratively entered into the institution ofart, which informally guarantees the work its autonomy, or more likely, whenan immunisation against the (alleged) provocative intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorsis achieved through <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal system...|$|R

40|$|Hemodynamic {{regulation}} after acute hemorrhage depends greatly on {{an intact}} interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sympathetic nervous system}} and vasoactive hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, vasopressin, endothelins, and angiotensin II. An important effect of these hormones is to limit a hemorrhage-related decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO), to defend <b>the</b> perfusion <b>of</b> vital organs and tissues. If hemorrhage occurs during anesthesia, the situation may become worse because inhalation anesthesia per se is frequently associated with some degree <b>of</b> hypotension owing <b>the</b> decreased vascular smooth muscle tone, impaired myocardial contractility, and blunted autonomic nervous system baroreflex responses. The situation may become even <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> when two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful vasoconstrictor hormones known to date, endothelin- 1 and angiotensin II, become ineffective in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> therapeutic receptor blockade. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was to explore}} to what extent endothelin-A receptor inhibition impairs hemodynamic regulation and endogenous compensatory mechanisms during hypotensive hemorrhage in awake dogs, and in dogs undergoing different types <b>of</b> anesthesia. <b>The</b> results were compared with controls and with angiotensin II receptor inhibition. After permission from the Governmental Animal Protection Committee, a total of 112 experiments were perfomed in 28 Beagle dogs. The dogs were kept under highly standardized conditions and received a standardized dietary regime. The four different protocols were: 1. 	Controls 2. 	angiotensin II receptor blockade 3. 	endothelin-A receptor blockade 4. 	angiotensin II and endothelin-A receptor blockade These four protocols were performed under four different conditions: 1. awake dogs (n= 10), 2. under isoflurane (1 MAC) /nitrous oxide anesthesia (n= 6), 3. under isoflurane (1 MAC) / remifentanil anesthesia (n= 6), and 4. under xenon/remifentanil anesthesia (n= 6). Before the experiments started the dogs received an intravenous line, a self-retaining Foley catheter, after local anesthesia an arterial line (for invasive blood pressure measurement, blood gas analysis) and two percutaneous sheath, one for a pulmonary artery catheter and one for the hemorrhage procedure. After a baseline period of 30 min in awake dogs, anesthesia was induced in the three anesthesia protocols, and the dogs observed for one hour. Thereafter, in all protocols the dogs had 20 ml/kg body weight withdrawn (equal to 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total blood volume) within 5 min and were studied for another hour. After that, the shed blood was rapidly retransfused within 5 min and the dogs observed again for one hour. During the experiment, hemodynamic parameters were continously recorded. Cardiac output, arterial and mixed-venous blood gases, hormonal parameter (plasma renin acitivity, angiotensin II concentration, aldosterone concentration, vasopressin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, endothelin), and plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were measured at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> each observation period. For intragroup comparison (time course), a general linear model of analysis of variance for repeated measures was applied. Intergroup comparison was performed using Student t-test. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> sigificance for <b>the</b> error <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first order was adjusted according to the Holm procedure. Statistical significance was assumed a P< 0. 05. For results see table attachment in the original paper. The hormonal response to acute hemorrhage in control awake dogs was sufficient with activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin to keep a normotonic MAP. The CO decreased about 50 % at the same time. Isoflurane anesthesia induced a moderate hypotension with small activation of RAAS and vasopressin. In contrast, xenon anesthesia did not change MAP, but stimulated all vasoactive hormones including epinephrine and norepinephrine. After hemorrhage, decrease in blood pressure was more pronounced with isoflurane than with xenon anesthesia, whereas during xenon anesthesia catecholamine concentrations were very high. Angiotensin II receptor inhibition impaired short- and medium term blood pressure regulation after acute hemorrhage in awake and anesthetized dogs. Alternative vasoactive hormones like vasopressin and epinephrine (fast), and like norepinephrine and endothelin (slow) were activated to counteract hypotension, but were not sufficient. Endothelin-A receptor inhibition did not impair blood pressure regulation in awake and anesthetized dogs. After acute hemorrhage and isoflurane anesthesia, medium term blood pressure regulation was slightly impaired and vasopressin release was higher compared to controls. Combined receptor inhibition induced the most pronounced decrease in MAP and systemic vascular resistance in awake and anesthetized dogs. Angiotensin II receptor inhibition played the major role in blood pressure regulation compared to endothelin-A inhibition. But there is a distinct additive effect for blood pressure impairment after acute hemorrhage, when both receptors were inhibited...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho estuda a distribuição de recursos pelo Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar (PRONAF) entre 1999 e 2009, que é um programa de crédito, que se coloca como uma política pública para extinguir as dificuldades de acesso a recursos por parte dos agricultores familiares. O intuito é o de {{investigar}} se, apesar das modificações na sua legislação no sentido de aumentar a incorporação de agricultores familiares mais pobres em regiões mais pobres, o programa tem apresentado uma lógica de distribuição concentrada em agricultores mais dinâmicos e regiões mais desenvolvidas. Este estudo tem como pano de fundo a perspectiva teórica pós-keynesiana, na qual os bancos, enquanto agentes econômicos, são os principais responsáveis pela oferta de crédito, fundamental para o desenvolvimento econômico. Na visão de Keynes, os bancos levam em conta a sua expectativa quanto à capacidade futura de pagamento dos tomadores de empréstimos, às formas alternativas de rentabilidade de ativos e aos seus desejos de segurança. A perspectiva é a de que estes agentes econômicos têm a preferência de dirigir recursos para agentes mais dinâmicos, que podem oferecer maiores garantias; em espaços mais desenvolvidos economicamente; para setores econômicos menos arriscados. A tendência, a partir disso, é de concentração do crédito. O caso do setor rural é mais problemático devido ao maior risco associado às atividades realizadas no mesmo. Daí vem a hipótese do trabalho: de que o PRONAF poderia apresentar dificuldades de distribuição dos recursos aos agricultores mais pobres e especialmente nas regiões mais pobres. Efetuamos o estudo da liberação do PRONAF a partir de 1999. Tanto a análise da distribuição total para o Brasil como para cada região indicou, considerando-se o total do período, uma melhora relativa da distribuição entre 2003 e 2006 e uma piora na distribuição a partir daí. Além desta análise, estabelecemos indicadores de captação do PRONAF por município e os relacionamos com Indicadores de Desenvolvimento Rural, por meio da técnica estatística Análise de Correspondência, a fim de observarmos os perfis dos agricultores e dos espaços que têm recebido os recursos. Fizemos as associações para três períodos entre 2001 e 2009. Os resultados da associação destes indicadores mostraram que, no geral, a situação final dos municípios menos desenvolvidos foi pior do que a inicial, com exceção da região Nordeste. Além disso, observamos que, no geral, os grupos de agricultores de maior porte (D e E) melhoraram sua participação em detrimento dos grupos de menor porte (A, A/C, B e C). Por fim, associamos a participação do grupo B com o volume liberado pelo programa Bolsa Família (entre 2004 e 2006 e 2007 e 2009) na região Nordeste. Os resultados nos mostraram relação inversa entre o nível de desenvolvimento rural e o nível de recebimento do programa, mostrando que o Bolsa Família tem capacidade de chegar mais intensamente nos municípios mais pobres. Além disso, a participação do grupo B e o volume liberado pelo Bolsa Família também apresentaram uma relação inversa. A nosso ver, não é a dificuldade do próprio agricultor familiar mais pobre que explica o baixo acesso relativo, mas sim as dificuldades que lhes são impostas pela lógica bancária. This work studies <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> {{resources by}} <b>the</b> National Program for <b>the</b> Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Familiar Agriculture (PRONAF) between 1999 and 2009, {{which is a}} credit program, that positions itself as a public policy to extinguish <b>the</b> difficulties <b>of</b> access to resources by familiar farmers. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this work is to investigate if, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes in its legislation to increase <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poorest familiar farmers in poorer regions, the program has had a logic of distribution concentrated in the most dynamic familiar farmers and developed regions. This study has as background the post-Keynesian theoretical perspective, in which banks, as economic agents, are the main responsible for <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> credit, that {{is essential to the}} economic development. In <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> Keynes, banks take into account their expectations about the borrower&# 8223; future ability <b>of</b> payment, <b>the</b> alternative forms <b>of</b> return on assets and their desire for security. The prospect is that these economic agents prefer to direct resources to the most dynamic agents, which can provide greater guarantees, in most economically developed spaces, to the less risky sectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. The trend, from this, is <b>of</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> credit. <b>The</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural sector is <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher risk associated with the activities performed in it. Hence it comes <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work: that the PRONAF could present difficulties in <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> resources to <b>the</b> poorest familiar farmers, especially in poorer regions. We performed <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PRONAF&# 8223;s distribution from 1999. Both <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total distribution for Brazil and for each region indicated, considering the whole period, a relative improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution between 2003 and 2006 and a worsening in the distribution from then on. In addition to this analysis, we set up capitation indicators from the PRONAF by municipality and we associate them with Rural Development Indicators, by the statistical technique Correspondence Analysis in order to observe <b>the</b> profiles <b>of</b> familiar farmers and spaces that have received the resources. We made associations for three periods between 2001 and 2009. The results showed that, in general, <b>the</b> final position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less developed municipalities was worse than the initial position, except in the Northeast region. Furthermore, we note, in general, that the most integrated familiar farmers groups (D and E) have improved their participation in detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poorest familiar farmers groups (A, A/C, B and C). Finally, we associate <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group B with the volume released by the Program Bolsa Família (between 2004 and 2006 and 2007 and 2009), in the Northeast region. The results showed an inverse relationship between <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> rural development and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> receipt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Program, showing that the Bolsa Família is able to reach more intensely the poorer municipalities. Furthermore, the association between <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group B and the volume released by the Bolsa Família also presented an inverse relationship. In our view, it is not the poorest familiar farmers&# 8223; difficulty that explains the low relative access, but the difficulties imposed on them by the bank logic...|$|R
