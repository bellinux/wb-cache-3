Case Outline. A 21 -year-old female patient was admitted at our Clinic further evaluation and treatment of testicular feminization syndrome, which was diagnosed {{at the age of}} 16 years. The patient had never menstruated. On physical examination, her external genitalia and breast development appeared as completely normal feminine structures but pubic and axillary hair was absent. Cytogenetic analysis showed a 46 XY karyotype. The values of sex hormones were as in adult males. The <b>multisliced</b> computed tomography (MSCT) showed structures {{on both sides of the}} pelvic region, suggestive of testes. Bilateral orchiectomy was performed. Hormone replacement therapy was prescribed after gonadectomy. Vaginal dilatation was advised to avoid dyspareunia. Conclusion. The diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity is based on clinical findigs, hormonal analysis karyotype, visualization methods and genetic analysis. Bilateral gonadectomy is generally recommended in early adulthood to avoid the risk of testicular malignancy. Vaginal length may be short requiring dilatation in an effort to avoid dyspareunia.

40|$|Functional MRI (fMRl) of {{the human}} brain is based on a change in the NMR signal on T 2 * {{weighted}} images due to local changes in the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin during neural activity associated with the performance of a task. This is known as blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. If we wish to quantify these functional changes in image intensity we may use a scale of magnitude of signal change on a voxel by voxel basis. An alternative approach is to measure the magnitude of signal change and the variance in the data during the experiment and use these to generate a statistical image. The advantage of this approach is that the degree of physiological fluctuation in the data is taken into account when assessing the difference in signal level between two different functional states. The method of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) as developed by Friston and colleagues in our dept. is an advanced approach to generating functional brain images using PET or fMRl. The study of human cognition with fMRI is best performed using whole brain imaging methods. Ideally data acquisition should also be as rapid as possible.

Despite the therapeutic successes achieved by DES, {{there is still a}} considerable effort to develop the new stent platforms that would offer the better clinical outcomes than the current one. In parallel with the advent of stents, coronary imaging both invasive and non-invasive have also evolved to support the field. The catheter-based imaging modalities available to date examine the coronary artery using either acoustic-based or light-based signals. Each imaging technique has individual strengths in supporting the operator for procedural planning, assessing the stent performance and monitoring the stent safety and efficacy at short- and long-term follow-up. However, the major drawback of the catheter-based imaging technique is its invasive nature. Therefore, <b>multislices</b> coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an alternative method to evaluate coronary anatomy. The challenge in this field has been to improve the ability of CCTA to provide assessment of coronary anatomy equivalent to the conventional coronary angiography.

We describe {{the case of}} a 39 year old woman who came to our observation for acute abdomen due to a combination of double intestinal duplication (colon and ileum) and an incidental neuroendocrine tumor of the appendix. Materials and methodsA 39 year old woman who was admitted at with upper abdominal pain. <b>Multisliced</b> spiral CT scan showed a cystic lesion suggestive of an inflammed Meckel’s diverticulum. The patient was underwent an urgent explorative laparoscopy. The intraoperative findings revealed a cystic lesion of the anti-mesenteric side of transverse colon, apparently dissectable from the bowel and a second lesion with a strongly adherent and unresectable from the anti-mesenteric aspect of the small bowel. A combined appendectomy was also performed. The histological diagnosis was consistent with a typical intestinal duplication for both intestinal lesionsand an incidental 2 mm carcinoid tumor was also found in the appendix. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on p. o. day 5. At the presenttime she is well and following a regular oncologic follow-up. DiscussionThe rarity of this case is due to the concomitant presence of an incidental, sincronous, appendiceal NET. The elective treatment is surgical resection.

40|$|We {{employed}} high-speed <b>multisliced</b> X-ray-computed tomography {{to determine}} the relative volume contributions of rib cage (delta Vrc) and diaphragmatic motion (delta Vdi) to tidal volume (VT) during spontaneous breathing in 6 anesthetized dogs lying supine. Mean values were 40 +/- 6 % (SE) for delta Vrc and 62 +/- 8 % of VT for delta Vdi. The difference between VT and changes in thoracic cavity volume was taken to represent a change in thoracic blood volume (2 +/- 3 % of VT). To estimate how much of delta Vrc was caused by diaphragmatic contraction {{and how much of}} delta Vdi was caused by rib cage motion, delta Vrc and delta Vdi were determined during bilateral stimulation of the C 5 -C 6 phrenic nerve roots in the apneic dog and again during spontaneous breathing after phrenicotomy. Thoracic cavity volume (Vth) measured during hypocapnic apnea was consistently larger than Vth at end expiration, suggesting that relaxation of expiratory muscles contributed significantly to both delta Vrc and delta Vdi during spontaneous inspiration. Phrenic nerve stimulation did not contribute to delta Vrc, suggesting that diaphragmatic contraction had no net expanding action on the rib cage above the zone of apposition. Spontaneous breathing after phrenicotomy resulted in small and inconsistent diaphragmatic displacement (8 +/- 4 % of VT). We conclude that the diaphragm does not drive the rib cage to inflate the lungs and that rib cage motion does not significantly affect diaphragmatic position during spontaneous breathing in anesthetized dogs lying supine. status: publishe...|$|R

Therefore, the diagnosis of osteoid osteomas in these localization is difficult. In present study, we evaluated seven phalangeal osteoid osteomas in hand with respect to late diagnosis. Patients and methods: Seven patients (5 females, 2 males; mean age 21 years; range 17 to 23 years) who underwent surgery for hand phalangeal osteoid osteoma were investigated. Lesions were seen at four cases in right hand and at three cases in left hand. Twelve months was the longest diagnosis time while the earliest diagnosis time is 4 months among seven cases (mean 9 months). Results: In all cases lesions were seen in proximal falanges. The affected fingers were the second finger in four patients, third finger in one patient and fourth finger in two patients. All patients had been treated with nonsteroidal anti enflamatuar drugs before the diagnosis. Symptoms were relieved but did not disappear completely. The diagnosis was done by scintigraphy with increase activity and the nidus localization in some patients by computed tomography but by conventional radiograpy diagnosis was done in none of patients. Histopathological examinations of the peroperative biopsies confirmed diagnosis of osteoid osteoma in all cases. In two cases, lesions were treated by high speed burr, at the rest five patients were curettaged.

ObjectiveThe {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate safety, hemodynamic effects and imaging efficacy of systematic use of sublingual nitroglycerin just before a 256 slices CA scanner acquisition. MethodThirty six consecutive patients had a coronary MDCT acquisition after 1 spray of sublingual nitroglycerin (NatisprayR 0. 30 mg) (group 1). HR and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were measured before and after spray. Global imaging quality assessment, number of analyzable segments according to the syntax score segmentation, mean diameter and area of each segments was done by two blinded observers and compared to a control group of 36 consecutive patients (group 2) examined with the same machine, but without nitrates. ResultsBoth groups were similar considering age, sex ratio, BMI and beta-blocker used. In group 1 nitrates did not change heart rate (62 ± 5 vs. 61 ± 4 bpm) nor MBP (100. 7 ± 15 mmHg vs. 94. 9 ± 12 mmHg). A total of 536 and 531 segments were analyzed respectively in group 1 and 2. Global imaging quality assessment was equal in both groups (good quality: 93. 1 % vs. 91. 7 %, group 1 and 2 respectively). There was < 1 % of missed segments in group 1 compared to 3 % in group 2 (p= 0. 002), this represents 2. 1 % vs. 7. 2 % of secondary segments, p= 0. 03.
