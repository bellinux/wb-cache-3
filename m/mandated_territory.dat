25|$|In 1943, the Australian Army’s Colonel Alfred Conlon, who had {{previously}} chaired Prime Minister John Curtin's committee on national morale, {{was assigned to the}} staff of the Army’s commander-in-chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey. Alf Conlon believed the Army needed a research section to tackle major strategic contingencies, such as what to do if Japan invaded Australia, and persuaded Blamey to establish a Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Blamey assigned Conlon to head the Directorate, which also provided policy advice on the governance of the Trust Territory of Papua and the <b>Mandated</b> <b>Territory</b> of New Guinea, then under Australian administration and the scene of fierce fighting between Allied and Japanese forces.|$|E

A seaborne {{assault on}} Port Moresby was turned back in May at the Battle of the Coral Sea, {{after which the}} Japanese {{established}} a beachhead at Buna–Gona in late July as plans were made to capture Port Moresby via an overland route from the northern Papuan coast. Subsequently heavy fighting {{took place during the}} Kokoda Track campaign and around Milne Bay. The Japanese advance ended just before their objective and subsequently the Australians went on the offensive, eventually pursuing the withdrawing Japanese back to their beachheads around Buna and Gona where the Australians linked up with US forces and heavy fighting followed against the Japanese between November 1942 and January 1943.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, Pentland formed <b>Mandated</b> <b>Territory</b> Airways with {{entrepreneur}} Albert Royal to fly freight to {{and from}} the goldfields of New Guinea. The pair bought a DH.60Moth biplane, which Pentland ferried to the firm's base at Lae in February 1928. The business prospered in the short term, {{to the extent that the}} partners took on another Moth and more pilots. By the end of the year, however, Pentland was suffering from malaria and had to abandon the venture, selling one of the planes to Guinea Airways and returning to Australia with the other. After recovering in the new year, he embarked on a series of new enterprises, including aircraft manufacture, a flying school, and charter work. In February 1929, he formed the General Aircraft Company with Royal and another partner to produce an Australian-designed aeroplane, the Genairco, of which eight were eventually sold. With the Moth from <b>Mandated</b> <b>Territory</b> Airways, he established Pentland's Flying School at Mascot, New South Wales. He also flew charters with a Moth owned by The Sun newspaper, using the same aircraft that September to compete in the East-West Air Race from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the Western Australia Centenary. The event attracted several veteran aviators of World WarI, including Horrie Miller—the eventual winner on handicap—and Charles [...] "Moth" [...] Eaton, whom Pentland beat into fifth place across the line.|$|E
2500|$|A legal {{analysis}} {{performed by the}} International Court of Justice noted that the Covenant of the League of Nations had provisionally recognised the communities of Palestine as independent nations. The mandate simply marked a transitory period, with the aim and object of leading the <b>mandated</b> <b>territory</b> to become an independent self-governing State. Judge Higgins explained that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and {{to have their own}} State." [...] The Court said that specific guarantees regarding freedom of movement and access to the Holy Sites contained in the Treaty of Berlin (1878) had been preserved {{under the terms of the}} Palestine Mandate and a chapter of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.|$|E
