This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] The final, published version is available online at DOI: [URL] Change <b>Material</b> <b>Board</b> (PCMB) has been considered as {{an effective way to}} improve the thermal comfort in either new or existing buildings. In this work, firstly the optimal melting temperatures of internal and external PCMB are given, and the optimal heat storage capacities are obtained under the idealised circumstance of considering sinusoidal changes of the room and outdoor temperatures during a day. Secondly, to study the potential energy saving from applying a PCMB, a case study of a lightweight office with real environmental conditions is carried out. The air conditioning is switched on in the model to keep the indoor temperature within thermal comfort. Using the daily energy consumption and daily thermal comfort rate as the performance criteria, the effects of major influencing factors including melting temperature, latent heat and thermal conductivity of PCMB are studied parametrically. The results show that both the external and internal PCMB can achieve better performance when the melting temperature is chosen to be slightly higher than the average indoor air temperature. In the summer, the external PCMB has a better performance than the internal PCMB because the external PCMB works not only as a heat storage system whose function is similar to the internal PCMB, but also as a thermal connection between the outdoor and indoor environment due to its thermal insulation function, which reduces the influence of the changing outdoor environment...|$|E

40|$|One {{branch of}} the current {{research}} in aircraft design at Linköping University is focused on fast concept evaluation in early design stages. This covers multidisciplinary optimization using tools of different level of complexity and low-cost subscale flight testing. In some cases a flight test will provide more answers than several computations ever could. In order {{to achieve this goal}} a methodology is required to allow fast creation of subscale flying concepts and to obtain as much reliable information as possible from the tests. The methodology is currently being developed. One important part of it is the scaling methodology and the imposed requirements on manufacturing.

40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} of this work is to study and model the fracture process and durability of paperboard cores in cyclic loading. The results are utilized in creating analytic model to estimate the life time of cores in printing industry. The life time means here {{the maximum number of}} winding-unwinding cycles before the core delaminates. This study serves also as an example of use of board as a constructional engineering <b>material.</b> <b>Board</b> is an example of complicated, fibrous, porous, hydroscopic, time dependent and statistic material. Different core board grades are typically made of recycled fibers. The material model in this work is linear-elastic, homogeneous and orthotropic. The material characteristics, elastic and strength properties are studied first. Then the material is studied from the points of view of fracture and fatigue mechanics. Some of the analysis and test methods are originally developed for fiber composites but have been applied successfully here also for laminated board specimen. An interesting finding is that Scott Bond correlates well with the sum of mode I and mode II critical strain energy release rates. It was also possible to apply Paris' law and Miner's cumulative damage theory in the studied example situations. The creation of the life time model starts by FEM-analysis of cracked and non cracked cores in a typical loading situation. The elastic-linear material model is used here. The calculated stresses are utilized in analytic J-integral model. The agreement between analytic and numerical J-integral estimations is good. The analytic life time model utilizes the analytic J-integral model, Miner's cumulative damage theory and analytically formulated Wöhler-curves which were constructed by applying the Paris' law. The Wöhler-curves were constructed also by testing cores to validate the theoretical results. The testing conditions are validated by FEM-analysis. The cores heat up when tested or used with non expanding chucks and a temperature correction was needed in the life time model to consider this. Also, single or multi crack model was used depending on the studied case. The calculated and tested durability prediction curves show good correspondence. The results are finally reduced to correspond to certain confidence level...|$|E
