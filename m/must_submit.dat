Department of the Family <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons. This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual participants are selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of operation is reviewed and approved by the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E

These passports will no longer be valid since they are not machine-readable. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has decided that November 24, 2015 will be the deadline to implement the use of machine-readable passports only in travel through airports. Those who possess the red Lebanese passport must apply for the navy blue (machine-readable) passport as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|Once {{a student}} has met the three course requirement, {{he or she}} is then {{eligible}} to formally apply to the ALM program. Typically applicants <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> a completed application, proof of an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent) plus transcripts, resume, two essays, and a nonrefundable application fee. Some programs require additional specific classes {{to be part of the}} initial three before formal admission. Students will be denied admission indefinitely if they fail to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the Proseminar course.|$|E
5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.|$|E

5|$|Macedon {{began to}} {{encroach}} on territory claimed by several other Greek city states in 200 BC and these pleaded {{for help from}} their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip, unsurprisingly, refused and, after initial internal reluctance for further hostilities, Rome declared war against Philip in the Second Macedonian War. In the Battle of the Aous Roman forces under Titus Quinctius Flamininus defeated the Macedonians, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively. Macedonia was forced to sign the Treaty of Tempea, in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a war indemnity to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of the National Archives, including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> its proposal to both the National Archives Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the National Archives Heraldry Board and the PRV.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 April 2017, each {{potential}} candidate <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> a community declaration to the Community Committee. The Committee comprises a chairman, {{five members of}} the Chinese community (forming the Chinese Community Sub-Committee), {{five members of the}} Malay community (the Malay Community Sub-Committee), and five members of the Indian or other minority communities (the Indian and Other Minority Communities Sub-Committee). In a community declaration, potential candidates are required to state that they consider themselves a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities, and wish to apply for a community certificate to this effect. Alternatively, they can state that they do not consider themselves {{to be a member of}} any of these communities. The period for submission of community declarations begins three months before the term of the incumbent President expires, and ends five days after the date of the writ of election.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> to the IOC a {{bigger and more}} detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E

5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks <b>must</b> <b>submit</b> to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
