5|$|It is, as I <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> the key {{to unlock}} and detect almost all the {{impositions}} that have, at various times, arrested so much of public attention. It is a witness that can refute all false evidence, and will satisfy every discerner, how to appreciate, how to convict.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster <b>may</b> <b>say</b> 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
25|$|Corry was {{associated}} with {{what came to be}} called the Tory Party after the death of William Pitt the younger in 1806. Up until the extension of the franchise in 1832, the borough was strongly Tory in representation. The fact that no Tory or Conservative was elected after 1832 <b>may</b> <b>say</b> something about the unrepresentative nature of the old franchise.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} statement, one <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that {{whenever}} the classical {{equations of motion}} are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.|$|E

25|$|Syllable {{deletion}} – stressed syllables are emphasis {{that may}} be given to certain syllables in a word. They {{are more likely to}} be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process. So children <b>may</b> <b>say</b> helikat instead of helicopter or fowe instead of telephone. That way, they don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} that, {{once the}} Kohanim are assembled on the platform, the cantor or prayer leader will prompt them by reciting each {{word of the}} blessing and the Kohanim will then repeat that word. This custom is especially followed if only one Kohen is available to give the blessing. Apparently this prompting is done to avoid errors or embarrassment {{if any of the}} Kohanim should be ignorant of the words of the recitation. However, if {{there are a number of}} kohanim, they <b>may</b> <b>say</b> the first word of the blessing ("Yevorekhekhaw") without the prompting, presumably to demonstrate their familiarity with the ritual.|$|E

25|$|The {{programme}} {{focused on}} the exploits of a handyman - Simon Bodger (played by Andy Cunningham) - and his pet badger, who has a penchant (some <b>may</b> <b>say</b> an obsession) for mashed potato (although this {{always seems to be}} instant mash potato and not proper mashed potatoes). The first four series focused on Bodger's varying jobs as a handyman and his attempts to hide Badger from his bosses (who would inevitably fire him should they discover a badger on their premises). However, it is not revealed how Badger kept following Simon to work if he was not allowed there, or why Simon allowed it himself.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that your race {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E
25|$|People with aphasia may {{experience}} {{any of the}} following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms {{may or may not be}} present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication. Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like thing. So when asked to name a pencil they <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it is a thing used to write.|$|E

25|$|Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. These {{prayers are}} said by the sacred ministers {{standing}} {{on the floor at}} the bottom of the steps leading up to the High Altar. They are also said to each other, kneeling, by the acolytes and those servers sitting in the liturgical choir. If the acolytes are close enough, they <b>may</b> <b>say</b> them with the sacred ministers. These prayers consist primarily of Psalm 42 with the verses said alternately between the celebrant and the other sacred ministers. While these prayers are being said, the musical choir is singing the text of the Introit. After the prayers are finished, all rise. The sacred ministers ascend the steps to the altar to cense it.|$|E
25|$|A useful {{idea from}} {{mechanics}} {{is that the}} energy gained by a particle {{is equal to the}} force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P {{can be viewed as a}} force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of distance times area). We <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.|$|E
25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E
