England scored 292 and then dismissed South Africa for 47 and 43 {{to record a}} comprehensive victory. Bowden died 3 years later after being trampled by his own oxen after falling from his cart.

50|$|From {{a feminist}} perspective, the most {{important}} point to be drawn is that early human society was almost certainly organised along matrilineal lines with people tracing their kin ties through their mothers.

25|$|Yorkshire had {{a policy}} of not {{offering}} contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers {{by the end of}} July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no record}} of Liston's birth. His family's home state of Arkansas did not make birth {{certificates}} mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Sonny Liston, {{can be found in}} the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what year he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. He finally settled on a date of birth of May 8, 1932 for official purposes but by the time he won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston's most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very nice man... he <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old. We need to send it to an earlier generation." ...|$|E

500|$|In Skegness, Rye saw Davidson's {{death as}} a {{business}} opportunity; crowds flocked to see [...] "The Actual Lion that Mauled and Caused the Death of the Ex-Rector of Stiffkey". By contrast, Molly Davidson's financial situation was desperate. When her family applied to the church authorities for help, Archbishop Lang acted on her behalf behind the scenes and eventually she received grants from two church charities. She died in a Dulwich nursing home in 1955. Of the other major participants in the legal case, Pollock remained as Bishop of Norwich until his resignation in 1942, a year before his death. Davidson's girls—Rose Ellis, Barbara Harris, Estelle Douglas and the rest—disappeared from public view after the 1932 trial, although a 1934 letter from Davidson indicates that Harris was then working at the London store Selfridges, under the name [...] "Babs Simpson". When announcing a 2010 book about the war artist Leslie Cole, The Fleece Press revealed that Harris had married Cole after changing her name and had thereafter successfully concealed her true identity from all enquirers. Even her husband <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of her past.|$|E
500|$|Austen began {{a second}} novel, First Impressions (later {{published}} as Pride and Prejudice), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; {{as with all}} of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as {{she was working on}} it and it became an [...] "established favourite". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing First Impressions. Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it [...] "Declined by Return of Post". Austen <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of her father's efforts. Following the completion of First Impressions, Austen returned to Elinor and Marianne and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to Sense and Sensibility. In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|The heavy metal-inspired {{world of}} Brütal Legend was also well received, and {{considered}} {{to show a}} clear reverence for the genre. [...] Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be [...] "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" [...] and [...] "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements {{that made up the}} heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being [...] "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" [...] at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game {{may not be the most}} sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that [...] "no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at", while Donlan considered the world to be a [...] "constant unfolding delight". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have [...] "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of [...] "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation." ...|$|E

The language chosen for the dedication is probably in imitation of a verbose and comically pedantic style sometimes used by Lichfield, and certain other barber-surgeons at Cambridge, for entertainment. Throughout the epistle Nashe seems to be appealing to Lichfield to join him in attacking Harvey and his brothers, though the tone is edgy and it is unclear whether Nashe seriously expects a favourable response.|$|E
