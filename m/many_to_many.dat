The storage presented by a DAS to a connected host can of course be shared by that host. A SAN (storage area network) has {{more in common with}} a DAS than a NAS with the {{key difference}} being that DAS is a 1:1 relationship between storage and host whereas SAN is <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In June 2009, Shirky {{participated in}} a TED@State talk titled [...] "How cellphones, Twitter and Facebook can make history" [...] aka [...] "How social media can make history." [...] In the talk, he {{explains}} {{that this is the}} first time in history that communication is possible from <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many.</b> In the past, communication to a large group excluded the possibility of having a conversation, and having a conversation meant not interacting with a group and instead was necessarily a one-to-one structure. Shirky labels this incongruous exchange as asymmetric. In Shirky's view, this feature is one of the main reasons that the internet revolution is different from communication revolutions that preceded it.|$|E
5000|$|As {{telecommunication}} services are highly regulated and billing systems are complicated, an industry emerged as did standards (EMI) {{to simplify the}} process of taking the third party telephone records and placing those charges onto the 1400 US LEC bills. In the 1990s there were many long distance telecommunication providers, operator assisted telecommunication service providers, IXCs, and so forth who wanted to avert or defer the cost of implementing a costly billing system of their own, and by doing so, get to market more quickly. IXCs also understood that a single bill to the customer was desired. Companies like ZPDI, USBI, Integretell, Enhanced Billing Services (ESBI), OAN, ACI and many others emerged to reduce the integration complexities of these <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> relationships.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{single step}} {{communication}} was business to consumer orientated, where users took a passive {{role in the}} process with little feedback.Further studies have shown consumers {{are more likely to}} find interpersonal communication from influential people like family and friends more credible than mass media Such influential people are known as opinion leaders and formers, who maintain a high social standing within a given group or hold expert knowledge, for example, a doctor. These further developments highlight the importance of opinion leaders {{as can be seen in}} the two-step linear model of communication purposed by Roger, where opinion leaders function as intermediaries by interpreting and filtering information to their followers. These traditional models view paid media platforms as the primary source of information, however, this has changed due to technological developments in communication platforms which enable dialogue among consumers within a consumer-centric communication from which meaning is constructed. This multi-dimensional non-linear flow of communication allows a <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> exchanges of information through platforms such as UGC. UGC includes all the ways in which people publish creative content publicly online through blogs, chats, forums, online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, this is known as earned and shared media.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with describing an enumeration algorithm for the set of <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> stable matchings. In particular, we shall develop several elementary properties of such stable matchings, and use those to motivate an enumeration algorithm inspired by Martinez et al. ’s algorithm for finding the full set of <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> stable matchings. Finally, as an application, we shall introduce several optimization problems over the set of such stable matchings. Introduction: The Gale-Shapley algorithm presented a method to find the solution of {{a specific type of}} optimization problem over the set of stable marriages, namely that of finding the man (or woman) optimal stable marriage. This algorithm was adopted by Roth (1985) and Blair (1988) to find the firm or worker optimal stable matching in the <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> case. Surprisingly, both of these algorithms preceded by several year...|$|E
