40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} turn-off {{strategies are}} presented for 6. 5 kV class SiC Thyristors. A <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> of 62 A (284 A/cm 2) is successfully {{turned off by}} applying a reverse bias of ≈ 30 V to the cathode of a SiC Thyristor. The minimum turn-off time (tq) for the Thyristor using this forced commutation technique is investigated {{as a function of}} <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> density, reverse gate current and the dV/dt of the re-applied forward (blocking) bias. The Anode Switched Thyristor (AST) turn-off mode is demonstrated at a maximum cathode voltage of 3600 V and 14. 5 A (199 A/cm 2) of <b>cathode</b> <b>current.</b> A <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> of 5. 5 A (75 A/cm 2) is successfully turned off by the gate turn off (GTO) or hard turn-off mode at different temperatures up to 200 °C.

40|$|A {{diamond-like}} carbon (DLC) film was successfully deposited on SKD 51 by filter arc deposition (FAD). An interlayer of CrN between the substrate and the DLC film was formed, enhancing the adhesion and the mechanical {{properties of the}} film assembly. The film structure exhibited high sp(3) bonding under optimal conditions when the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> was varied. The process parameters were compared by studying various mechanical properties of the deposited films such as microhardness, adhesion and residual stress. The crystal structure was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The sp(3) bond content dominates at a <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> of 50 A and is inversely proportional to the <b>cathode</b> <b>current,</b> explaining why damage by the high beam current is associated with more graphitic character. The main contribution {{of this study is}} to help understand the relationship between the variation in the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> and the relationship between the interlayer (CrN) and DLC.

The influences of pre-plating <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> density, grits electro-embedding <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> density and time on composite deposite coating appearance and grits distribution of wire saw are analyzed, and the sawing experiment is carried out by using the trial wire saw.

50|$|A cathode is the {{electrode}} {{from which a}} conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device. (This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic CCD for <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> departs.) A conventional current describes {{the direction in which}} positive electronic charges move. Electrons have a negative charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> departs also means that electrons flow into the device's cathode.|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{electrochemical}} performance of LSM-based anode-supported single cells, a systematic approach {{was taken for}} optimising processing and materials parameters. Four parameters were investigated in more detail: (1) the LSM/YSZ mass ratio of the cathode functional layer, (2) the grain size of LSM powder for the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer, (3) {{the thickness of the}} cathode functional layer and the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer, and (4) the influence of calcination of YSZ powder used for the cathode functional layer. Results from electrochemical measurements performed between 700 and 900 degrees C with H- 2 (3 vol. % H 2 O) as fuel gas and air as the oxidant showed that the performance was the highest using an LSM/YSZ mass ratio of 50 / 50. A further increase of the electrochemical performance was obtained by increasing the grain size of the outer <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer: the highest performance was achieved with non-ground LSM powder. In addition, {{it was found that the}} thickness of the cathode functional layer and <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer also affects the electrochemical performance, whereas no obvious detrimental effects occurred with the different qualities of YSZ powder for the cathode functional layer. The highest performance, i. e. 1. 50 +/- 0. 05 A cm(- 2) at 800 degrees C and 700 mV, was obtained with a cathode functional layer, characterised by an LSM/YSZ mass ratio of 50 / 50, a d(90) of the LSM powder of 1. 0 mu m, non-calcined YSZ powder, and a thickness of about 30 mu m, and a <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer, characterised by d(90) of the LSM powder of 26. 0 mu m (non-ground), and a thickness of 50 - 60 mu m. Also interesting to note is that the use of non-ground LSM for the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> collector layer and non-calcined YSZ powder for the cathode functional layer obviously simplifies the production route of this type of fuel cell.

In this study, it is shown that an external circuit {{consisting of a}} voltage source and a resistor is inevitable in calculating the correct <b>cathode</b> <b>current.</b> Avoiding the external circuit can cause the current to converge (if at all) to a wrong volt-ampere regime. The importance of this external circuit is studied {{by comparing the results}} with those of a model without current-limiting, device.

Additionally, the increase of I-C caused a reduction of the depletion region trap states density of the Ru-Si-O/In-Ga-Zn-O Schottky barrier.
