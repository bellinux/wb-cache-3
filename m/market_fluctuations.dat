5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E

25|$|While {{the sales}} trend has been mostly {{positive}} for Oaxacan alebrijes, it {{is dependent on}} global <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and on tourism to Oaxaca. There was a decline in sales in the late 1980s, possibly due to global market saturation and the dominance of repetitive, unimaginative designs. Sales rose again in the 1990s. Sales fell again in 2001, when tourism from the U.S. fell and fell again precipitously 2006 due to statewide social unrest. It has not fully recovered since.|$|E

40|$|Between {{suppliers}} and manufacturers, {{there exists a}} market demand which is subject to <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation</b> {{and can not be}} precisely forecasted. Under this background, the study aims at the research on the adoption of scientific methods to reduce the impact of <b>market</b> <b>fluctuation</b> upon both sides of supply and demand. In this article, the author solves the problem from two aspects. Firstly, the Grey System Model is applied to precisely predict the market demand. Secondly, a third party warehouse between {{suppliers and}} manufacturers is established to adjust the contradiction between supply and demand. Furthermore, through case verification, it is found that the time of material supply will be decreased from 100 days to about 38 days and the stock value is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, the author suggests that the Grey System Theory should be utilized by suppliers to optimize their approaches of forecasting the market trends and manufacturers’ requiring quantities...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{influential}} {{role that the}} US stock market plays in international finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets that in the short run, shocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most {{of the variation in}} the US stock market. In the long run, the US stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks however play a small role in historical stock <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> at all horizons in the US stock market.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1840s until the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, the cost of slaves had been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the price of cotton was experiencing <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> typical of raw commodities. After the Panic of 1857, the price of cotton fell while the price of slaves continued its steep rise. At the 1858 Southern commercial convention, William L. Yancey of Alabama called for the reopening of the African slave trade. Only the delegates from the states of the Upper South, who profited from the domestic trade, opposed the reopening of the slave trade since they saw it as a potential form of competition. The convention in 1858 wound up voting to recommend the repeal of all laws against slave imports, despite some reservations.|$|E
25|$|Qing China {{followed}} a Confucian-Modernist economic philosophy {{that called for}} strict government intervention in industry {{for the sake of}} preserving societal stability. While the Qing state was not explicitly anti-trade, a perceived lack of need for imports limited pressure on the government to open further ports to international trade. Qing China's rigid merchant hierarchy also blocked efforts to open ports to foreign ships and businesses. Chinese merchants away from the coast wanted to avoid <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations</b> caused by importing foreign goods that would compete with domestic production, while the Hong houses of Canton profited greatly by keeping their city the only entry point for foreign products. The Cohong was made up of between (depending on the politics of Canton) 6 to 10 merchant families.

25|$|As Prof. Okishio himself acknowledged, his {{argument}} {{is based on}} a comparative static analysis. His starting point is an equilibrium growth path of an economy with a given technique. In a given branch of industry, a technical improvement is introduced (in a way similar to what Marx described) and then the new equilibrium growth path is established under the assumption that the new technique is generally adopted by the capitalists of that branch. The result is that even under Marx's assumptions about technical progress, the new equilibrium growth path goes along with a higher rate of profit. However, if one drops the assumption that a capitalist economy moves from one equilibrium to another, this result no longer holds. There is no real evidence that capitalist development spontaneously tends to equilibrium, since there are continuously <b>market</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> mismatches of supply and demand, and periodic economic crises. In addition perfect competition does not exist, and corporations may actively try to block competitors in their markets (e.g. European Union Microsoft competition case).|$|E
