Termination {{of the bus}} is essential for good signal quality. Furthermore, the bitstream is continuous, requiring good re-synchronization to the bit stream. Data frames are 1600 bits long with the header portion of the frame consisting of parameters such as range, tilt, gain, status, etc. The data portion is organized into 512 range-bits per scan angle value. Each range bit contains a color value to indicate the intensity at that position. Settings for the ARINC 708 system is typically controlled using an ARINC 429 interface.
