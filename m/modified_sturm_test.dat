40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: CO 2 - {{evolution}} tests (OECD 301 -B), {{formerly known}} as modified Sturm tests, are commonly used for evaluation of the biodegradation potential of non-volatile molecules through measurement of the carbon dioxide produced. Extension of the <b>modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test</b> to evaluation of the toxicity of veterinary antibiotics, tetracycline and tylosine, on the biological treatment of swine wastewater was examined in this work. RESULTS: <b>Modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test</b> results highlighted the care which {{should be given to}} the description of the operational parameters (matrix and inoculum source). Using lab-scale inoculum, it was shown that the toxicity threshold of tetracycline (7 - 10 mg L− 1 total organic carbon (TOC)) was higher than that of tylosine (4 - 5 mg L− 1 TOC). Tylosine was found to be slightly biodegradable while total non-biodegradability was found for tetracycline. CONCLUSION: The higher tetracycline biodegradability {{may be related to the}} molecular conformation of tetracycline and tylosine antibiotics, the former is constituted of four benzoic cycles hardly breakable, while tylosine is constituted of a central structure with attached glycosidic-like fragments which might easily be biologically degraded. The antibiotic inhibitory effect was lower using membrane bioreactor sludge instead of lab-scale pilot sludge, in agreement with the lower resistance compared with pilot scale or industrial scale sludge.

40|$|For {{predicting}} the environmental {{fate of a}} chemical a knowledge of its biodegradability is essential. Several kinds of tests, standardized by the OECD and EEC for the determination of ultimate biodegradability (mineralization), are available. The degradation is determined by nonspecific analyses such as the measurement of DOC (e. g. modified OECD screening test), microbial oxygen uptake (modified MITI test; manometric respirometry test) or the microbial release of COsub 2 (<b>modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test).</b> For testing the biodegradability of two stroke engine oils a special test {{was developed by the}} CEC (Co-Ordination European Council) : the CEC L- 33 -T- 82. In this test the criterion for biodegradability is the elimination of the characteristic CHsub 3 CHsub 2 - groups as determined by IR-spectroscopy. Comparative studies with three synthetic lubricant base stocks revealed that significant differences may occur for this substance class. The degradation of the three substances was 100 percent in the CEC-te st, whereas in the manometric respirometry test degradation levels below 40 percent were obtained; in the <b>modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test</b> the degradation was between 44 and 85 percent. In the manometric respirometry test no substance fulfilled the criterion of ready biodegradability, whereas all three substances reached the pass level in the CEC- test. Results obtained in the CEC-test and in mineralization tests should be in good agreement when no significant formation of microbial biomass and no formation of hydrophilic metabolites takes place. Both parameter contribute to a high percentage of biodegradation in the CEC-test, but low apparent biodegradability in tests for ultimate biodegradability...|$|E
40|$|The aquatic {{biodegradability}} {{of cellulose}} and cellulose acetate with degrees of substitution (d. s.) {{in the range}} of 1. 5 to 3. 0, was compared with the mineralization under laboratory controlled composting conditions. In line with previous observations, it was found that cellulose acetates with d. s. ≤ 2. 5 were readily mineralized to CO 2 in the controlled composting test. The degradation rate was clearly affected by the degree of substitution (d. s. 1. 5 > d. s. 2. 5 > d. s. 3. 0). Surprisingly, however, biodegradation of cellulose acetate materials was not observed in the aquatic <b>Sturm</b> <b>test.</b> Modifications of the pH and the inoculum source in an attempt to improve the activity of fungi and actinomycetes in the aquatic environment, did not increase CO 2 -evolution.

40|$|Investigation of the {{biodegradability}} {{of water}} soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) based blown films {{was carried out}} under different lab-scale environmental conditions. In particular respirometric tests were utilized in order to evaluate the biodegradability of PVA films in composting, in <b>modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test</b> and in soil burial simulation tests. Several microbial inocula present in river water, mature compost, forest and farm soils as well as sewage sludge from municipal and paper mill wastewater treatments plants were utilized for the relevant tests. A mixed PVA-degrading microbial culture was obtained by a common enrichment procedure by using sewage sludge from paper mill as inoculum; this culture was tentatively utilized for the isolation of single PVA-degrading microorganisms. As a first result we can stress that significant biodegradation extent in fairly low incubation time can be obtained only {{in the presence of}} acclimated microbial populations such as those deriving from paper mill sewage sludge, in liquid cultures. Nevertheless separation of single degrading microbial species was impossible most likely due to the establishment of symbiotic or commensal interactions between the single components of the PVA-degrading mixed cultures. On the other hand, limited mineralization rates were recorded in solid cultures in the presence of soil or compost. Finally, a mechanism of degradation of polymer chains unlike random or unzipping was suggested in the presence of either PVA-degrading mixed culture and its filtrate by means of viscometric determinations of molecular weight within the time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{biodegradation}} of 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) and bisphenol A (BPA) {{was compared}} to that of a reference pollutant, sodium benzoate (SB), known for its high biodegradability. The biodegradation was measured using the Sturm test (ISO 9439 <b>modified</b> <b>Sturm</b> <b>test).</b> The susceptibility of the target pollutants to be degraded by microorganisms of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was evaluated by the production of carbon dioxide (CO,). Sorption experiments onto inactivated sludge were carried out to assess the contribution of sorption in E 2 and BPA removal during biological treatment in a WWTP. E 2 was more adsorbed than BPA onto inactivated sludge, probably making it less accessible to assimilation by microorganisms. In fact, E 2 was less biodegradable than BPA with 66 % and 74 % of theoretical CO 2 formation (Th-CO 2) in 28 days, respectively. However, E 2 showed faster biodegradation than BPA due to the shorter adaptation time of the microorganisms to start the assimilation. Final concentrations were measured and revealed that, under Sturm test conditions, E 2 was totally removed from the aqueous phase while some traces of BPA were detected. This result could be explained by the lower adsorbability of BPA observed in adsorption experiments onto inactivated sludge. To investigate competition in a bi-component solution, Sturm tests were carried out with BPA/SB and E 2 /SB. Moreover, the biodegradation curves obtained did not indicate a toxicity of the target compounds towards microorganisms, which rapidly degraded SB. In the case of BPA/SB, an inflection in the curve confirmed the adaptation time of 4 - 5 days for BPA to be degraded...|$|E

Low density polyethylene (LOPE) {{is one of the major}} sources of environmental pollution. In the present study, the pieces of LOPE plastic bags were buried in soil and observed microscopically after 10 months. Fungal strains found attached on the surface of LOPE plastic pieces were identified as Fusarium sp. AF 4, Aspergillus terreus AF 5 and Penicillium sp. AF 6. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed some mechanical damage or erosions on the surface of LOPE pieces incubated with Fusarium sp. AF 4. Biodegradation of LOPE was determined by <b>Sturm</b> <b>test,</b> and it was found that in case of test the total amount of C 02 produced was 1. 85 g/l and in control it was 1. 45 g/l.

Further the possibility of accelerating the biodegradation process by exposing LOPE pieces to UV radiation and treating with nitric acid before microbial treatment. FTIR analysis of the pretreated PE pieces showed some breakdown indicated by the change in spectra at the wavelength 1710 cm- 1 and 831 cm- 1 which decreased to 1708 cm- 1 and 830 cm- 1.

Biodegradation of polystyrene is very slow in natural environmentand it persists for {{longer period of time}} as solid waste. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the biodegradation process of polystyrene and explore the ways to enhance the biodegradation process. Soil burial method was used to isolate microorganisms. The plastic films recovered from soil after 8 months were incubated on mineral salts media (MSM) agar plates for 3 months to get the growth of only those microorganisms that were able to grow with polystyrene for longer time. Six fungal and five bacterial stains were isolated and identified. Three fungal isolates were selected on the basis ofbiodegradability of polystyrene films in shake flask transformation experiments analysed by Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The selected fungal strains were characterized taxonomically on the basis of sequence homology of conserved regions of 18 S rRNA and were identified as Rhizopus oryzae NA 1, Aspergillus terreus NA 2 and Phanerochaete chrysosporium NA 3. The 18 S rRNA sequences werredeposited in NCBI database with accession numbers in Genbank FJ 654430, FJ 654431 and FJ 654433 for strain NA 1, NA 2, NA 3 respectively. The biodegradation of polystyrene was studied by CO 2 evolution <b>test</b> (<b>Sturm</b> <b>test)</b> all the isolated showed higher CO 2 levels in the test as compared to control showing effective mineralization of polystyrene. Biodegradation studies in liquid media with polystyrene films, expanded polystyrene (EPS) films and beads were conducted in the static and shake flask (120 rpm) fermentation experiments at 30 ºC. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis showed that the fungal isolates were able to establish mycelia on the polymer surface and maximum growth was observed in glucose added mineral salts media. FTIR spectra of the treated films showed increase in absorption spectra around 536 cm- 1, 748 cm- 1 (mono substituted aromatic compound), 1026 cm- 1, 1450 cm- 1, 1492 cm- 1 (C=C stretching vibration of aromatic compounds), 2916 cm- 1, 3400 cm- 1 (aryl-H stretching vibrations). Major changes were observed in 1000 - 1700 cm- 1 and 3400 cm- 1 region which indicated depolymerisation and degradation into monomers. The degradation products of the polystyrene and expanded polystyrene were analysed by HPLC. 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -ethandiol, 2 -phenylethanol and phenyacetaldehyde and styrene oxide, which were oxidation degradation products of monomer styrene, were detected in most of the cases. 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -ethandiol was detected with highesttconcentration of 21. 3 ppm in media sample of polystyrene incubated with A. terreus NA 2 in shake flask and 34. 7 ppm with P. chrysosporium NA 3 in static conditions. Polystyrene films were given pretreatment of UV irradiation (1 - 2 hr. at &# 955; 254 nm) and heat for 1 hour) and then biodegradation was studied. UV pretreatment of 2 hours showed enhancing effect on biodegradation by fungal isolates indicated a decrease of weight average molecular weight in the treated samples. Heat pretreatments did not show enhancing effect on biodegradation except P. chrysosporium NA 3 treatment of heat pretreated polystyrene films. Enhancing effect of glucose on biodegradaon of polystyrene films was observed in FTIR spectral analysis, when glucose was used as additional carbon source in mineral salts mediaThe soil buried films of polystyrene for six months showed very significant degradation in FTIR and GPC analysis.

30|$|Polyurethane (PUR) was {{prepared}} through polyaddition of diisocynate. The urethane bond involves a chain linkage of large molecular weight polymers (~ 200 {{as well as}} 6000). These large molecular weight polymers are polyether PUR and polyester PUR susceptible to microbial degradation (Shimao 2001). Polyethylene adipate (PEA) {{also serves as a}} polymer that comprises urethane bonding, which is originally a pre-polymer of PUR (Bhardwaj et al. 2012 b). Ureases, esterases, proteases and lipases were classified for PUR hydrolysis via ester bond cleavage. Trichoderma sp. utilized the PUR as a substrate by producing ureases. Similarly, Aspergillus terreus and Chaetomium globosum were observed for the production of urethane and esterase that hydrolyzed the PUR (Bhardwaj et al. 2012 b; Howard 2012). Loredo-Trevino et al. (2011) studied 22 fungal strains and found maximum urease activity in most of thm (95 %), while the enzymatic activity of laccase, esterase and protease was observed in 36, 50 and 86 % strains, respectively. Monooxygenase cleaves the ether linkages of the polymer of polyether. Acetaldehyde forms during ether linkage conversion with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Fusarium solani and Candida ethanolica were identified as dominant species on the surface of polyurethanes (Schink et al. 1992; Zafar et al. 2013). Curvularia senegalensis showed more degrading activity as compared to others (Howard 2002). Proteolytic enzymes, i.e., urease and papain, were found to degrade polyurethane (medical polyester) (Bhardwaj et al. 2012 b). In addition to papain, subtilisin was also reported for its involvement in polyurethanes degradation (Chandra and Rustgi 1998). The growth of C. acidovorans was observed on a PUR substrate and exploited as nitrogen and sole carbon; the extracellular membrane bound enzymes have a key role in PUR hydrolysis (Howard 2012). C. acidovorans TB- 35 led to the biodegradation of polyester PUR and diethylene glycol and adipic acid were found as degraded products. Cell bound enzymes are responsible for PUR degradation and isolated from C. acidovorans. The gene for such enzymes encodes 548 amino acid protein and contains hydrophobic domains for polymer surface attachment, the catalytic domain, lipase box and signal sequence. In previous studies, bacterial species were less reported for PUR degradation in comparison to fungi, e.g., Arthrographis kalrae, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, Emericella, Lichthemia, Fusarium solanii, Thermomyces, Corynebacterium sp., Neonectria, Plectosphaerella, Phoma, Nectria, Alternaria and P. aeruginosa, and bacteria from genera Bacillus and Comamonas also served as polyurethanes degrader (Shimao 2001; Chandra and Rustgi 1998; Flavel et al. 2006; Zafar 2013; Akutsu et al. 1998; Bhardwaj et al. 2012 b). Shah et al. (2008 a) isolated the bacteria from soil samples and examined them for polyurethane degradation. Isolates were characterized and identified Bacillus sp. AF 8, Pseudomonas sp. AF 9, Micrococcus sp. 10, Arthrobacter sp. AF 11, and Corynebacterium sp. AF 12. All the isolates exploited PUR as carbon source, and degradation was determined via esterase activity and CO 2 estimation through the <b>Sturm</b> <b>test,</b> and further structural and chemical changes were examined by means of SEM and FT-IR analysis, respectively. Upreti and Srivastava (2003) observed the growth of A. foetidus on polyurethane and investigated the PUR biodegradation by means of reduction in its tensile strength and tensile modulus. Ma and Wong (2013) studied the esterase activity of A. flavus for polyester polyurethanes degradation. Ma and Wong (2013) exploited esterase genes from A. flavus transfer to the P. pastoris for mass production of esterase; it may also speed up the PUR degradation rate as compared to A. flavus. Genes pueA and pueB played an extreme role in PUR degradation, as determined by conducting different gene silencing and cloning analyses with P. chlororaphis and E. coli (Howard 2012). These genes are located along with the cluster of the ABC transporter gene and seven open reading frames. According to gene silencing experiments, Howard et al. (2007) suggested pueA {{played a significant role in}} increasing the cellular density, which enhanced the PUR degradation. Enzymatic secretion of these enzymes followed the Type I secretion system that employed C-terminal hydrophobic secretion signals and glycine-rich RTX motifs, which played the critical role in stabilizing the Ca 2 + roll structure. The exact mechanism of the ion roll structure is contentious; it may help with proper alignment of the signal and their secretion (Howard 2012). Gene pueA cloned from the P. chlororaphis to E. coli is encoded for the extracellular enzyme that is secreted from the cloned E. coli cell. The recombinant product of pueA showed similarity with the Group I lipases. Group I lipases and serine hydrolases are widely distributed PUR hydrolyzing enzymes that form a serine triad structure in addition to histidine and aspartate/glutamate (Howard 2012). Stern and Howard (2000) exploited the pT 7 - 6 vector for subcloning the gene transfer that encoded a 65  kDa protein and displayed serine hydrolase characteristics. Pestalotiopsis microspora is another instance of the production of serine hydrolase with PUR exploited as the carbon source (Bhardwaj et al. 2012 b). Howard (2012) isolated soil microorganism P 7, which was identified as Acinetobacter gerneri by 16 S rRNA sequencing and reported for polyurethane degradation. Howard (2012) characterized and determined the 66 -kDa enzymes involved in polyurethane hydrolysis and enhanced substrate specificity was increased with of p-nitrophenylpropanate, while ethylenediamine-tetra acetic acid and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride showed a negative effect by inhibiting the enzyme activity. Polyurethanase (48  kDa) encoding genes were reported in E. coli for successfully cloning and expression.|$|R
