[...] In a study where experimental manipulations were used to motivate subjects to engage in convergent or divergent thinking when presented with either majority or minority support for persuasive arguments, a pattern emerged under the {{convergent thinking}} condition where majority support produced <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> on the focal issue. Conversely, minority support for the argument {{had no effect on}} the subjects. The convergent thinkers are too focused with selecting the best answer that they fail to appropriately evaluate minority opinion and could end up dismissing accurate solutions.|$|E
50|$|His {{results showed}} that the impact of message framing upon attitudes was moderated by the ease of {{imagination}} and clearly supported the congruency hypothesis for different kinds of health behavior. Finding that, negatively framed messages led to <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> when the recipients of these messages could easily imagine the relevant symptoms. Ease of imagination thus facilitates persuasion when messages emphasize potential health risks. A positive framing however, leads to <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> when symptom imagination was rather difficult.|$|E

This study showed that Danish vocational school students self-reported 23.6 (SD[*]=[*] 16.6) minutes of PA per day. Only 18.3 % of male students and 13.3 % of female students self-reported 45  min of PA per day as required by the vocational school reform. This study also showed that Danish vocational school students had a relatively <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> to implementing PA in school.

40|$|The resource-based view {{identifies}} {{a number}} of factors that may influence employees’ informal learning. In a cross-sectional survey of 113 German employees in the energy sector, we examined {{a number of}} potential predictors of informal learning and a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> informal learning <b>attitude.</b> The results showed that proactive help-seeking and professional self-efficacy were positive predictors of informal learning. Employees who were older, who enjoyed learning, sought help and were self-efficacious learners had a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards formal learning. Employees who had a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> about informal learning rated organisational learning provisions as less important, potentially due to being proactive help-seekers. Managers rated organisational learning resources as less important than non-managerial employees. However, managers also reported higher professional self-efficacy. These circumstances may also influence their decision-making regarding the need to provide learning resources to others in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– This paper employs {{theories}} of experiential learning to examine why some entrepreneurs {{have developed a}} <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards failures compared to others. Design/methodology/approach– The paper conducts statistical analysis on a sample of 231 Swedish entrepreneurs that have started new independent firms in 2004. Findings– The empirical findings support the guiding proposition that more favourable attitudes towards failure could be learned through entrepreneurs' life and work. The results suggest that previous start up experience is strongly associated with a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards failure. The paper also finds that experience from closing down a business {{is associated with a}} <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards failure. In addition, a more fine‐grained analysis suggests that experience from closing down a business due to reasons of poor performance is a highly valuable source of learning while closure due to more personal reasons does not lead to the same result. Research limitations/implications– In sum, the findings add to the knowledge of why some entrepreneurs have a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards failure compared to others. It also provides some general implications for the understanding of entrepreneurial learning as an experiential process. Practical implications– A <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward failure might be a significant asset for entrepreneurs as it might help them to deal with and learn from their mistakes and to move forward. The results indicate that the attitudes toward failure are not homogeneous among entrepreneurs. Rather, this attitude can, at least to some degree, be influenced due to new experiences and new information. Originality/value– The paper provides novel insights with regard to the role that critical career experiences can play for the development of entrepreneurs' attitudes towards failure...|$|R

50|$|This {{term was}} first {{proposed}} in the early 1970s by psychologist Lee Ross following an experiment he conducted with Edward E. Jones and Victor Harris in 1967. In this study, participants were instructed to read two essays; one expressed pro-Castro views, and the other expressed anti-Castro views. Participants {{were then asked to}} report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, rather than their own free will, participants continued to express <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, providing evidence of what was later coined the fundamental attribution error.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interactive}} effects of chief executive officer (CEO) age and CEO attitudes toward younger and older employees on organisational age cultures. Data was collected from 66 CEOs of small and medium-sized businesses and 274 employees. Results were consistent with expectations based on organisational culture and upper echelons theories. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for younger employees was negative for CEOs with a less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward younger employees and positive for those with a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward younger employees. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for older employees was positive for CEOs with a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward older employees and non-significant for those with a less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward older employees. The findings provide initial support for the existence of organisational age cultures, suggesting that these cultures can be predicted by the interplay of CEO age and age-related attitudes...|$|R
