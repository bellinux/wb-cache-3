40|$|Detection of a {{deterministic}} signal in correlated Gaussian {{noise in}} large-scale sensor networks is considered. In contrast to existing works which assume that each sensor uses a dedicated channel for transmission, we explore {{the possibility of}} employing a shared multiple access channel (MAC) for detection, which significantly reduces the bandwidth requirement, or the detection delay. We assume that sensors transmit local decisions based on their respective local observations and a <b>mapping</b> <b>rule</b> through a MAC subject to an average power constraint. We consider two scenarios {{depending on whether the}} sensors have intelligence or not, and propose one <b>mapping</b> <b>rule</b> for each scenario. We show that while detection over a parallel access channel (PAC) always results in a loss in error exponent, the asymptotic performance of optimal centralized detection can be achieved with the first MAC <b>mapping</b> <b>rule</b> for intelligent sensors. For dumb sensors, the second MAC <b>mapping</b> <b>rule</b> has advantage in terms of energy efficiency compared with detection over PAC in certain applications.

Normally, information is lost during the transformation of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to relational tables (Details {{can be found in}} object-relational impedance mismatch) and has to be reverse engineered.

Early approaches used a fixed amount of manually created <b>mapping</b> <b>rules</b> to refine the 1:1 mapping. More elaborate methods are employing heuristics or learning algorithms to induce schematic information (methods overlap with ontology learning). While some approaches try to extract the information from the structure inherent in the SQL schema (analysing e.g. foreign keys), others analyse the content and the values in the tables to create conceptual hierarchies (e.g. a columns with few values are candidates for becoming categories). The second direction tries to map the schema and its contents to a pre-existing domain ontology (see also: ontology alignment). Often, however, a suitable domain ontology does not exist and has to be created first.|$|E
