5000|$|Posting or postadh (Scottish Gaelic) was {{a process}} in washing clothes {{formerly}} used in Scotland. It means to trample with the feet, or the act of trampling or treading. In scouring woollen clothing, blankets or coarse linen, when {{the strength of the}} arms and <b>manual</b> <b>friction</b> are found insufficient, Highland women put them in a [...] with a prop - or quantity of water, then, with petticoats tucked up, they commence the operation of posting, which they continue until every part of the clothes receives an effectual cleansing. When three women are employed, one commonly tramps in the middle, and the other two tramp around her.|$|E
40|$|A <b>manual</b> <b>friction</b> clutch {{has been}} {{modified}} by applying a dc-motor actuator, {{such that the}} clutch can be operated electronically. In order for this electro-mechanical clutch suits for CVT applications, the fundamental research to study the characterisation of the clutch needs to be carried out. This study focused on the clutch dynamic behaviours, especially during the engagement and disengagement processes when the clutch was operated manually in open loop system without any control strategy applied to it. The observed parameters were torques, speeds and powers of both engine and output clutch. The experimental results show that during engagement process, small overshoot occurred at output clutch speed, but significant overshoots occurred at input and output torque as well as power. The output torque overshoot was not only directly proportional to the initial engine speed but also inversely proportional to the output load torque...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} weight {{reduction}} in aircrafts has promoted {{the employment of}} hybrid materials such as Fiber Metal Laminates (FML) in the fuselage. Since thin aluminum foils can only be produced in limited width by the available rolling process, several layers of metal must be overlapped, forming a so-called splicing, to build large fuselage structures increasing weight and manufacturing costs due to its <b>manual</b> assembly. <b>Friction</b> Stir Welding (FSW) represents a plausible alternative for avoiding splicing by joining the aluminum foils to obtain a wider metal sheet configuration. In this study, tomographic investigations of post-mortem fatigue and in-situ tensile tests were carried out for fiber metal laminates (FML) containing 3 layers of friction stir welded AlMgSc AA 5024 alloy foil and 2 layer of {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP). The aim of these investigations is to identify the damage mechanisms and sequence of damage during quasi static and fatigue loading conditions of the FML as well as to determine microstructural features responsible for tensile and fatigue damage. The tensile tests were carried out using the stop/go technique. The specimen were loaded until a pre-determined stress level and held. Examination of the radiographies taken during the loading period show that delamination is first observed at the interface between the welding flash of the outset aluminum thin foil and the GFRP-layer normal to the loading direction As the load increases cracking initiates and propagates within the polymer matrix. The aluminum sheets, then, abruptly fail without much evidence of bulk deformation. The FML containing friction stir welds only reach 65...|$|R
