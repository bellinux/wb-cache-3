5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court.

After <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifteen</b> years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children.

5|$|He {{was born}} Nils Johan Nilsen to a Norwegian family in Seljeskog in Salangen on 3 June 1894, {{as the oldest}} of six children. As a child, Nelsen was an active skier and ski jumper, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifteen</b> ski jumps located in the area. In 1913, his family emigrated to Big Eddy near Revelstoke. Once in Canada, he anglicized his name. His brother, Ivind Nilsen was also a {{champion}} ski jumper, and became among other things Boy's World Champion in 1922. Ivind, who chose not to anglicize his last name, {{was known for his}} supreme style, while Nels was better known for his length. Nelsen married Emma Pickard, with whom he had ten children. Except for a brief period as a ski instructor, he worked as a brakeman and conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose flexibility made it easer to participate in tournaments. He moved to North Vancouver where he raised his family.|$|E

5|$|Domitian was {{declared}} emperor by the Praetorian Guard {{the day after}} Titus' death, commencing a reign which lasted <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifteen</b> yearslonger than any man who had governed Rome since Tiberius. Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building programme to restore the damaged city of Rome. In Britain, Gnaeus Julius Agricola expanded the Roman Empire as far as modern day Scotland, but in Dacia, Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory {{in the war against}} the Dacians. On September 18, 96, Domitian was assassinated by court officials, and with him the Flavian dynasty came to an end. The same day, he was succeeded by his friend and advisor Nerva, who founded the long-lasting Nervan-Antonian dynasty. Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, with which he had a notoriously difficult relationship throughout his reign. Senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories after his death, propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern history has rejected these views, instead characterising Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political programme provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's.|$|E
