These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins soluble in fat can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due {{to the lack of}} long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins</b> was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an acute toxicity.

Seawater samples (n = 256) from around Europe were collected by the consortia of an EU project MIcroarrays for the Detection of Toxic Algae (MIDTAL) and evaluated using each method. A simple sample preparation procedure was developed which involved lysing and releasing the toxins from the algal cells with glass beads followed by centrifugation and filtering the extract before testing for <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins</b> by both multi-SPR and ELISA. Method detection limits based on IC 20 values for PSP, okadaic acid and domoic acid toxins were 0. 82, 0. 36 and 1. 66 ng/ml, respectively, for the prototype multiplex SPR biosensor. Evaluation by SPR for seawater samples has shown that 47, 59 and 61 % of total seawater samples tested positive (result greater than the IC 20) for PSP, okadaic acid (and analogues) and domoic acid toxins, respectively.

40|$|The first {{national}} survey of Australian wild-caught abalone was conducted between September 2012 and December 2013.

Abalone (n = 190) were collected from 68 abalone-fishing blocks for which the combined annual harvest accounts for 80 % of Australian production. Concurrent seawater samples were collected and enumerated for potentially toxic phytoplankton. The foot and viscera tissues of each abalone sample were analyzed separately for PSTs, ASTs, and DSTs. No samples (abalone foot or viscera) contained toxins at levels exceeding the <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxin</b> limits stipulated by Codex. The resulting prevalence estimate suggests that less than 1. 6 % of the commercially caught wild abalone population in Australia were contaminated with marine biotoxins at levels above the regulatory limit during the survey period. ASTs were detected at very low (trace) levels in the foot and viscera tissue of four and three abalone samples, respectively. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported detection of domoic acid in Australian abalone. PSTs also were detected at very low levels in 17 samples of abalone foot tissue and 6 samples of abalone viscera. The association between the low levels of ASTs and PSTs detected in abalone and the presence of potential toxin-producing phytoplankton in seawater samples was weak. DSTs were not detected in any abalone despite the detection of very low levels of DST-producing phytoplankton in a small number (9 of 77) of seawater samples. The results of this survey should be useful for public health risk assessments and provide additional evidence that the prevalence of marine biotoxins in Australian wild-caught abalone is very low.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the presence of potential toxic phytoplankton species and <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins</b> in Dutch production waters over the last decade, and to analyse the relationship between toxin levels and abundance of possible causative phytoplankton species. The results of the monitoring programme of the period 1999 - 2009 were used. The presence of Alexandrium spp. were negligible, but Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and phytoplankton causing diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP toxin-producing phytoplankton) were present in nearly all three main production areas and years. The main DSP toxin-producing species was Dinophysis acuminata followed by D. rotundata and Prorocentrum lima. Toxins causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) were present in only a few individual shellfish samples, all at low levels. At the end of 2002, an episode of DSP toxicity was recorded, based on the rat bioassay results. Of the samples that were chemically analysed for DSP toxins in 2007 and 2008, about half of the samples in 2007 contained these toxins, although levels were low and no positive results were obtained using the rat bioassay. There was a slight positive correlation between concentrations of DSP toxin-producing phytoplankton and levels of DSP toxins in 2007. Increased DSP toxin levels were found up to 5 weeks after the peak in DSP toxin-producing phytoplankton. This positive, but weak, relationship needs to be confirmed in future research using more samples and chemical methods to quantify the presence of DSP toxins.

40|$|Abstract: Domoic acid is a <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxin</b> {{associated}} with harmful algal blooms {{and is the}} causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning in marine animals and humans. It is also an excitatory amino acid analog to glutamate and kainic acid which acts through glutamate receptors eliciting a very rapid and potent neurotoxic response. The hippocampus, among other brain regions, {{has been identified as}} a specific target site having high sensitivity to DOM toxicity. Histopathology evidence indicates that in addition to neurons, the astrocytes were also injured. Electron microscopy data reported in this study further supports the light microscopy findings. Furthermore, the effect of DOM was confirmed by culturing primary astrocytes from the hippocampus and the brain stem and subsequently exposing them to domoic acid. The RNA was extracted and used for biomarker analysis. The biomarker analysis was done for the early response genes including c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, Hsp- 72; specific marker for the astrocytes- GFAP and the glutamate receptors including GluR 2, NMDAR 1, NM-DAR 2 A and B.

Exposure to this biotoxin led to a 6. 67 -fold increase in adult female strandings in 2000, and a 5. 44 -fold increase in adult female deaths in 2006, relative to strandings and deaths of adult female not affected by domoic acid. Domoic acid cases have occurred annually since 1998 (except for 1999) between April and August, with clusters centered primarily at Pismo Beach (San Luis Obispo County), as well as at other beaches in San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Orange, and San Diego counties. The larger ecological and population level implications of increased domoic acid strandings and deaths, particularly among adult female sea lions, warrant further attention and need to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} if {{and to what}} extent murine stem cell-derived beating cardiomyocytes within embryoid bodies {{can be used as a}} broad screening in vitro assay for neurotoxicity testing, replacing for example in vivo tests for marine neurotoxins. Effect of nine model compounds, acting on either the Na+, K+, or Ca 2 + channels or the Na+/K+ ATP-ase pump, on the beating was assessed. Diphenhydramine, veratridine, isradipine, verapamil and ouabain induced specific beating arrests that were reversible and none of the concentrations tested induced cytotoxicity. Three K+ channel blockers, amiodarone, clofilium and sematilide, and the Na+/K+ ATPase pump inhibitor digoxin had no specific effect on the beating. In addition, two marine neurotoxins i. e. saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin elicited specific beating arrests in cardiomyocytes. Comparison of the results obtained with cardiomyocytes to those obtained with the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay revealed that the cardiomyocytes were generally somewhat more sensitive for the model compounds affecting Na+ and Ca 2 + channels, but less sensitive for the compounds affecting K+ channels. The stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were not as sensitive as the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay for saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that the murine stem cell-derived beating cardiomyocytes provide a sensitive model for detection of specific neurotoxins and that the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay may be a more promising cell-based assay for the screening of <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxin...</b>|$|E
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method is {{proposed for the}} sensitive, specific and direct detection of yessotoxin and its analogues, the <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins</b> associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occurring in North Adriatic Sea since 1995. The LC-MS method provided a detection limit of 70 pg for yessotoxin in full scan mode and it was applied to determine toxic profile {{of a number of}} extracts or partially purified fractions of toxic mussels collected along Emilia Romagna coasts (Italy) in the period 1995 - 1999. Detection of a desulfo-yessotoxin derivative from Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in 1998 is also reported...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{people around}} the world depend on the marine environment, for its nutritional, recreational, and general {{economic}} value. For many years, a notable increase has been observed in the number of cases of severe intoxication, through the consumption of contaminated seafood and through external exposure. While dinoflagellates and diatoms are considered the main source of <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins,</b> there is also growing evidence that certain groups of marine cyanobacteria are likely to produce various toxins with potential harmful effects on humans, especially in cases of massive proliferation. Some of the recent findings that support this hypothesis are summarized in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} potentially toxic microalgae in the Mediterranean {{area is a}} mat- ter of great concern. Since {{the end of the}} last century, microalgae of the genus Ostreopsis have been detected more and more frequently in the Italian coastal waters. The presence of Ostreopsis spp. has been accompanied by the presence of previously undetected <b>marine</b> <b>biotoxins</b> (palytoxins) into the ecosystem with the increased possibility of human exposure. In response to the urgent need for toxicity characterization of palytoxin and its congeners, an integrated study encompassing both in vitro and in vivo methods was performed...|$|R
