5|$|Szabó {{emphasizes}} iconography in his films, {{insofar as}} {{he tends to}} invest certain objects and places with symbolic meaning.

5|$|Josquin's {{earliest}} chansons {{were probably}} composed in northern Europe, {{under the influence}} of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the formes fixes– the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade– instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sacred works. He {{was one of the first}} composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
