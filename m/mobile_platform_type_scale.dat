40|$|Part 1 : ConferenceInternational audienceThe {{relevance}} of enabling mobile access to business enterprise information systems for experts {{working in the}} field has grown significantly in the last years due to the increasing availability of smartphones; the shipment of smartphones exceeded that of personal computers in 2011. However, the screen sizes and display resolutions of different devices vary to a large degree, along with different aspect ratios and the complexity of mobile tasks. These obstacles are a major challenge for software developers, especially when they try to reach the largest possible audience and develop for multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> or device <b>types.</b> On the other side, the end users’ expectations regarding the usability of the applications are increasing. Consequently, for a successful mobile application the user interface needs to be well-designed, thus justifying research to overcome these obstacles. In this paper, we report on experiences during an industrial project on building user interfaces for database access to a business enterprise information system for professionals in the field. We discuss our systematic analysis of standards and conventions for design of user interfaces for various <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms,</b> as well as scaling methods operational on different physical screen sizes.

40|$|The usage {{possibilities}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> and smart phones are increasing rapidly as they {{provide support for}} better processors, sensors and communications capabilities.

40|$|A mobile {{manipulator}} is {{a robotic}} arm {{mounted on a}} robotic <b>mobile</b> <b>platform.</b> In such a system, the degrees of freedom of the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> are combined {{with that of the}} manipulator. As a result, the workspace of the manipulator is substantially extended. A mobile manipulator has two trajectories: the end-effector trajectory and the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> trajectory. Typically, the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> trajectory is not defined and is determined through inverse kinematics. But in some applications it is important to follow a specified <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> trajectory. The main focus of this work is to determine the inverse kinematics of a mobile manipulator to follow the specified end-effector and <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> trajectories, especially when both trajectories cannot be exactly followed simultaneously due to physical limitations. Two new control algorithms are developed to solve this problem. In the first control algorithm, three joint-dependent control variables (spherical coordinates D, α and β) are introduced to define the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> trajectory in relation to the end-effector trajectory and vice versa. This allows direct control of the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> motion relative to the end-effector. Singularity-robust and task-priority inverse kinematics with gradient projection method is used to find best possible least-square solutions for the dual-trajectory tracking while maximizing the whole system manipulability. MATLAB Simulated Planar Mobile Manipulation is used to test and optimize the proposed control system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control system in following the two trajectories as much as possible while optimizing the whole system manipulability measure. The second new inverse kinematics algorithm is introduced when the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> motion is restricted to stay on a specified virtual or physical track. The control scheme allows xii the mobile manipulator to follow the desired end-effector trajectory while keeping the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> on a specified track. The <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> is moved along a track to position the arm at a pose that facilitates the end-effector task. The translation of the redundant mobile manipulator over the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> track is determined by combining the mobility of the platform and the manipulation of the redundant arm in a single control system. The <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> is allowed to move forward and backward with different velocities along its track to enable the end-effector in following its trajectory. MATLAB simulated 5 DoF redundant planar mobile manipulator is used to implement and test the proposed control algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control system in adjusting the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> translations along its track to allow the arm to follow its own trajectory with high manipulability. Both control algorithms are implemented on MATLAB simulated wheelchair mounted robotic arm system (WMRA-II). These control algorithms are also implemented on real the WMRA-II hardware. In order to facilitate mobile manipulation, a control motion scheme is proposed to detect and correct the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> pose estimation error using computer vision algorithm. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is used to register two consecutive Microsoft Kinect camera views. Two local transformation matrices i. e., Encoder and ICP transformation matrices, are fused using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to filter the encoder pose estimation error. VICON motion analysis system is used to capture the ground truth of the <b>mobile</b> <b>platform.</b> Real time implementation results show significant improvement in platform pose estimation.
