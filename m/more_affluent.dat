5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., is {{concentrated}} in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5% of city blocks accounted for over one-quarter of the District's total crime. The <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city. Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.|$|E

5|$|The {{payment of}} death duties and the {{difficulty}} of maintaining a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family was living in a Regency-style house converted from the housing that had been provided for the garden and stable staff in <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> times.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Towson United Methodist Church {{is a large}} United Methodist Church in the {{historic}} Baltimore County, Maryland suburb of Towson. Its past, rooted in 19th century America, and subsequent growth in the two centuries since then, have closely paralleled the nation's political and sociological trends. It was a congregation split asunder in 1861 {{on the eve of}} the American Civil War in a border state of divided loyalties, which eventually reunited and built a church in the post-World War II era of the 1950s, a time of reconciliation and rapid growth by mainline Protestant denominations, especially in the <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> suburbs.|$|E
40|$|Most US {{counties}} undergoing {{rapid population}} increases rely on traditional land preservation techniques (zoning, direct purchase, development regulations) to control {{land use and}} on public meetings {{to communicate with the}} public. Yet some of these rapidly growing counties also use tax incentives, conservation easements, and other innovative preservation methods; they also use the mass media to communicate. These innovative counties tend to be <b>more</b> populous, <b>affluent,</b> and located in states with stronger environmental protection programs than counties that rely on traditional techniques. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} problem in asthma {{appears to be}} immunological: young children {{in the early stages}} of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. Epidemiological findings give clues as to the pathogenesis: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much <b>more</b> common in <b>affluent</b> countries.|$|R
30|$|As expected, {{countries}} {{with higher levels}} of economic development (as quantified by average GDP per capita) repressed citizens less than those with lower levels of development ($ 21, 940 and $ 8875, respectively). This {{is not to say that}} violence did not occur in more developed countries, but rather that there was a general trend of less violent repression in <b>more</b> economically <b>affluent</b> geographical locations. Once again, this finding supports numerous studies that have demonstrated the connection between higher levels of GDP per capita and lower levels of governmental repression (Besley and Persson 2011; Weede 1987; Henderson 1991).|$|R
5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of {{the state board of education}} were named as defendants in the case.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mengele {{worked as}} a {{carpenter}} while residing in a boarding house in the suburb of Vicente López. After a few weeks {{he moved to the}} house of a Nazi sympathiser in the <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> neighborhood of Florida, Buenos Aires. He next {{worked as a}} salesman for his family's farm equipment company, and beginning in 1951 he made frequent trips to Paraguay as sales representative for that region. An apartment in the center of Buenos Aires became his residence in 1953, the same year he used family funds to buy a part interest in a carpentry concern. In 1954 he rented a house in the suburb of Olivos. Files released by the Argentine government in 1992 indicate that Mengele may have practiced medicine without a license, including performing abortions, while living in Buenos Aires.|$|E
50|$|From the 2000 Census to the 2010 Census, the Dayton {{region has}} seen a shift in {{population}} from its urban core to <b>more</b> out-lying <b>affluent</b> suburbs. This is evidenced by a 10% growth in population in Englewood, a 19% population growth in Beavercreek, and a 40% population growth in Springboro. Smaller growths in the 2010 census in the Dayton area included Miamisburg, Centerville, Vandalia, and Fairborn.Many of Dayton's suburbs that saw declines in populations fared well from 2000 to 2010. Dayton's largest suburb, Kettering for example, only saw a 2.3% decline during the ten-year period and Huber Heights, Dayton's third largest suburb, saw a 0.3% decline in population.|$|R
5000|$|Breastfeeding in the Western world {{declined}} significantily {{from the}} late 1800s to the 1960s. [...] By the 1950s, the predominant attitude to breastfeeding {{was that it was}} something practiced by the uneducated and those of lower classes. The practice was considered old-fashioned and [...] "a little disgusting" [...] for those who could not afford infant formula and discouraged by medical practitioners and media of the time. Letters and editorials to Chatelaine from 1945 to as late as 1995 regarding breastfeeding were predominantly negative. However, since the middle 1960s there has been a steady resurgence in the practice of breastfeeding in Canada and the US, especially among <b>more</b> educated, <b>affluent</b> women.|$|R
50|$|The {{compensation}} {{bears no}} relation to the means of the Defendant.

5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe {{showed the}} first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The negative consequences of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation of the currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, a {{neighborhood}} of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide {{between rich and poor}} in the city of Chula Vista; those on {{the eastern side of the}} freeway have been <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E

50|$|Given that {{different}} groups in society have different beliefs, priorities, and interests, to which group would the media tailor its bias? David Stromberg constructs a demand-driven model where media bias arises because different audiences have different effects on media profits. Advertisers pay <b>more</b> for <b>affluent</b> audiences and media may tailor content to attract this audience, perhaps producing a right-wing bias. On the other hand, urban audiences are more profitable to newspapers because of lower delivery costs. Newspapers may {{for this reason}} tailor their content to attract the profitable predominantly liberal urban audiences. Finally, because of the increasing returns to scale in news production, small groups such as minorities are less profitable. This biases media content against the interest of minorities.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of the 1996 Tax Reform Act on the labor supply of {{affluent}} men. The Act reduced marginal tax rates for the <b>affluent</b> <b>more</b> than for other taxpayers. Using instrumental-variables methods with a variety of identifying variables, we find essentially no responsiveness of the hours of work of high-income men to the tax reduction. However, we do find hourly wage rates of such men to have increased over the period. ...|$|R
5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E
5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the <b>more</b> <b>affluent</b> members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the <b>more</b> <b>affluent,</b> there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E

40|$|Extract] It {{is clear}} to me that neither bribery nor brute force will end {{terrorism}} in the Philippines, a fact that the government of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is just coming to grips with. Though her Government, with the assistance of American military advisors and personnel, appears to have had some successes against the Abu Sayyaf, this group is far from destroyed. [...] . Unless President Arroyo, or her successor, begins to deal with the causes of terrorism, rather than just with its symptoms, we can expect to see even more guerrilla violence and the tentacles of terrorism spreading throughout this complex and highly volatile country.

40|$|A {{more careful}} {{consideration}} of food waste {{is needed for}} planning the urban environment. The research signals links between the organization of individuals, the built environment and food waste management through a study conducted in Mexico. It recognizes the different scales within which solid waste management operates, explores food waste production at household levels, and investigates the urban circumstances that influence its management. This {{is based on the}} idea that sustainable food waste management in cities requires a constellation of processes through which a ‘people centered’ approach offers added value to technical and biological facts. This distinction addresses how urban systems react to waste and what behavioral and structural factors affect current sanitary practices in Mexico. Food waste is a resource-demanding item, which makes for a considerable amount of refuse being disposed of in landfills in developing cities. The existing data shortage on waste generation at household levels debilitates implementation strategies and there is a need for more contextual knowledge associated with waste. The evidence-based study includes an explorative phase on the culture of waste management and a more in-depth examination of domestic waste composition. Mixed data collection tools including a household based survey, a food waste diary and weighing recording system were developed to enquire into the daily practices of waste disposal in households. The contrasting urban environment of Mexico City Metropolitan Area holds indistinctive boundaries between the core and the periphery, which hinder the implementation of integrated environmental plans. External determinants are different modes of urban transformation and internal determinants are building features and their consolidation processes. At the household level, less and <b>more</b> <b>affluents</b> groups responded differently to external environmental stressors. A targeted planning proposition is required for each group. Local alternative waste management is more likely to be implement in less <b>affluent</b> contexts. Further, <b>more</b> effective demand-driven service delivery implies better integration between the formal and informal sectors. The results show that efforts toward securing long-term changes in Mexico and other cities with similar circumstances require creating synergy between education, building consolidation, local infrastructure and social engagement...|$|R
50|$|While the {{sanctuary}} of the Bond Street Synagogue was indeed beautiful, space for the growing religious school and social programs was severely lacking. By the 1930s, the congregation recognized that {{the time had come}} to move again. At the height of the depression, with a membership of just over 250 families, enough money was raised to buy the land and to build a sanctuary at a location on the then outer edge of the city. While most of Toronto's Jewish population, immigrant, mostly eastern European, poor and working class, were still located south of Bloor Street, particularly in the area between Yonge Street and Ossington Avenue (in particular The Ward, Kensington Market, Spadina Avenue and Bathurst Street), almost two-thirds of Holy Blossom's <b>more</b> established, <b>affluent</b> congregants, many of whom were second or third generation immigrants and hailing from western Europe, lived north of St. Clair Avenue.|$|R
