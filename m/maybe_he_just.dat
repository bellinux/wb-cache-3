2500|$|Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman– Walter's cooking {{partner and}} former student. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. [...] "He's just this lost soul– I don't think he's a bad kid, {{he just got}} mixed in the wrong crowd." [...] Paul {{elaborated}} on the character's background, saying, [...] "He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> didn't relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse." [...] Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to The Odd Couple.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman in Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a [...] "C" [...] rating and criticized it for feeling [...] "cramped and underimagined". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Rick Groen wrote, [...] "Perhaps his TV {{background}} makes him unaccustomed {{to the demands}} of a feature-length script (the ending seems almost panicky in its abruptness), or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> succumbs to the lure of the easy yuk...what began as discomfiting satire soon devolves into silly farce." [...] In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote, [...] "It has the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn't gather much momentum." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit I was talking about him, but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, saying that [...] "The How Country Feels album was a commercial comeback album for Houser, but this song feels more personal. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>just</b> more confident after several No. 1 hits. “We Went” {{is not a}} true vocal showcase a la “Like a Cowboy,” but there’s enough power between his voice and this arrangement to remind fans he’s not resting on a good year or two." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{comparison}} to Keef's mixtape, Back From the Dead 2, Meaghan Garvey of Pitchfork Media, stated that Nobody was, [...] "sharper, clearer, and more purposeful." [...] Garvey adds her {{opinions on the}} tracks, commenting, [...] "a handful feel more like sketches than completed works. But its high points have a clarity unmatched within Keef’s {{last two years of}} work; at times, he’s straight up vulnerable. He may not be coming back to earth any time soon, but he’s looking his audience in the eyes." [...] Garvey gave the album an overall score of 7 out of 10, stating, [...] "Nobody is, at its best, strikingly lucid. Maybe his recent passion for visual art has rekindled an interest in direct expression. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>just</b> growing up." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 22, 1991, Capt. Manuel Rivera {{died while}} {{conducting}} a training mission over the Persian Gulf when his AV-8B Harrier {{smashed into the}} Omani coastline while approaching {{the deck of the}} amphibious assault ship USS Nassau (LHA-4) for a landing. The real cause of the crash was not settled. Investigators believed condensation on the AV-8B's canopy could have interfered with the pilot's vision, or <b>maybe</b> that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> became disorientated by the horizon ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we got there, and I breezed up to {{the desk}} and said to the clerk, 'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?' Saaaay! You'd 'a' thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! He hands me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and he ducks behind the rigamajig they {{keep track of the}} rooms on. Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was all right--he {{certainly}} took long enough--or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> went to sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him, and croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.' 'Well, that's awful nice of you--sorry to trouble you--how much 'll it set me back?' I says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,' he says.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] the {{stranger}} assented. [...] "Then I didn't {{know what to}} do, for a minute. The porter was a pretty thick-headed darky, but he was lion-hearted; and his idea was to lay hold of a burglar wherever he could find him. There were plenty of burglars in the aisle there, or people that were afraid of burglars, {{and they seemed to}} think the porter had a good idea. They had hold of one another already, and now began to pull {{up and down the aisles}} in a way that reminded me of the old-fashioned mesmeric lecturers, when they told their subjects that they were this or that, and set them to acting the part. I remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were at a horse--race, and his subjects all got astride of their chairs, and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths. I thought of that now, and although it was rather a serious business, for I didn't know what minute they would come to blows, I couldn't help laughing. The sight was weird enough. Every one looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled. The young lady in the stateroom was doing her full share. She was screaming, 'Won't somebody let me out?' and hammering on the door. I guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the conductor at last, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> came round in the course of nature to take up the tickets. It was before the time when they took the tickets at the gate, and you used to stick them into a little slot at the side of your berth, and the conductor came along and took them in the night, somewhere between Worcester and Springfield, I should say." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (The Boy and the Bridge, 1959 (d: Kevin McClory) SG {{worked on}} this but is not {{credited}} as AD, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> did sketches? Locs: Tower Bridge, Bermondsey) ...|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{back in the}} apartment, Ted laments his situation, and Lily {{tells him}} to stop chasing {{something}} that is not working, and let the universe take over for a bit. When Lily tells him that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should <b>just</b> take 'the leap' and do what the world seems to want him to do, Ted accepts the professor job at the University. Marshall takes the advice literally, and leaps from the roof to the other building, followed {{by the rest of the}} gang.|$|R
5000|$|Walker {{stated that}} Fall {{was one of}} his {{favorite}} songs on his album. He also said after recording the track that “Keith stood up and high-fived the engineer when we got done with the vocal and I thought, that’s the first that I’ve ever seen that, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> glad that I got all the lyrics right, it was refreshing to know there wasn’t a lot of wasted time in the studio with Keith. He knows what he wants and he communicates that with the musicians really well." ...|$|R
50|$|Some sceptical {{scientists}} {{add this}} legend would definitely distinguish Déodat as a holy itinerant {{who was not}} a benedictin monk : he comes from nowhere. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> a Christian chief. Only one fact is sure : Déodat is the founder and first patron of a Merovingian district with political and religious power, a ban decided by the king of Austrasia Childeric II. And, after his dead, he was considered and consacred by local populations as a holy man. As, for orthodoxic thinkers of these times, only monk could be perfect, Déodat was becoming gradually a monk.|$|R

5000|$|... "Some {{people at}} the {{networks}} felt <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wasn't likable enough," [...] Miss Keating said, [...] "But I persisted. I felt I owed it to him to present his story the way he wrote it. The film is my valentine to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{reference}} to the season 3 finale, the series creator, Bruno Heller, has stated: [...] "What you get from that scene is what you should get. The viewer {{is supposed to be}} convinced. Patrick Jane is certain it's Red John... The thing is, Red John is a master of the mind game. If Red John wanted to die, maybe this is how he wanted to die. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wants Jane to think he's dead." ...|$|E
50|$|After a {{significant}} amount of exploring, he finds a single house that may hold the answers to his missing memory. How he could have missed it on first waking, is beyond him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> pointed in the wrong direction, and he started wandering off randomly, and forgot to turn around. Inside, he discovers what appears to be three suspended animation tanks, one of which is labeled REX, another REGINA - both with their tops off - and on looking inside, mysteriously vacant. The other tank is labeled VENUS and holds a woman who is the most breathtakingly beautiful thing he has ever seen.|$|R
5000|$|Now that Archie is dating Hilda, Hilda is {{starting}} to have issues about this romance because that she's not quite feeling it for him or <b>maybe</b> because <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> so nice to her. During a date at a diner and just as she's about to break up with him, a woman named Felissa shows up, fawning all over him and with good reason: she used to date Archie. That incident doesn't detour Hilda by inviting Archie back to the house, but when he suspects that she was only turned on when it seemed like another woman wanted him, he leaves immediately, {{even though she was}} just kidding.|$|R
5000|$|Other early {{influences}} were Hendrix, Deep Purple and Zeppelin. [...] "I still can't believe where Hendrix came from. OK Seattle <b>maybe</b> but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> suddenly appeared, {{as if from}} nowhere, {{this black}} guy playing guitar in a way no one had imagined it could be played. He {{was more than a}} genius in my eyes, someone very, very special. I loved early Purple and the combined sound of Organ and guitar gave them a very powerful sound, again unique at the time. As for Zeppelin, what can you say, 'Whole lotta Love', 'Communication Breakdown', 'Black Dog', and the epic 'Kashmir' again a unique band with great songs. All these bands formed an impression on me going back to those early days.|$|R

5000|$|One {{songwriter}} who {{was reached}} for a collaboration was XTCs Andy Partridge who explains: [...] "I rang {{up a lot of}} people ... and heard quite a few stories that would put off any sane person from getting involved in the Brian Wilson camp ... They said he would call me ... either he changed his mind, or the management changed his mind, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> forgot, because Ive heard stories of people whove gone over to work with him, and hes not acknowledged them being in the room for days. ... hes definitely in the Wilsonverse, I dont think hes in the known universe. ... {{one of the few people}} you can actually call genius, I think, so hey, he can be as nutty as he wants." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were six}} in the brood. Five were hardy little fellows that made the water boil behind them as they scurried across the lake. But the sixth was a weakling. He had been hurt, by a hawk perhaps, or a big trout, or a mink; or he had {{swallowed}} a bone; or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> a weak little fellow with no accounting for it. Whenever the brood were startled, he struggled bravely {{a little while to}} keep up; then he always fell behind. The mother would come back, and urge, and help him; but it was of little use. He was not strong enough; and the last glimpse I always had of them was a foamy wake disappearing round a distant point, while far in the rear was a ripple where the little fellow still paddled away, doing his best pathetically.|$|R
40|$|As a textual {{critic who}} {{came of age in the}} 2 ̆ 790 s, it is {{difficult}} for me to talk about authorial intention. Indeed, most academics today tell their students to avoid declaring 2 ̆ 2 The message 2 ̆ 2 of a text, encouraging them instead to respect the multivalence of meaning, the slipperiness of poetic discourse, and the freedom of the author to engage discursive play without being pinned down by an absolute interpretation. But I confess that, despite my training, after having watched The Hangover and read all over the Internet about it, I can 2 ̆ 7 t help but wonder if director Todd Phillips is a misogynistic asshole. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> is <b>just</b> a film director trying to make money by selling a film that denigrates women and celebrates a retrograde version of masculinity. When you live in a culture of rape, either way, it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t really matter...|$|R

5000|$|We've known Wanga {{since he}} was a street kid. He lives in this house in Cape Town and squats on a farm. This year, Wanga was {{supposed}} to go to one of these rituals because he wasn't circumcised. We thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> shouldn't go because 60 kids fucking died this year because their penises didn't work properly afterward and shit. So I asked him what would happen if he didn't go to the bush, {{and he said that he}} wouldn't be a man and he wouldn't be able to speak to the other men.

5000|$|Since {{the finale}} aired, fans and {{television}} critics alike have speculated {{as to whether}} or not Timothy Carter really was Red John. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, creator Bruno Heller further added to the speculation by saying, [...] "Jane wanted to know if this was Red John or not. And the guy gave him proof that he was. The question remains: Was that Red John? The larger question is: How does Jane get away with murder?" [...] Heller went on to say, [...] "What you get from that scene is what you should get. The viewer is supposed to be convinced. Patrick Jane is certain it's Red John... Thing is, Red John is a master of the mind game. If Red John wanted to die, maybe this is how he wanted to die. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wants Jane to think he's dead." [...] When asked whether or not this meant the end of the Red John storyline, Heller simply said, [...] "Well, look at it this way. If you... killed your worst enemy, would that be the end of the story? No. It would be the beginning of a whole different story." ...|$|E
50|$|He's a human being; {{we should}} treat {{him the same}} as we treat any other G.I. In my opinion, I think the boy deserves it; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> got {{off on the wrong}} track. And I know for a fact when he went to Korea, he didn't know whether he was going to come back or he was going to stay there. So, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> got a little scared when <b>he</b> was captured. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was pressured, tortured. I don't think it's the boy's own fault. No doubt at the time—I never seen him or never met him—no doubt he was young and he wasn't trained properly.|$|R
5000|$|... “He’s really good,” Wright told Parrish. “Maybe I haven’t {{followed}} {{him as well}} because he’s from the Midwest, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> wouldn’t surprise anybody else.

5000|$|... "I {{was hoping}} {{that it would be}} like <b>he</b> <b>just</b> disappeared. It would be better for his mother and father. They knew he was a crazy kid. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> had met somebody, some group of people, and run off. The bottom line is that I let it happen. That makes me just as guilty.

5000|$|In 2002 Anne and Victor Kahu {{embarked}} on a relationship. There was huge contrast between the middle aged head of hospital and the young nurse, but Tuteao praised the relationship saying; [...] "Love knows no age, no colour ... She sort of makes him {{want to be a}} better man. Or try to be." [...] The two got engaged despite Anne developing feelings for Victor's son Nelson, who was the same age. Despite not acting on her feelings, Anne continued to grow attracted to Nelson as the wedding drew closer. The filming of the wedding meant three days of filming in cold conditions whilst onscreen {{it was to be a}} picturesque ceremony that was to be the soap's biggest wedding since Gina and Leonard's in 1993. Victor's actor - Calvin Tuteao enjoyed the experience saying; [...] "Had loads of extras, making heaps of noise out here — the place was rocking." [...] The two married but after the vowels Victor was arrested for murder after being framed by nemesis Kurt. However Anne did end up having an affair with Nelson and when Victor found out, he was infuriated and ended the relationship. When Anne was crushed by a collapsing building in the 2003 cliffhanger, Tuteao agreed that the two were too different, stating; [...] "They're not really compatible, I suppose. They're totally different. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wanted a younger woman, a trophy wife. But I think Victor would miss her, too, if she dies." [...] When Anne died, despite having moved on to Donna, Victor was devastated and was forced to reevaluate his life.|$|E
40|$|Jimmy Finger {{lived in}} the {{apartment}} directly above. It was 1973, and I was seven. Jimmy was two years older and attended what his mother called the “special school,” suggesting that Jimmy went there {{because he was a}} genius. And he looked like a genius to me: plastic-framed glasses, uncombed hair, filthy clothes. In the only photo that I have of him, he looks like he’s trapped inside of an invisible jail cell. He’s screaming, his arms are raised over his head as though he’s pounding at bars no one can see, and his glasses are crooked. He looks like an insane genius. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> looks insane...|$|E
