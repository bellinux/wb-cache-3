I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E

Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact that some things are just hard to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E

[...] Jackson tried {{to run out of}} the chapel three times but bodyguard Antonio Rossi grabbed her saying, [...] "There's some things you have to do. Even if you don't want to." [...] Jackson told Ebony magazine the marriage was [...] "strictly in name only. It has never been consummated." [...] Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed her head against the corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go.
