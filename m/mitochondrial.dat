5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. <b>Mitochondrial</b> genes are transcribed as multigenic transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs. Not all proteins necessary for <b>mitochondrial</b> function are encoded by the <b>mitochondrial</b> genome; most are coded by genes in the cell nucleus and the corresponding proteins are imported into the mitochondrion. The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the <b>mitochondrial</b> genome differs between species. Most <b>mitochondrial</b> genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human <b>mitochondrial</b> genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA, such as that of yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. <b>Mitochondrial</b> tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of <b>mitochondrial</b> tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, it was {{discovered}} that mitochondria contained ribosomes. In 1968, methods were developed for mapping the <b>mitochondrial</b> genes, with the genetic and physical map of yeast <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA being completed in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria {{have their}} own genetic material, and the {{machinery}} to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins (see: protein biosynthesis). A published human <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA sequence revealed 16,569base pairs encoding 37 genes: 22tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13peptide genes. The 13 <b>mitochondrial</b> peptides in humans are integrated into the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> membrane, along with proteins encoded by genes that reside in the host cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases of}} <b>mitochondrial</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of <b>mitochondrial</b> binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double <b>mitochondrial</b> membrane in <b>mitochondrial</b> division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying <b>mitochondrial</b> division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize <b>mitochondrial</b> division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for <b>mitochondrial</b> Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E
5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium. He tried to extract a <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA sequence from a preserved hair from Edward IV held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (n√©e Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA was tested and found to belong to <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the <b>mitochondrial</b> free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of <b>mitochondrial</b> proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause <b>mitochondrial</b> disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving <b>mitochondrial</b> dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Joy Ibsen, {{a retired}} journalist, died in 2008, leaving three children: Michael, Jeff and Leslie. On 24 August 2012, her son Michael (born in Canada in 1957, a cabinet maker based in London) gave a mouth-swab sample to the {{research}} team to compare with samples from the human remains found at the excavation. Analysts found a <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and an unnamed second direct maternal line descendant, who shares a relatively rare <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA sequence, <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA haplogroup J1c2c.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>mitochondrial</b> {{functions}} are performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A mutation in the genes regulating any of these functions can result in <b>mitochondrial</b> diseases.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>mitochondrial</b> genome is a {{circular}} DNA molecule of about 16 kilobases. It encodes 37 genes: 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V, 22 for <b>mitochondrial</b> tRNA (for the 20 standard amino acids, plus an extra gene for leucine and serine), and 2 for rRNA. One mitochondrion can contain two to ten copies of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Types B and C live {{close to}} the ice pack, and diatoms in these waters may be {{responsible}} for the yellowish coloring of both types. <b>Mitochondrial</b> DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete <b>mitochondrial</b> sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire <b>mitochondrial</b> genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E
5|$|While slight {{variations}} on the standard genetic code had been predicted earlier, none was discovered until 1979, when researchers studying human <b>mitochondrial</b> genes determined that they used an alternative code. However, the mitochondria of many other eukaryotes, including most plants, use the standard code. Many slight variants have been discovered since, including various alternative <b>mitochondrial</b> codes. Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E
25|$|The inner <b>mitochondrial</b> {{membrane}} (IMM) is the <b>mitochondrial</b> membrane which {{separates the}} <b>mitochondrial</b> matrix from the intermembrane space.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> {{disorders}} may {{be caused}} by mutations (acquired or inherited), in <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA (mtDNA), or in nuclear genes that code for <b>mitochondrial</b> components. They may also be the result of acquired <b>mitochondrial</b> dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs, infections, or other environmental causes (see MeSH).|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA codes for <b>mitochondrial</b> RNA, and {{therefore}} most <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA mutations lead to functional problems, {{which may be}} manifested as muscle disorders (myopathies).|$|E
25|$|About 1 in 4,000 {{children}} in the United States will develop <b>mitochondrial</b> disease {{by the age of}} 10 years. Up to 4,000 children per year in the US are born with a type of <b>mitochondrial</b> disease. Because <b>mitochondrial</b> disorders contain many variations and subsets, some particular <b>mitochondrial</b> disorders are very rare.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic <b>mitochondrial</b> {{transplant}} and protofection {{have been}} proposed as a possible treatment for inherited <b>mitochondrial</b> disease, and allotopic expression of <b>mitochondrial</b> proteins as a radical treatment for mtDNA mutation load.|$|E
25|$|The human <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA is of {{tremendous}} interest to geneticists, since it undoubtedly {{plays a role}} in <b>mitochondrial</b> disease. It also sheds light on human evolution; for example, analysis of variation in the human <b>mitochondrial</b> genome has led to the postulation of a recent common ancestor for all humans on the maternal line of descent (see <b>Mitochondrial</b> Eve).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> DNA (mtDNA) {{is nearly}} immune to sexual mixing, unlike the nuclear DNA whose {{chromosomes}} are shuffled and recombined in Mendelian inheritance. <b>Mitochondrial</b> DNA, therefore, {{can be used}} to trace matrilineal inheritance and to find the <b>Mitochondrial</b> Eve (also known as the African Eve), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> DNA {{mutations}} occur frequently, due to {{the lack}} of the error checking capability that nuclear DNA has (see Mutation rate). This means that <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often. Defects in enzymes that control <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA replication (all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear DNA) may also cause <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA mutations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> genome {{mutations}} {{are passed}} on 100% {{of the time}} from mother to all her offspring. So, if a female has a <b>mitochondrial</b> trait, all offspring inherit it. However, if a male has a <b>mitochondrial</b> trait, no offspring inherit it.|$|E
25|$|For <b>mitochondrial</b> {{mutations}} {{the plan}} is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the <b>mitochondrial</b> genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy. The <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA experiences {{a high degree of}} mutagenic damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria. A copy of the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals, and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs. All <b>mitochondrial</b> proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{transcription}} initiation in mitochondria involves {{three types of}} proteins: the <b>mitochondrial</b> RNA polymerase (POLRMT), <b>mitochondrial</b> transcription factor A (TFAM), and <b>mitochondrial</b> transcription factors B1 and B2 (TFB1M, TFB2M). POLRMT, TFAM, and TFB1M or TFB2M assemble at the <b>mitochondrial</b> promoters and begin transcription. The actual molecular events {{that are involved in}} initiation are unknown, but these factors make up the basal transcription machinery and have been shown to function in vitro.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> Eve {{is defined}} as the woman who was the matrilineal most recent common {{ancestor}} for all living humans. <b>Mitochondrial</b> Eve is estimated to have lived between 140,000 and 200,000 years ago, <b>Mitochondrial</b> Eve is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor, not the most recent common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|Unlike whole-animal {{respirometry}}, <b>mitochondrial</b> respirometry {{takes place}} in solution, i.e. the sample is suspended in a medium. Today <b>mitochondrial</b> respirometry is mainly performed with a closed-chamber approach.|$|E
25|$|A {{human cell}} has genetic {{material}} {{contained in the}} cell nucleus (the nuclear genome) and in the mitochondria (the <b>mitochondrial</b> genome). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes, including 22 homologous chromosome pairs {{and a pair of}} sex chromosomes. The <b>mitochondrial</b> genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in <b>mitochondrial</b> energy production and specific tRNAs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mitochondrial</b> ribosomes of {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{are produced}} from <b>mitochondrial</b> genes, and functionally resemble many features {{of those in}} bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> {{genetics}} {{concerns the}} diagnosis and management of <b>mitochondrial</b> disorders, which have a molecular basis but often result in biochemical abnormalities due to deficient energy production.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>mitochondrial</b> {{function}} and biogenesis {{is controlled by}} nuclear DNA. Human <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain, {{while most of the}} estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded. Defects in nuclear-encoded <b>mitochondrial</b> genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia, dementia, hypertension, lymphoma, retinopathy, seizures, and neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{in nuclear}} genes that encode {{proteins}} that mitochondria use can {{also contribute to}} <b>mitochondrial</b> diseases. These diseases do not follow <b>mitochondrial</b> inheritance patterns, but instead follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.|$|E
25|$|Cells can undergo necroptosis in {{response}} to perturbed homeostasis in specific circumstances. In response to DNA damage, the RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated and lead to deterioration of the cell {{in the absence of}} caspase activation. The necrosome inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria to decrease cellular ATP levels. Uncoupling of the <b>mitochondrial</b> electron transport chain leads to additional <b>mitochondrial</b> damage and opening of the <b>mitochondrial</b> permeability transition pore, which releases <b>mitochondrial</b> proteins into the cytosol. The necrosome also causes leakage of lysosomal digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm by induction of reactive oxygen species by JNK, sphingosine production, and calpain activation by calcium release.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a series of}} papers {{have shown that the}} <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA (mtDNA) base {{composition}} correlates with animal species maximum life span. The <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA base composition is though to reflect its nucleotide-specific (guanine, cytosine, thymidine and adenine) different mutation rates (i.e., accumulation of guanine in the <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA of an animal species is due to low guanine mutation rate in the mitochondria of that species).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitochondrial</b> DNA mtDNA {{represents}} the female lineage. The Iranian <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA shows more Western Eurasian lineages than the Y-DNA lineages. Nonetheless, a West Eurasian MtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).|$|E
25|$|In humans, the 16,569 base {{pairs of}} <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA encode for only 37 genes. Human <b>mitochondrial</b> DNA {{was the first}} {{significant}} part of the human genome to be sequenced. In most species, including humans, mtDNA is inherited solely from the mother.|$|E
