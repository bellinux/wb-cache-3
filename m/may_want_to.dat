Also, the patient may want an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in hypochondria or with cosmetic surgery; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the doctor-patient relationship.|$|E
