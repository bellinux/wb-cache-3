At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and production equipment, as well as a huge variety of spare parts.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing precision <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and paper. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of waterpower and later the steam engine to power factories, and canals and later railroads for transporting goods and materials. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Canada.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> {{for the use}} of extracting for western lowland gorillas, gorillas are able to adapt tools to a {{particular}} use by selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark and adapting their length to the depth of the holes. It appears that they also anticipate the use of the tool since they begin with biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level sensorimotor intelligence similar to that of young human children.|$|E

The most important remaining settlement of this period is that at Star Carr, where archaeologists have found evidence of a permanent house 10,500 years ago on the shore of what was then a shallow lake, as well as [...] "a wooden platform extending 18-20 feet over the surface of the lake itself near Scarborough, where, due to waterlogged conditions, a considerable quantity of organic remains as well as flint tools, have survived. This is Britain’s best-known Mesolithic site. The site, on the eastern shores of glacial Lake Pickering, was surrounded by birch trees, some of which had been cleared and used to construct a rough platform of [...] branches and brushwood. [...] Lumps of turf and stones had been thrown on top of this construction to make a village site.

50|$|In 2002 Palisades Toys {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} manufacture {{a new line of}} Micronauts toys from Abrams Gentile Entertainment, LLC; the company which was formed in the aftermath of Mego’s collapse to retain and manage Mego’s licensing contracts, rights and deals. This licensing agreement was done by Palisades under the assumption that the original <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tooling</b> and molds from the 1970s Mego toy line were still available. When Palisades discovered the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tooling</b> and molds were not available—presumably lost or destroyed over the years—it turned to the Micronaut/Microman collector’s community to donate vintage toys so Palisades could create new molds to replicate the figures. Most of the Palisades reissues were Mego Micronaut figures based on Takara designs, but several original alien designs from the original Mego toy line—such as Repto, Membros and Centaurus—were included the line as well.|$|R
