40|$|CONTEXT: Patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> {{and neck}} {{neoplasia}} may present simultaneous involvement of large vessels {{due to the}} growth of the tumoral mass. The therapeutic options are chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or combined treatments. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the result of surgical treatment with carotid reconstruction in patients with advanced <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck neoplasia. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Hospital do Câncer A. C. Camargo, São Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven patients operated because of advanced <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck neoplasia that was involving the internal and/or common carotid artery. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: By means of clinical examination, outpatient follow-up and duplex scanning, we analyzed the patency of the carotid grafts, vascular and non-vascular complications, disease recurrence and survival of the patients. RESULTS: Six patients (54. 5 %) did not present any type of complication. There was one vascular complication represented by an occlusion of the carotid graft with a cerebrovascular stroke in one hemisphere. Non-vascular complications occurred in five patients (45. 5 %). During the follow-up, eight patients died (72. 7 %), of whom seven had loco-regional tumor recurrence and one had pulmonary and hepatic metastases (at an average of 9 months after the operation). Seven of these patients presented functioning grafts. The three patients still alive have no tumor recurrence and their grafts are functioning (an average of 9 months has passed since the operation). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck neoplasia involving the carotid artery that are treated surgically present a prognosis with reservations. When the internal and/or common carotid artery is resected en-bloc with the tumor, arterial reconstruction must be performed. The long saphenous vein is a suitable vascular substitute...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To prospectively analyse the clinical, {{biochemical}} and radiological {{characteristics of}} the mass lesions arising in a background of chronic calcific pancreatitis (CCP). METHODS: Eighty three patients, who presented with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and a mass lesion in the head of pancreas between February 2005 and December 2011, {{were included in the}} study. Patients who were identified to have malignancy underwent Whipple&#x 2019;s procedure and patients whose investigations were suggestive of a benign lesion underwent Frey&#x 2019;s procedure. Student t-test was used to compare the mean values of imaging findings [common bile duct (CBD), main pancreatic duct (MPD) size] and laboratory data [Serum bilirubin, carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9) ] between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis was done to calculate the cutoff valves of serum bilirubin, CA 19 - 9, MPD and CBD size. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive valve (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using these cut off points. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: The study included 56 men (67. 5 %) and 27 women (32. 5 %). Sixty (72. 3 %) patients had tropical calcific pancreatitis and 23 (27. 7 %) had alcohol related CCP. Histologically, it was confirmed that 55 (66. 3 %) of the 83 patients had an inflammatory head mass and 28 (33. 7 %) had a <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> mass. The mean age of individuals with benign inflammatory mass and those with malignant mass was 38. 4 years and 45 years respectively. Significant clinical features that predicted a <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> mass in CP were presence of a head mass in CCP of tropics, old age, jaundice, sudden worsening abdominal pain, gastric outlet obstruction and significant weight loss (P &#x 2264; 0. 05).

40|$|The {{rationale}} behind studying biological markers of tumour response to radiation therapy in {{head and neck}} cancers {{is to increase the}} individualisation of radiation therapy. This should ultimately lead to improvements in local control and survival and reduced morbidity. An evaluation was made of the theoretical and practical value of using low-dose rate irradiation to increase the resolution of clonogenic assays for radiosensitivity testing. In tumour cell lines low-dose rate irradiation improved discrimination between tumour radioresponsiveness groups. However, low-dose rate irradiation of primary human tumours followed by soft-agar clonogenic assay was impractical because it reduced the success rate for obtaining radiosensitivity data. One hundred and forty specimens of <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumours of different histology types were assessed for ability to grow in vitro (colony forming efficiency, CFE) and inherent tumour radiosensitivity (surviving fraction at 2 Gy, SF 2) using a clonogenic soft-agar assay. The success rate for growing colonies was 74 % (104 / 140) with a median CFE = 0. 031 %. SF 2 was obtained for 88 / 140 patients (63 %) with a median SF 2 = 0. 43. A comparison was made of SF 2 values for different primary human tumour types. This showed that head and neck- (p = 0. 03), cervix- (p = 0. 02) and colorectal carcinomas (p = 0. 003) were significantly more radioresistant than lymphomas. The relationships between proliferation, TP 53 and SF 2 were evaluated. No correlations were seen between SF 2 and any of the parameters analysed. The study demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining parallel measurements of different biological markers in a large number of patients with head and neck cancers. A study was made of SF 2 in relation to the immunohistochemical expression levels of the individual components (Ku (p 70 /p 80) and DNA-PKcs) of the DNA double strand break repair enzyme, DNA-PK. No significant relationship was found between SF 2 and the expression levels of Ku (p 70 /p 80) or DNA-PKcs for patients with head and neck cancers. Finally, the relationship between SF 2 and treatment outcome was prospectively studied in 84 patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers.

40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) is {{a unique}} <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer with clinical, demographic, and geographic features distinct from other head and neck epithelial malignancies. Non-keratinizing, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated WHO types 2 and 3 {{is the most common}} subtypes of NPC. NPC is also characterized by its relatively high sensitivity to radiation, so that in the last decades radiotherapy (RT) has been the cornerstone of treatment. However, in the majority of cases NPC is discovered at locally advanced stage. The results are disappointing when RT alone is offered. The 5 -year survival rates have been reported to be about 34 - 52 %. The poor prognosis for advanced NPC led to increasing interests in exploring the use of chemotherapy (CT). NPC has been considered to be not only radiosensitive but also chemo-sensitive and has shown high response rate to various chemotherapeutic agents. Certainly, the treatment strategies for NPC will continue to change and evolve as a better understanding is gained of the molecular and immune mechanisms that drive this disease.

40|$|Background: Current {{staging systems}} have limited ability to adjust optimal therapy in {{advanced}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to delineate {{the correlation between}} tumor volume, treatment outcome and chemotherapy cycles in advanced NPC. Methods: A retrospective review of 110 patients with stage III-IV NPC was performed. All patients were treated first with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, then concurrent chemoradiation, and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy as being the definitive therapy. Gross tumor volume of primary tumor plus retropharyngeal nodes (GTVprn) was calculated to be an index of treatment outcome. Results: GTVprn had {{a close relationship with}} survival and recurrence in advanced NPC. Large GTVprn (≧ 13 ml) was associated with a significantly poorer local control, lower distant metastasis-free rate, and poorer survival. In patients with GTVprn ≧ 13 ml, overall survival was better after ≧ 4 cycles of chemotherapy than after less than 4 cycles.

40|$|Carcinomas of {{the head}} and neck {{typically}} exhibit complex chromosome aberrations but the underlying mutational mechanisms remain obscure. Evaluation of cell division dynamics in low-passage cell lines from three benign and five <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumours revealed a strong positive correlation between multipolarity of the mitotic spindle and the formation of bridges at anaphase in both benign and malignant tumours. Cells exhibiting a high rate of mitotic abnormalities also showed several chromosome termini lacking TTAGGG repeats and a high frequency of dicentric chromosomes. Multicolour karyotyping demonstrated a preferential involvement in structural rearrangements of chromosomes with deficient telomeres. The majority of malignant, mitotically unstable tumours expressed the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase. These data indicate that some of the genomic instability in head and neck tumours is initiated by telomere dysfunction, leading to the formation of dicentric chromosomes. These form chromosome bridges at mitosis that could prevent the normal anaphase-telophase transition. In turn, this may cause an accumulation of centrosomes and mitotic multipolarity. Telomerase expression does not confer total stability to the tumour genome but could be crucial for moderating the rate of chromosomal evolution...|$|R

Directly after routine PET/CT imaging with a whole-body system using the glucose derivative 2 -[(18) F]fluoro- 2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as a radiotracer additional measurements were performed with a prototype PET/MRI system for simultaneous PET and MR imaging. Physiological radiotracer uptake within regular anatomical structures as well as tumour uptake were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively (metabolic ratios) in relation to cerebellar uptake on the PET/MRI and PET/CT systems.

ADCs were determined on tumor-by-tumor (overall ADCs) and pixel-by-pixel (ADC mapping) bases by using 2 b-values (500 and 1000 s/mm 2). RESULTS: Lymphomas and oropharyngeal SCCs had unique histologic features in terms of keratiniza-tion, cell attenuation, stromal areas, and necrosis and had distinctive ADCs (0. 503 0. 099 103 mm 2 /s for lymphomas and 0. 842 0. 164 103 mm 2 /s for SCCs).

RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference (P. 004) between the mean ADC values (in 103 mm 2 /s) in the benign and malignant lesions (1. 505 0. 487; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 305 – 1. 706, and 1. 071 0. 293; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 864 – 1. 277, respectively). There were 2 malig-nant lesions with ADC values higher than 1. 3 103 mm 2 /s and 5 benign lesions with ADC values less than 1. 3 103 mm 2 /s. The lack of overlap of ADC values within 95 % confidence limits suggests tha...|$|R

FOG PET, which shows the proliferativeactivity of tumors, is consideredto be a usefulmethodfor managingtumors. J Nucl Med 1992; 33 : 325 - 329 ositron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F-fluoro deoxyglucose (FDG) {{has been used to}} diagnose various kinds of malignant tumors. Good correlation between glucose metabolism measured by PET using FDG (FDG PET) and grade of malignancy has been reported in brain, hepatic and musculoskeletal tumors (1 â€” 4). We compared pathological diagnosis, tumor size, 67 Ga scintigraphy, and clinical course in malignant lymphoma with FDG-PET. FDG-PET showed promise as a useful method for man aging tumor and predicting prognosis (5). FDG-PET seems useful in accessing the biological behavior of malig nant tumor. The relationship between glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET and pathological findings, includ ing proliferative activity, has not been studied closely. Minn et al. showed a clear correlation between the prolif erative activity estimated by DNA flow cytometry and the uptake of FDG in thirteen patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumors (6).

40|$|Summary Twenty {{patients}} with <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumours were imaged with 9 Tcm-labelled hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO), a radiopharmaceutical generally used for blood flow studies. Before radiotherapy (RT), 93 % of the tumours could be detected with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 45 % with planar imaging. Whole tumour-to-background "TcmHMPAO uptake ratios ranged from 3. 6 to 1. 0 (mean 1. 7 0. 6) in untreated tumours. There {{was a good}} correlation between tumour volume and uptake (r = 0. 69, P = 0. 002). Sixteen patients were reimaged during or shortly after radical RT. 9 TcmHMPAO uptake was significantly lower after treatment (mean uptake ratio 1. 2 ± 0. 3, P< 0. 001). However, RT associated changes in 9 TcmHMPAO uptake were {{in agreement with the}} clinical response in only 63 % of the studies. This study indicates that 9 TcmHMPAO SPECT imaging can be used for pretherapeutic localisation of head and neck tumours. Although most tumours show a decrease in uptake after irradiation the poor association with tumour regression does not allow for reliable assessment of treatment response. Since tumour blood flow may be a crucial determinant of the effect of chemo- and radiotherapy, there is a great need for rapid and, preferably, non-invasive methods to assess tumour perfusion. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides th...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Hemangiopericytoma is a {{relatively}} rare tumor, first described in 1942, with approximately 300 cases described in the literature to date. In most cases, it affects the trunk and lower extremities. The head and neck incidence is less than 20 %, mostly in adults. We describe a case of <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck hemangiopericytoma in a child. TYPE OF STUDY: Case report. CASE REPORT: A twelve-year-old male patient noted {{the presence of a}} firm painless right-side retroauricular lymph node of 1 cm in diameter, which at first remained unchanged for six months, but subsequently enlarged progressively. He denied having had previous trauma at that site. In November 2000, he presented nasal obstruction and voluminous epistaxis that required hospitalization and blood transfusion. During dental treatment one month later, a cranial x-ray revealed bone alterations. A subsequent computed tomography scan showed an extensive lesion of soft tissue density that had invaded the maxillary fossa, eroding the skull base and middle and nasal fossa. The child was then referred to our service, where biopsy was performed, giving a diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma. Shortly afterwards, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that this lesion had undergone significant growth, while maintaining the same invasion pattern. The patient was submitted to conservative surgery in April 2001, with only partial resection of the tumor because of its extent. Histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the presence of malignant hemangiopericytoma. Following the surgery, the patient presented fast regrowth of the lesion, with partial response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{habit of}} smoking and intake of {{alcoholic}} drinks {{can lead to}} the incidence of malignant tumors in several areas, including the head or neck. Phonoaudiology is an area of oncology that is always seeking to expand its applications in oncological head and neck cases, with intervention in pre- and post-operative periods and in different clinical fields. Aim: To evaluate and describe the impact of phonoaudiology preoperative guidance in patients, specifically smokers and alcohol drinkers, with head and neck cancer. Methods: Series Study. Interviews were conducted by telephone with 40 individuals diagnosed with <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumors. Questionnaires regarding the use of tobacco and alcohol were administered before and after the phonoaudiology preoperative guidance. Results: Among the 40 individuals who received phonoaudiology preoperative guidance, 26 were smokers before the orientation. Of these 26 individuals, 18 (69. 24 %) abandoned tobacco dependence, 4 (15. 38 %) did not quit smoking, and 4 (15. 38 %) quit smoking for a few months before resuming smoking after receiving phonoaudiology preoperative guidance. Regarding alcohol consumption, 31 individuals ingested alcohol before phonoaudiology preoperative guidance. Of these 31 individuals, 17 (54. 84 %) abandoned alcohol dependence, 8 (25. 81 %) did not abstain from alcohol consumption, and 6 (19. 35 %) resumed alcohol consumption after a period of abstinence after receiving phonoaudiology preoperative guidance. Conclusion: Phonoaudiology preoperative orientations are effective in the treatment of <b>head</b> and neck <b>malignant</b> tumors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Awareness of {{invasion}} of {{the walls of the}} carotid arteries by <b>malignant</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumors is of great clinical importance before surgery and can change patient management. This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of Computed Tomography (CT) in distinguishing carotid artery (CA) invasion by neck malignant tumors according different criteria. "nMaterials and Methods: CT with contrast was performed on 40 patients with malignant neck tumors before surgery. Abnormal CT findings were categorized into 6 types: I, tumor encasement equal or greater than 270 degrees; II, tumor encasement greater than 180 degrees; III, compression; IV, displacement; V, segmental deletion of fat planes between tumor and CA and VI, ill-defined CA wall;. The CT appearances of all tumors were prospectively compared with surgical and histopathological findings as gold standard. "nResults: Abnormal CT findings in our patients according to the different types were; I: 6 tumors; II: 17 tumors; III: 2 tumors; IV: 8 tumor; V: 33 tumors and VI: 7 tumors. Surgical findings recorded that tumors invaded the CA in 13 cases. The sensivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy (all with % 95 confidence interval) for the different types were analyzed and the results showed type I, V and VI were statistically significant. "nConclusion: CT is the most frequently used imaging modality in diagnosing the tumoral location and staging but it isn't a definite way in diagnosing CA involvement by malignant lesions. However, our study demonstrated that type (I), (V) and (VI) can be valuable in the determination. "nKeywords: Computed Tomography, Carotid Artery, Neck Malignant Tumor...|$|R
