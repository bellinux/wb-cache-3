5|$|Fairley's declining health {{prompted}} him to leave London and move to The Grove, Sonning, Berkshire, where he died on 19 April 1966, and {{was buried in the}} graveyard of St Andrew's Church, Sonning. He was survived by his wife and their two sons, who were both <b>medical</b> <b>doctors,</b> and also by the son of his first marriage, who had become an Australian Army officer. His son Gordon Hamilton-Fairley, a renowned oncologist, was killed by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb on 22 October 1975.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of <b>medical</b> <b>doctors,</b> who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|Manual was {{initially}} a three-year school with some general academic classes and {{an emphasis on}} mechanical and industrial training. Although graduates recall the school being viewed as blue-collar and academically inferior to Male High School in its early days, numerous early graduates {{went on to become}} <b>medical</b> <b>doctors,</b> and students published a literary magazine called The Crimson from 1899 to 1955. In order to accommodate newly added French and Latin classes, Manual was expanded to a four-year school in 1901. In 1911, Manual became the first school in Kentucky to serve lunches to students.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. <b>Medical</b> <b>doctors</b> sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and <b>medical</b> <b>doctors.</b> The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple <b>medical</b> <b>doctors,</b> scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5|$|There are {{hundreds}} of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 23,967 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700thousand patients per year and employ 5,205 <b>medical</b> <b>doctors,</b> including 3,929 specialists. There are 6,379 private practice offices, {{and a total of}} 41,271health workers in the country. There are 63 emergency medical service units, responding to more than a million calls. The principal cause of death in 2008 was cardiovascular disease at 43.5% for men and 57.2% for women, followed by tumours, at 29.4% for men and 21.4% for women. In 2009 only 13 Croatians had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 6 had died from the disease. In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27.4% of Croatians over age of 15 are smokers. According to 2003 WHO data, 22% of the Croatian adult population is obese.|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito {{to be able to}} fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two <b>medical</b> <b>doctors</b> were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E

Other significant causes of death are injuries, poisonings and other external causes (7.7% men/3.9% women), digestive system diseases (5.7% men/3.6% women), respiratory system diseases (5.1% men/3.5% women) and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (2.1% men/3.0% women). There is no other cause of disease affecting more than 3% of the population. In 2014 only 22 Croatians had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 4 had died from the disease. In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27.4% of Croatians over age of 15 were smokers. According to 2003 WHO data, 22% of the Croatian adult population is obese.|$|E
