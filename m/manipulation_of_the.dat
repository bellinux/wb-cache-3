5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting {{based on their}} own interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guest list.|$|E
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between {{elements of the}} environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E

5|$|Campaigns in From Dust are {{structured}} as {{a sequence of}} missions, whereby completing certain objectives expedites the tribe's progress and bestows additional powers, such as the capacity to jellify water. Tribal shamans alert the player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, physical <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to and manipulate further.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monsoon winds, soon {{resulting}} in trade crossing boundaries {{such as the}} Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E

5|$|On March 30, 1993, it was {{announced}} that Gil Stein, who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, had been inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall's board of directors and by telling them to change the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price affected the wider economy. Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E

5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality of the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E
5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} {{developed between}} the uprising's communist {{leadership and the}} nationalists participating. The nationalists recognised the uprising had been crushed and wanted to stop fighting, while the Partisans were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, the nationalists contacted the Italians and offered to help them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. The nationalists had closer ties with Serbia and possessed a frontier mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue the uprising by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue fighting the Italians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
5|$|During {{location}} scouting in December 2010, Nolan {{began searching}} for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan. According to the Romania Insider, Nolan {{was interested in}} Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine. The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, coming down to about $230 million after tax credits. Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated {{that he intended to}} focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes). Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX, but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX planned to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks. Nolan also bypassed the use of a digital intermediate for the film, resulting in less <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filmed image and higher film resolution.|$|E
