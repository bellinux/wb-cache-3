Darryl accepts {{them back and}} shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E
5|$|Simão de Andrade, {{brother to}} Fernão Pires, sailed from Malacca to China {{with a small}} crew on three junks in August 1519. Simão {{immediately}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> impression upon the Chinese when he built a fort {{at the center of}} Tuen Mun, an island designated for all foreigners to trade. Soon after, Simão ceremoniously executed a Portuguese and barred other foreigners (mostly Siamese and other South East Asians) from trading on the island, which drew even more attention to him. When a Chinese official visited the island and began reasserting Ming authority over it, Simão became aggressive and hit him, knocking the official's hat off.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934, Brimsek was invited to the Detroit Red Wings {{training}} camp for a shot at playing in the National Hockey League (NHL). Jack Adams, the Red Wings' coach and manager, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> impression on Brimsek. He felt that Adams {{had a habit of}} favoritism. This led him to try out for another professional team, the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). Unfortunately for Brimsek, the Orioles decided to cut him. Disappointed, Brimsek hitchhiked back to Eveleth. On his way back home, he had a chance meeting with the owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, John H. Harris. The Yellow Jackets were in need for a goaltender and Harris proceeded to sign Brimsek to the team. Brimsek started for the Yellow Jackets {{for the first time in}} 1934–35 by playing 16 games exhibition games. Out of those 16 games, he won 14 of them.|$|E

5|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Christian was {{defeated}} by Alberto Del Rio in a number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship after a distraction from Brodus Clay. After Edge's sudden retirement from wrestling on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Christian won a 20-man battle royal to determine who will face Del Rio for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules, where Christian defeated Del Rio to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Randy Orton. At the Over The Limit pay-per-view event, he failed to regain the championship from Orton. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown, Christian was the Special Referee for a World Heavyweight Championship defense by Orton against Sheamus. Orton went on to successfully defend the title. After the match, Christian hit Orton with the title belt, turning heel {{for the second time}} since 2005. At Capitol Punishment, Christian faced Orton for the World Heavyweight championship once again, however he failed to capture the title. At Money in the Bank, Christian won the World Heavyweight Championship, after Orton was disqualified for kicking him in the groin; the stipulation was if Orton was disqualified or the referee <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> call, he would lose the title. At SummerSlam, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Orton in a No Holds Barred match. On the August 26 episode of SmackDown, special guest General Manager Bret Hart announced that Christian would face Orton in a steel cage match on the August 30 episode of SmackDown for the championship, in which Christian went on to lose the encounter, thus ending the feud. Christian then began feuding with Sheamus, leading to a match between the two at the Hell in a Cell and Vengeance pay-per-views, both of which Christian lost.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless Romarate had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> judgment. On the {{one side}} the Spanish {{squadron}} under frigate captain José Primo de Rivera y Ortiz de Pinedo was negligent and had not positioned his fores in case he would be required as defensive reinforcements, be it {{in the case of}} defeat, as support or victory, and the measures to be taken after Romarate's order was known were so lax that Romarate never received reinforcements nor supplies.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} that Lee had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{strategic}} decision; he believed himself outnumbered (which he was; British commander Sir Henry Clinton had 10,000 troops to Lee's 5,440) and that a retreat was reasonable. But he disobeyed orders, and he publicly expressed disrespect to his commander in chief. Washington had wanted to test the abilities of Lee's troops, since they {{were among the first to}} be trained in European tactics by Baron von Steuben.|$|E
25|$|WG Grace had {{collected}} together {{a strong side}} to meet the West Indians in their first match. The tourists <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start when Aucher Warner lost the toss and WG and James Gilman added 135 for the first wicket.

25|$|Next morning, {{the last}} wicket pair added 25 more runs which were to prove vital, {{as well as}} {{reducing}} the time that Australia had at their disposal. They were set 233 to win in {{what turned out to}} be 69 eight ball overs. The required run rate was 42 per 100 balls, which should not have been unduly challenging. However Australia <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start, and when they were 92-6, Hall having taken four of the wickets, seemed doomed to defeat. However Davidson (80) and Benaud (52) then took the score to 226, with only seven more runs needed.|$|E
25|$|India <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start, {{falling to}} 3/73. The middle order scored fluently, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls, 7 fours) top scoring. Before Azharuddin was removed lbw by Eddie Hemmings, India were at 5/204, needing 5 runs an {{over from the}} last 10 overs, with 5 wickets in hand, {{and it looked like}} {{it would be a very}} close game. However, the middle and tailend order for India collapsed, as India lost 5/15. India were {{eventually}} bowled all out for 219 (all out, 45.3 overs), giving England both a berth in the final and a measure of revenge for the loss they suffered to India in the semifinal of the World Cup four years earlier in England.|$|E

Coe eventually fell for 86 made in 150 minutes and the tourists were left to make 351. Challenor and Constantine again gave the West Indians a good start adding 116 for the first wicket. Smith, Percy Goodman and Harold Austin all added useful runs and at 241/4 a surprise win looked possible. Wickets then fell regularly and they ended up 24 runs short.|$|E
25|$|The {{match against}} Lipscomb of the Atlantic Sun Conference was a contest of {{defenses}} {{with the two}} squads managing to get off only three shots in the first half. The Cougars picked up the pace in the second half, but the Bisons' keeper made four of his six saves to hold the home team scoreless. SIUE's defense turned away everything sent at them, but <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> habit of clearing the ball over the end line to set up Lipscomb corner kicks. The game was still scoreless with {{less than two minutes}} remaining in the second extra period when the Bisons set up for their eighth corner of the game. Cougar defenders turned away two Lipscomb headers, but the final clearance rebounded off a charging Bisons forward, falling into the net past a stunned Dal Santo.|$|E
25|$|The transit {{strike was}} the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city {{complete}} control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers' strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> situation worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.|$|E

500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia, many music critics {{considered}} that Smith {{lost much of}} the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits (1997), Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the [...] "grain" [...] in her voice. Jurek went on to write, [...] "It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style." [...] In 1974 Smith released the singles [...] "I Never Knew (What That Song Meant Before)" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Baby on My Mind", which both reached No.13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was {{a tribute to the}} gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular [...] "Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)" [...] as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously-made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles: [...] "(Till) I Kissed You" [...] and [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". After releasing two more studio albums in 1976, Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
