The findings of the case study showed that culture and social relations are very instrumental in the management of the University (Ansari and Bell, 1991). Decisions such as recruitment, rewards, performance evaluation, and resource allocations are often made in cognizance of social and cultural factors. The strong influence of culture and social relations in the organization thus made formal <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> less relevant.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{explores the}} links between <b>management</b> <b>controls,</b> strategy, and {{sustainability}} {{in the context of}} the public sector. Institutional theory is used as a theoretical lens to explore how institutional influences enable or constrain the development of <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> in Belgian local governments, particularly those pertaining to sustainability mobility strategies. Research Method An exploratory case study method was used for the purposes of this study. Further, the package of mobility controls developed by Belgian local governments is explored with reference to the model proposed by Malmi and Brown (2008). The case study utilised semi-structured interviews with mobility managers in four Belgian local governments. To strengthen the analysis, secondary data from these local governments, including reports on mobility, strategy, urban development and infrastructure, were collected and analysed. Findings The four Belgian local governments plan, implement, and control their sustainability mobility strategies differently, depending on their specific practices and routines, and the interactions between relevant actors. Even if sustainability is a strategic component of their urban development, the understanding of the link between sustainability, <b>management</b> <b>controls,</b> and mobility strategy, differs according to local government challenges. Institutional influences are both enabling and constraining the development of <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> in support of sustainability mobility strategies in local governments. More specifically, political support and regulations enable control planning. However, limits in the support of mobility actors, and weak decision power for mobility managers, constrain the monitoring and updating of control indicators. Contribution/Implications This paper contributes to the literature by exploring both institutional enablers and constraints on the development of <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> for sustainability in the public-sector context. More specifically, it explores how practices, routines, and interactions can enable or constrain the potential contribution of <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> to sustainability transitions of local governments.

40|$|AbstractPurpose – Definition of <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework (MCF) had {{undergone}} many changes during {{a short period}} of time. Definition change mostly reflected a scope transformation during this system development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate evolution of <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework, to compare different approaches and discuss outcomes, to propose future development directions based on historical background. It presents a historical revision of different trends of <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> systems in organisations, according to four indicators: scope, outcome, tools and contradictions. Johnson and Kaplan (1987) suggestion was taken as the starting point of current investigation, as it significantly affected viewpoint change and further behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review of publications in public sector, management and accounting journals since 1990 was conducted with the aim to answer the research questions: 1. How <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework are described? 2. What are the main characteristics of MCF? 3. How scope of <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework changed over time. 4. What are the main contradictions? Data analysis was performed using Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, TRIZ), and a special part of this theory — ‘Laws of (technical) systems evolution’ (LTSE). Findings – Overall, the results confirm that <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework (MCF) can be described and trended through Laws of (technical) systems evolution. These findings provide the following insights for future research such as solve contradictions: 1. Overview, but not overload (detalization problem). 2. Subsidiary independent, but over control (HQ involvement problem) 3. Managing Innovation versus Managing Operations (development problem). 4. Differentiation and unification (culture problem). 5. Leadership versus review (GM problem). 6. Common understanding on the control way and results quantification (Measurement identity problem). Research limitations/implications – Generalisation of research results is limited by three main controlling frameworks and Agency theory as additional lever.
