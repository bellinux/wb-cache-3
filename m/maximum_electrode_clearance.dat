One of the advantages is its limited size, which is particularly important for investigations at small scales.

A disadvantage of an excessive discharge is {{the appearance of a}} shockwave. This leads to non-linear effects that make it impossible to acquire reliable impulse responses at small distances from the spark gap.

In this study, blue-black TiO_ 2 nanotube array (BNTA) electrodes are prepared by electrochemical self-doping. The 1 -D structure, donor state density, and Fermi energy level position are critical for maintaining the semimetallic functionality of the BNTA. The structural strength of the BNTA is enhanced by surface crack minimization, reinforcement of the BNTA-Ti metal interface, and stabilized by a protective overcoating with nanoparticulate TiO_ 2 (Ti/EBNTA). Ti/EBNTA electrodes are employed as both anodes and cathodes with polarity switching at a set frequency. Oxidants are generated at the anode, while the doping levels are regenerated along with byproduct reduction at the cathode. The estimated <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> lifetime is 16   895 h.

In these designs, minimization of pathways in the membrane that can support the diffusive transport of product gases from the catalyst to the gas-collecting chamber was required to prevent supersaturation of hydrogen or oxygen gases at the Nafion/catalyst interface. Due to the small, thin membrane layer that was required, a small electrode width (< 300 μm) was also required to produce low resistive losses in the system. Alternatively, incorporation of a structured membrane that balances the gas transport and ionic transport allows the <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> width to be increased to dimensions as large as a few millimeters.

30|$|An {{increase}} in the electrode area causes corresponding increase of coagulants. The entire effectiveness of the coagulation process depended on the appropriate amount of coagulant (Daneshava et al. 2005).

The greater the EA, the greater the rate of flock formation, which in turn influenced the removal efficiency of ET (Chopra and Sharma 2013).

It offers a number of advantages over conventional grinding, such as low induced stress, large depths of cut, and increased wheel life. It has been reported that ECG was employed in machining stainless steel 304, metal-ceramic hard alloy of WC-Co groups, and Tungsten carbide. Inconel 718 is used extensively in aerospace because of their excellent combination of high specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio) which is maintained their fracture resistant characteristics, and their exceptional resistance to corrosion at elevated temperature. The machinability of Inconel 718 is generally considered to be poor owing to several inherent properties of the materials. Poor thermal conductivity, chemically reactivity and low elastic modulus are the common problems. In this paper, ECG is employed to process Inconel 718. To prolong the wheel life, the brazed diamond wheel is introduced to be a tool instead of the electrodeposited diamond wheel.

Spatial and temporal variability was captured during repeated measurements in 2014 and 2015. Concurrently recorded oxygen microelectrode profiles and other sedimentary parameters provide a detailed context for interpretation of the pH data. Clear differences in profiles were observed between sediment type, location and season. Notably, very steep pH gradients exist within the surface sediments (10 – 20 mm), where decreases greater than 0. 5 pH units were observed. Steep gradients were particularly apparent in fine cohesive sediments, less so in permeable sandier matrices. We hypothesise that the gradients are likely caused by aerobic organic matter respiration close to the sediment–water interface or oxidation of reduced species {{at the base of the}} oxic zone (NH 4 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, S−). Statistical analysis suggests the variability in the depth of the pH minima is controlled spatially by the oxygen penetration depth, and seasonally by the input and remineralisation of deposited organic phytodetritus. Below the pH minima the observed pH remained consistently low to <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> penetration (ca. 60 mm), indicating an absence of sub-oxic processes generating H+ or balanced removal processes within this layer.

While enabling the production of well-mixed slurry-cast electrodes with high silicon content (up to 95 wt%), this combination eliminates the well-known occurrence of capacity losses due to physical separation of the silicon and traditional inorganic conductive additives during repeated lithiation/delithiation processes. Using an in situ secondary doping treatment of the PEDOT:PSS with small quantities of formic acid, electrodes containing 80 wt% SiNPs can be prepared with electrical conductivity as high as 4. 2 S/cm. Even at the relatively high mass loading of 1 mg/cm 2, this system demonstrated a first cycle lithiation capacity of 3685 mAh/g (based on the SiNP mass) and a first cycle efficiency of ~ 78 %. After 100 repeated cycles at 1 A/g this electrode was still able to store an impressive 1950 mAh/g normalised to Si mass (~ 75 % capacity retention), corresponding to 1542 mAh/g when the capacity is normalized by the total electrode mass. At the <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> thickness studied (~ 1. 5 mg/cm 2) a high areal capacity of 3 mAh/cm 2 was achieved. Importantly, these electrodes are based on commercially available components and are produced by the standard slurry coating methods required for large-scale electrode production. Hence, the results presented here are highly relevant for the realisation of commercial LiB negative electrodes that surpass the performance of current graphite-based negative electrode systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the structural competence of the subsurface geological materials around Led School Area in Bishini, NW Nigeria to delineate {{the area that}} is suitable for building development. Twenty Seven vertical electrical soundings (VES) points were occupied {{in the study area}} employing ABEM Terrameter SAS 300 C with Schlumberger <b>electrode</b> configuration of <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> separation AB/ 2 = 150 m. The field resistivity data were interpreted using Win RESIST software. The results from the 2 -D interpretation of the VES data were used to prepare the geoelectric sections along four cross sections. The interpreted results showed that the geoelectric sections consist of three to five layers, which are: Top soil, Laterite, Lateritic clay, weathered layer and Fresh basement. The resistivity value and subsurface layer thickness for the top soil varied from 191. 7 Ω m to 8146 Ωm and 0. 3 m to 7. 0 m respectively. The Laterite layer had resistivity values ranging from 1000 Ωm to 1627. 3 Ωm and thickness between 1. 8 m and 2. 5 m. The weathered layer resistivity varied from 33. 5 Ω m to 850 Ω m with thickness of 3. 6 m to 44 m. The bedrock resistivity ranged from 1238. 3 Ωm to 33438. 6 Ωm. Geoelectric sections along profile 4 and 1 revealed the thinnest sequence of loose overburden materials and fresh basement at the shallowest depth. The area covered by these profiles is suitable for building development. Building development should not be located along profiles 2 and 3 due to relatively thick weathered layer. However the area may be considered for citing borehole to harness its groundwater potentials...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{vulnerability}} assessment {{was carried out}} at Igbara Oke Southwestern Nigeria, {{with a view to}} classify the area into vulnerability zones, by applying the electrical resistivity method, using Schlumberger <b>electrode</b> arrays with <b>maximum</b> <b>electrode</b> separation (AB/ 2) of 65 Â m in (41) different locations for data acquisition. Geoelectric parameters (layer resistivity and thickness) were determined from the interpreted data. The study area comprises four geoelectric layers (topsoil, lateritic layer, weathered/fractured layer and fresh basement). The geoelectric parameters of the overlying layers across the area were used to assess the vulnerability of the underlying aquifers to near-surface contaminants with the aid of vulnerability maps generated. Three models were compared by maps using geo-electrically derived models; longitudinal conductance, GOD (groundwater occurrence, overlying lithology and depth to the aquifer) and GLSI (geoelectric layer susceptibility indexing). The total longitudinal conductance map shows the north central part of the study area as a weakly protected (0. 1 â 0. 19) area, while the northern and southern parts have poor protective capacity (< 0. 1); this is in agreement with the GOD method which shows {{the northern part of the}} study area as less vulnerable (0 â 0. 1) while the southern part has low/moderate (0. 1 â 0. 3) vulnerability to contamination. The longitudinal conductance exaggerates the degree of susceptibility to contamination than the GOD and GLSI models. From the models, vulnerability to contamination can be considered higher at the southern part than the northern part and therefore, sources of contamination like septic tank, refuse dump should be cited far from groundwater development area.

40|$|The {{corrosivity}} of the {{top three}} metres of the soil along a pipeline route was determined using soil electrical resistivity for the emplacement of a conduit intended to serve as a gas pipeline. Fifty-six Schlumberger vertical electrical soundings (VES) were carried using a <b>maximum</b> current <b>electrode</b> separation ranging between 24 - 100 m at 2. 0 km interval. The data was interpreted using a 1 D inversion technique software (1 X 1 D, Interpex, USA). Model resistivity values were classified in terms of the degree of corrosivity. Generally, the sub-soil condition along the pipeline route is non-aggressive but being slightly or moderately aggressive in certain areas due to local conditions prevailing at the measuring stations. Based on the corrosivity along the pipeline route, appropriate cathodic protection methods are prescribed. </p...|$|R

30|$|A {{total of}} 17 VES with Schlumberger {{configuration}} {{were carried out}} {{for the present study}} (Fig.  1 d). The VES were carried out with SYSCAL R 2 resistivity meter which uses 12  v car battery with a transformer as current injecting source. The <b>maximum</b> current <b>electrode</b> separation (AB) for the VES ranged from 500 to 1800  m. The potential electrodes’ separation was (MN) increased accordingly, i.e., from 1 to 80  m so that the measured voltage never fell below 5 units. A minimum of five stacks (current was injected into the ground five times and its responses were added and averaged out for the particular measurement) were taken for each measurement, keeping signal to noise ratio zero. A preliminary appraisal of the VES curves has provided a good insight into the hydrogeological conditions of the study area. A good look at the shape of the sounding curve and ranges of the apparent resistivity values enable dividing the curves into groups. Each group represents a specific geologic or hydrogeological condition.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Geophysical survey {{based on}} “Schlumberger ” array of {{vertical}} electrical sounding (VES) {{was carried out}} to study the quantity of clay deposits in Delta North District, Nigeria. Obviously, the quantity of clay deposit depends on its thickness. Previous researchers did not {{work in this area}} primarily to search for the clay deposit. The need to prospect or search for clay deposits in this area became inevitable so as {{to solve the problem of}} youth restiveness in the area by way of setting up industries in Delta North district that rely on clay for manufacturing purposes. Ten (10) VES, uniformly distributed in six different stations in Agbor were carried out using six (06) points per decade with <b>maximum</b> current <b>electrode</b> spacing of 928. 0 m. The software IP 12 WIN utilizing computer iteration was used for interpretation of apparent resistivity data. The result of the resistivity survey showed that clay and clayey soil (clay mixed with other rock types) were present. The depths and thicknesses of each clay formation were then ascertained. Depths to probable clay formations varied from 0. 5 m to 90 m while the thicknesses varied from 0. 95 m to 7. 00 m...|$|R
