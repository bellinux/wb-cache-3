Para-fluoro substitution with different (thio) carbonylthio reagents was possible and allowed for subsequent one-pot cleavage of dithioester pendent groups with concurrent thia-Michael side group modification. Reactions with aliphatic amines (typically 2. 5 equiv amine, 50 – 60 °C, overnight) resulted in complete substitution of the para-fluorides without any observed ester cleavage reactions.

Entretanto há limitações para a aplicação dos azopolímeros devido à tendência à agregação dos cromóforos e dificuldade de formação de filmes. A mistura do azopolímero com polímeros metacrílicos e poli(3 -alquiltiofenos) pode melhorar estas características sem acarretar prejuízos para a propriedade de isomerização fotoinduzida. Neste estudo o azopolímero foi sintetizado por ATRP usando o monômero DR 1 -MA, 4 -[N-etil-N-(2 -metacriloxietil) ]- 4 - nitroazobenzeno, obtido a partir do corante Disperse Red 1 (DR 1), os polímeros poli(metacrilato de hexila) (HPHex-MA) e poli(metacrilato de dodecila) (HPDod-MA) foram sintetizados por polimerização radicalar convencional a partir dos monômeros obtidos comercialmente e o poli(3 -dodeciltiofeno) (HP 3 -DodT) obtido por polimerização oxidativa. As polimerizações foram bem sucedidas apresentando massas molares acima de 10. 000 g/mol com polidispersividade relativamente baixa. As estruturas químicas foram confirmadas por espectroscopias UV-Vis, FTIR e RMN-H 1. Misturas do azopolímero com os polímeros metacrílicos e o poli(3 -alquiltiofeno) foram preparadas em diversas proporções e usadas na formação de filmes de Langmuir. Nestes filmes, isotermas de pressão de superfície apontaram interações para as três misturas em algumas proporções, entre elas a de 50 %. Imagens de microscopia no ângulo de Brewster revelaram a contribuição do polímero metacrílico no espalhamento do filme do azopolímero sem a separação de fase. Os resultados de Espectroscopia de Infravermelho por Reflexão e Absorção com Polarização Modulada (PM-IRRAS) comprovaram que o comprimento da cadeia lateral do polímero afeta a organização {{molecular}} na interface. Filmes de Langmuir das misturas na proporção de 50 % foram transferidos em substratos sólidos, obtendo os filmes Langmuir-Blodgett (LB). Comparações entre os filmes spin-coated e Langmuir-Blodgett mostraram que a organização molecular nos filmes nanoestruturados causa a redução na agregação de cromóforos e na hidrofobicidade da superfície. Filmes LB da mistura 50 % HPDR 1 -MA/HPDod-MA com 101 camadas foram caracterizados quanto à capacidade de armazenamento óptico. Estes filmes apresentaram valores de birrefringência residual que permitem ser aplicados em armazenamento óptico com a vantagem de curtos tempos de escrita em comparação a outros filmes poliméricos. Polymeric {{materials with}} photoisomerization properties, {{such as the}} azopolymers, offer great potential for applications in non-linear optics and opto electronic devices. However, there are important limitations {{for the application of}} azopolymers, since azopolymers with high content of azobenzene moieties tend to aggregate and show poor film-formation properties. The combination of azopolymers with methacrylic polymers and poly (3 -alkylthiophenes) can improve their properties without reducing the optical storage capability. In this study, the azopolymer poly[4 -[[2 -(methacryloyloxy) -ethyl]ethylamino]- 4 -nitroazobenzene], HPDR 1 -MA, was synthesized by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP), the poly (hexylmethacrylate) (HPHex-MA) and poly(dodecylmethacrylate) (HPDod-MA) were synthesized by conventional radical polymerization, the poly(3 -dodecylthiophene) (HP 3 -DodT) via oxidative polymerization. The polymerizations were successful with molecular weights above 10. 000 g/mol and relatively low polydispersities. The chemical structures were confirmed with UV-Vis, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Mixtures of azopolymer with the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> and poly(3 -alkylthiophenes) were prepared in various proportions and used in the formation of Langmuir films. In the latter, surface pressure isotherms indicated interactions between the film components, mainly for a proportion of 50 % in weight of HPDR 1 -MA. Phase segregation was not apparent in the BAM images, which revealed that the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> improves the formation of the film Langmuir. Through PM-IRRAS, we noted that the length of the side chain of the polymer affects the molecular organization at the interface. Langmuir films of the mixtures in the proportion of 50 % were transferred onto solid supports as Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Comparison of LB and spin-coated films demonstrated that the molecular organization of nanostructured films prevents the aggregation of chromophores and reduces the surface hydrophobicity. Optical Storage measurements were performed in 101 -layer LB films of the mixture 50 % HPDR 1 -MA/HPDod-MA. The photoinduced birefringence shows features that make these films useful for optical storage, with the advantage of short writing times in comparison to other azopolymer films...|$|E

Combined with {{the sum of}} the end-group masses as determined from MS data, this main reaction allowed both end-groups to be validated. In contrast, loss of HCOOR (with R = triisopropylsilyl) or elimination of alkene species from alkylsilyl groups, such as reported from poly(butylmethacrylate), was not observed here, probably due to steric hindrance of the pendant moieties. Activation of ammonium oligomer adducts was found to provide highly complementary information, since they exhibited a similar behavior as compared to poly(methacrylic acid), with serial eliminations of a triisopropylsilanol neutral conducting to the determination of the polymerization degree of the dissociating precursor ion. It should be noted however that this useful pathway was not always observed to efficiently compete with dissociation of reactive omega end-groups. Based on these fragmentation rules, five poly(triisopropylsilyl methacrylate) s were identified in a sample obtained via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using cyanoisopropyl dithiobenzoate as the chain transfer agent. Their structure could be rationalized with regards to RAFT processes: (i) dormant chains initiated by a cyanoisopropyl group and terminated by a dithiobenzoate group, as the main species: (ii) proton- and (iii) vinyl-terminated dead chains produced by disproportionation termination events: (iv) alpha,omega-cyanoisopropyl-terminated polymer chains arising from a combination termination between two macromolecular propagating radicals, and (v) dormant chains containing methacrylic acid monomer units within the chain.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the preparation of <b>methacrylic</b> monomers and <b>polymers</b> carrying acyl b-amino groups is presented. The approach {{is based on the}} Michael addition of aliphatic amines onto asymmetric acrylic/metha-crylic compounds, reacting the amine highly selectively with the acrylic unit while leaving the methacrylic moiety unreacted. The corresponding polymers are then obtained by conven-tional radical polymerization. The use of N,N,N 0,N 0 -tetraethyl-diethylenetriamine (TEDETA) as the secondary amine leads to TEDETA moieties supported on polymeric chains. The new aminopolymers are sensitive to pH and to temperature exhibit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} and characterisation of novel <b>methacrylic</b> based <b>polymer</b> electrolyte membranes for lithium batteries. The method adopted for preparing the solid polymer electrolyte was the UV-curing process, which {{is well known}} for being easy, low cost, fast and reliable. It consists of a free radical photo polymerisation of poly-functional monomers: Bisphenol A ethoxylate (15 EO/phenol) dimethacrylate (BEMA) was chosen, as it can readily form ﬂexible 3 D networks and has long poly-ethoxy chains which can enhance the movement of Li+-ions inside the polymer matrix. The preliminary results reported here refer to systemswhere LiPF 6 solutions swelled the preformed polymermembranes. The tests on the conductivity, stability and cyclability of the membranes put in evidence the importance of the polymerisation in presence of mono-methacrylates acting as reactive diluents. Good values of ionic conductivity have been found, especially at ambient temperature. Much better results can be expected by choosing an appropriate mono-methacrylate to modify the polymeric membrane properties and by modifying the methodology of Li+-ions incorporation inside the polymer matri...|$|R

Herein, a new method to modify the bromine end group into a thiol functionality in (meth) acrylic polymers synthesized by ATRP is reported for the first time. Thus, the bromine end group of several poly(methyl methacrylate) s was successfully converted into a thioacetate {{and then in a}} mercapto group by a controlled hydrolysis.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method to fabricate pH-responsive microparticles suitable for oral delivery using an aqueous-based spray-drying approach. The approach involves the neutralization and generation of water-soluble salt forms of enteric <b>polymers.</b> The <b>methacrylic</b> acid <b>polymers</b> (Eudragit L and Eudragit S) were added separately to aqueous solutions of ammonium hydrogen carbonate; the solutions were then spray-dried. FTIR {{analysis of the}} harvested microparticle products identified the presence of ammonium methacrylate {{with the appearance of}} a peak at 1550 cm− 1 corresponding to the stretching of the N–H bond. Incubating the microparticles for three hours at 70 °C and 130 °C for the Eudragit S and L products, respectively, was sufficient to eradicate the ammonium residues. The microparticles, loaded with the model drug prednisolone, were spherical and small in size (2 – 5 μm). Moreover, the particles were gastro-resistant, and release was rapid and complete at small intestinal conditions. The pH threshold of release of the Eudragit S and Eudragit L microparticles was lowered from 7 and 6 to 6. 5 and 5. 5, respectively. In bicarbonate media, which are physiological and representative of the conditions of the proximal small intestine (mHanks) and the distal small intestine (Kreb’s), drug release from these spray-dried microparticles was faster compared to microparticles produced from conventional emulsion solvent evaporation methods. This new microparticle preparation concept obviates the need for organic solvents and utilizes spray-drying techniques that are amenable to industrial application; the approach therefore offers economic, safety, and environmental benefits...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{possibility}} of producing highly porous pellets of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was examined. High porosity is expected to reduce the density of pellets and affect the gastric emptying. Furthermore, {{it is expected to}} improve the loading ability. Initially were examined the effects of MCC type, of wetting liquid and drying method on the micromeritic, mechanical and disintegration properties of MCC pellets. Extrusion/spheronization was applied by using three types of MCC powder (Avicel®, Prosolv® and modified Avicel®) and two wetting liquids (water or water-isopropanol 60 : 40 w/w). Also, highly porous Avicel® pellets were prepared by the incorporation and extraction of pore former (NaCl). All the wet pellets were dried by employing three methods (fluidized bed, microwaves and freeze drying). It was found that the drying method has the greatest effect on the pellet size and porosity followed by the wetting liquid. Combination of water-isopropanol, freeze drying and modified MCC gave the greatest increase in pellet size and porosity. The increase in pellet porosity caused reduction in the resistance to deformation, tensile strength and disintegration time. Since the freeze drying caused the greatest increase on pellet porosity, the effects of initial freezing conditions (before the sublimation) on the pore volume and pore size distribution were evaluated. Freeze drying was applied after initial freezing under three different conditions (- 30, - 80 and - 197 oC). Pellet porosity was found to increase with decreasing initial freezing temperature. The mean pore diameter was greater for the extracted pellets, followed by non extracted pellets made with water and water-isopropanol. Also, the pore diameter was greater for freezing at - 80 o C while it was smaller at - 197 o C. It was also noticed that the size of the pores formed by extraction of pore former is much smaller than that of pore former particles. This may be caused by the presence of “ink-bottle” pores. Therefore, pore shape of pellets was estimated by repeated mercury porosimetry and evaluation of mercury entrapment. From the mercury reintrusion {{it was found that the}} volumes of the second intrusion are considerably lower compared to the volumes of the first intrusion. Freeze-dried non-extracted pellets show lower formation of “ink-bottle” pores than fluidized bed dried pellets. Furthermore, water-isopropanol as wetting liquid results in higher “ink-bottle” percentage than water. The decrease of initial freezing temperature reduces the “ink-bottle” formation only when water is used as the granulating liquid. For the evaluation of drug loading ability as well as the release properties of porous pellets, MCC pellets with small pores or large pores were used. The pellets after loading by immersion in aqueous solution of riboflavin under vacuum and drying were coated with enteric and colonic coatings using <b>methacrylic</b> <b>polymers.</b> The requirements for effective gastroresistant coating and the release before and after coating were also evaluated. It was found that: a) The drug loading ability was higher for the pellets with large pores. b) The drug release from the non coated pellets was immediate, controlled by diffusion and faster for pellets with large pores. c) The required polymer dispersion for the effective gastro-resistance was higher for the case of pellets with large pores and the profile of drug release was delayed and reduced with the increase of the coating applied. ...|$|R
40|$|Microstructure in two diblock <b>methacrylic</b> azo <b>polymers</b> {{and in some}} {{of their}} blends with PMMA of {{different}} molecular weights {{as well as their}} photoinduced anisotropy have been investigated. The block copolymers have similar structure but different azo content and degree of polymerization. A synthetic strategy based on a controlled radical polymerization (ATRP) of polymeric blocks and their coupling by click chemistry has been applied to obtain an azo block copolymer of high molecular weight. Microphase segregation has been observed in the block copolymers and in most of the blends. In blends of the block copolymer with lower degree of polymerization (Block 1) azo microdomains change from lamellar to spherical morphology when the azo content decreases from 24 to 3 wt. %. In the block copolymer with higher degree of polymerization (Block 2) and its blends, down to 3 wt. % azo content, spherical azo microdomains have been found. A decrease of the order parameter (Î·) and the photoinduced birefringence normalized to the azo content (|Î”n| norm) has been found in blends of Block 1 when the azo content decreases. However, |Î”n| norm and Î· values similar to those in the azo homopolymer have been observed in Block 2 and its blends. These blends can be used to lower the azo content while keeping a photoinduced response similar to that in the azo homopolymer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: Sustained-release floating tablets of ITO hydrochloride (HCl) were prepared by direct compression using different hydrocolloid polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and ethylcellulose and/or <b>methacrylic</b> acid <b>polymers</b> Eudragit RSPM and Carbopol 934 P. The floating property was achieved using an effervescent mixture of sodium bicarbonate and anhydrous citric acid (1 : 1  mol/mol). Hardness, friability, content uniformity, and dissolution rate of the prepared floating tablets were evaluated. The formulation F 10 composed of 28. 5 % Eudragit RSPM, 3 % NaHCO 3, and 7 % citric acid provided sustained drug release. Results: In vitro results showed sustained release of F 10 where the drug release percentage was 96. 51 %± 1. 75 % after 24  hours (P= 0. 031). The pharmacokinetic results indicated that the area under the curve (AUC 0 –∞) of the prepared sustained-release floating tablets at infinity achieved 93. 69  µg·h/mL compared to 49. 89  µg·h/mL for the reference formulation (Ganaton®) and the relative bioavailability of the sustained-release formulation F 10 increased to 187. 80 % (P= 0. 022). Conclusion: The prepared floating tablets of ITO HCl (F 10) could be a promising drug delivery system with sustained-release action and enhanced drug bioavailability.
