5|$|As news of Gen. Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} on April 9, 1865, {{reached the}} department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner {{his chief of}} staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender. Smith had instead instructed Buckner to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> the troops to Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had {{a light and}} a heavy attack, which could be {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing <b>move.</b> <b>All</b> attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} of Sandakan {{as the capital}} of North Borneo was however ended when the Japanese occupied the town on 19 January 1942. During their occupation, the Japanese restored the town's previous name, Elopura and established {{a prisoner of war}} camp to hold their captive enemies. Allied planes started to raid Sandakan in September 1944. As the Japanese feared further retaliation from the Allied forces, they began to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> prisoners and forced them to march to Ranau. Thousands of British and Australian soldiers lost their lives during this forced march in addition to Javanese labourers from the Dutch East Indies. Only six Australian soldiers survived from this camp, all after escaping. Sandakan was completely destroyed both by bombing from Allied forces and by the Japanese occupation.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm had}} several {{long-term}} consequences. Complaints against the USDA Weather Bureau of alleged unpreparedness resulted in increased efforts to achieve more accurate weather forecasting and faster realization and communication of proper storm warnings. Criticism of the shipping companies and shipbuilders {{led to a}} series of conferences with insurers and mariners to seek safer designs for vessels. This resulted in the construction of ships with greater stability and more longitudinal strength. Immediately following the blizzard of Cleveland, Ohio, the city began a campaign to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> utility cables underground, in tubes beneath major streets. The project took half a decade.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean {{to do the best}} he could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> the remaining evacuees into the parking lot LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who displayed their logo on the building. Shows such as What Now, After School, Simon Barnett's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed {{in the tower}} block. TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington. In the late 1990s, Telstra New Zealand, the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand, owned the naming rights to the building. After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form TelstraClear, the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building. The building's naming rights were sold to The Radio Network and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB, a subsidiary of The Radio Network, was displayed on the building.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to <b>move</b> <b>all</b> series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E

25|$|In Stoical Go, {{invented by}} {{abstract}} game designer Luis Bolaños Mures, standard ko rules don't apply.

25|$|If ρ = 0, {{then the}} fixed points are neither {{attractive}} nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation {{is said to}} be elliptic.
