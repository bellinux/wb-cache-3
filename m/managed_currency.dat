50|$|<b>Managed</b> <b>currency</b> {{mortgages}} {{can help}} to reduce risk exposure. A borrower can allow a specialist currency manager to manage their loan on their behalf (through a limited power of attorney), where the currency manager will switch the borrower's debt {{in and out of}} foreign currencies as they change in value against the base currency. A successful currency manager will move the borrower's debt into a currency which subsequently falls in value against the base currency. The manager can then switch the loan back into the base currency (or another weakening currency) at a better exchange rate, thereby reducing the value of the loan. A further benefit of this product is that the currency manager will try to select currencies with a lower interest rate than the base currency, and the borrower therefore can make substantial interest savings.|$|E

40|$|This essay reviews J. R. Commons 2 ̆ 7 {{argument}} on <b>managed</b> <b>currency.</b> The view on money of J. R. Commons, {{one of the}} pioneers of institutional economics, has only recently attracted attention. As previous studies have pointed out, Commons was one of the early advocates of <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> in the U. S. He supported the plan of issuing silver bullion notes to manage the price level in the 1890 s. In the late 1920 s, he put strongly his hope on the Federal Reserve System to stabilize price level. Commons consistently stressed the public purpose of <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> and justice between classes. He regarded the class conflict as normalcy and hoped that the FRB contributed to achieve justice between classes in way of using an index number of prices weighed according to the industry population in the late 1920 s. At the same time, he expressed concern about the FRB subject to private purpose. After the Crash in 1929, he intensely criticized the FRB for having been controlled by the bankers. In particular, he criticized that the FRB had not made measures against the rapid rise of securities price before the Crash. The insight of Commons should be revaluated precisely because we are {{in the age of the}} repeated financial crises...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is a set of {{problems}} concerning international and foreign exchange banking reserves in national economy. The working of reserves in bath the gold currency system and the <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> system has been presented in this paper. Metallic currency serves a double purpose in the gold currency system, namely as an internal reserve and a foreign exchange reserve. The internal reserve is a regulator of money circulation. The foreign exchange reserve governs the equilibrium of the balance of payment. Next the working of reserves in the <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> system has been examined. In that system there is a division of internal and international tasks in the sphere of reserves. The functions of foreign exchange reserves have been described. They consist in guaranteeing international liquidity and currency stability. Next the structure of foreign exchange reserves has been described. Distinction between owned and borrowed reserves has been drawn. The role of gold, of key currencies and international credits has been analyzed. The importance of the new international reserve unit has been emphasized, i. e. the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund. The problem of cost of keeping foreign exchange reserves and the rule of forming them have been discussed as well. The study of foreign exchange reserves has been supplemented with an analysis of reserve policy in the socialistic economy.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to equip the {{investor}} with the tools and understanding necessary to evaluate managed currencies' investments in a meaningful way. It is shown that <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> funds might exhibit a common factor because most of the trading managers use similar technical forecasts to trigger their positions in the financial markets. Therefore, a dynamic benchmark is built, based on technical trading rules. Using the stochastic properties of trading rules, three simple moving averages are selected and given equal weight. Then the basket of trading rules is applied to a set of currencies. The weighting between currencies is done according to volumes traded on the OTC market as observed through Reuters 2000. Such a dynamic benchmark when adjusted for the leverage and risk-free factors exhibits similar performances, namely returns and volatility, to currency traders' benchmarks. The degree of correlation is high and the tracking error is low. These results might have several implications for institutions wishing to consider <b>managed</b> <b>currency</b> funds. First, the dynamic index might be used as a test of market inefficiencies. Second, the technical index might be used as a benchmark for currency trading advisers. As a whole, it can be seen that managed currencies have been trend-followers because the correlation coefficient between the dynamic index and the currency managers is significantly positive. The dynamic index might well be used to distinguish trend-followers from contrarian and judgemental fund. Finally, the dynamic index might be used as a tool to fulfil market expectations. On the one hand, an investor anticipating trending markets might wish to buy the dynamic index. On the other hand, an investor forecasting range-trading markets might wish to sell the index. In sum, the dynamic index might constitute a new financial product, as well as an appropriate benchmark for managed currencies funds. Benchmark;Currencies;Trend;Trading;Rules,...|$|E
