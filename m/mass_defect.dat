Its relation E=mc2 suggested that matter {{was a form of}} energy, which was later verified by the <b>mass</b> <b>defect</b> in atomic nuclei.

2500|$|The {{question}} of whether the neutron was a composite particle of a proton and an electron persisted for a few years after its discovery. In 1932 Harrie Massey explored a model for a composite neutron to account for its great penetrating power through matter and its electrical neutrality, for example. The issue was a legacy of the prevailing view from the 1920s that the only elementary particles were the proton and electron. The nature of the neutron was a primary topic of discussion at the 7th Solvay Conference held in October 1933, attended by Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Lise Meitner, Ernest Lawrence, Fermi, Chadwick, and others. As posed by Chadwick in his Bakerian Lecture in 1933, the primary question was the mass of the neutron relative to the proton. If the neutron's mass was less than the combined masses of a proton and an electron (...) , then the neutron could be a proton-electron composite because of the <b>mass</b> <b>defect</b> from the binding energy. If greater than the combined masses, then the neutron was elementary like the proton. The question was challenging to answer because the electron's mass is only 0.05% of the proton's, hence precise measurements were required.|$|E
2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a high-resolution technique {{that can be used}} to determine masses with high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the <b>mass</b> <b>defect</b> of the elements. FTICR-MS is able to achieve higher levels of mass accuracy than other forms of mass spectrometer, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than radio-frequency (RF) voltage. [...] Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures, such as biomass or waste liquefaction products, since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) to be detected as distinct ions. [...] This high resolution is also useful in studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges, which can be produced by electrospray ionization. For example, attomole level of detection of two peptides has been reported. [...] These large molecules contain a distribution of isotopes that produce a series of isotopic peaks. Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the m/z axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful. FTICR-MS is very useful in other studies of proteomics as well. It achieves exceptional resolution in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD), collisional-induced dissociation (CID), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) are all utilized to produce fragment spectra in tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Although CID and IRMPD use vibrational excitation to further dissociate peptides by breaking the backbone amide linkages, which are typically low in energy and weak, CID and IRMPD may also cause dissociation of post-translational modifications. ECD, on the other hand, allows specific modifications to be preserved. This is quite useful in analyzing phosphorylation states, O- or N-linked glycosylation, and sulfating.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{general aspects}} of the <b>mass</b> <b>defects</b> of strange stars {{in the context of}} the Field Correlator Method, without magnetic field. The main parameters of the model that enter the corresponding nonperturbative equation of state of the quark gluon plasma are the gluon condensate G_ 2 and the large distance static QQ̅ potential V_ 1. We calculate <b>mass</b> <b>defects</b> of stellar configurations in the central density range 11 <ρ_c< 18. In general, the <b>mass</b> <b>defects</b> are strongly dependent on the model parameters. For a large range of values of G_ 2 and V_ 1, we obtain anomalous <b>mass</b> <b>defects</b> with magnitudes around 10 ^ 53 erg, of the same order of the observed energies of gamma-ray bursts and neutrino emissions in SN 1987 A, and of the theoretically predicted energies of the quark-novae explosions.

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} and theoretically {{the properties}} of structural defects (kink solitons) in two-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals. We show how different types of kink solitons with different physical properties can be realized, and transformed from one type into another by varying the aspect ratio of the trap confinement. Further, we discuss how impurities in ion Coulomb crystals, such as <b>mass</b> <b>defects,</b> can modify the dynamics of kink creation and their stability. For both pure and impure crystals, the experimentally observed kink dynamics are analyzed in detail and explained theoretically by numerical simulations and calculations of the Peierls-Nabarro potential.

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{mass spectrometry}} (HRMS) was successfully applied to elucidate {{the structure of}} a polyfluorinated polyether (PFPE) -based formulation. The mass spectrum generated from direct injection into the MS was examined by identifying the different repeating units manually and with the aid of an instrument data processor. Highly accurate mass spectral data enabled the calculation of higher-order <b>mass</b> <b>defects.</b> The different plots of MW and the nth-order <b>mass</b> <b>defects</b> (up to n = 3) could aid in assessing the structure of the different repeating units and estimating their absolute and relative number per molecule. The three major repeating units were -C 2 H 4 O-, -C 2 F 4 O-, and -CF 2 O-. Tandem MS was used to identify the end groups that appeared to be phosphates, as well as the possible distribution of the repeating units. Reversed-phase HPLC separated of the polymer molecules on the basis of number of nonpolar repeating units. The elucidated structure resembles the structure in the published manufacturer technical data. This analytical approach to the characterization of a PFPE-based formulation can serve as a guide in analyzing not just other PFPE-based formulations but also other fluorinated and non-fluorinated polymers. The information from MS is essential in studying the physico-chemical properties of PFPEs and can help in assessing the risks they pose to the environment and to human health...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor B-Myb {{is present in}} all proliferating cells, and in mice engineered to remove this gene, embryos die in utero just after implantation due to inner cell <b>mass</b> <b>defects.</b> This lethal phenotype has generally been attributed to a proliferation defect in the cell cycle phase of G 1.

40|$|We study {{frequency}} conversion in nonlinear mechanical lattices, {{focusing on a}} chain of magnets as a model system.

The nonlinear interaction introduces an energy transfer from the high-frequency localized modes to a low-frequency extended mode. This system is capable of autonomously converting energy between highly tunable input and output frequencies, which need not be related by integer harmonic or subharmonic ratios. It is also capable of obtaining energy from multiple sources at different frequencies with a tunable output phase, due to the defect synchronization provided by the extended mode.

40|$|SummaryMutations in PERK (EIF 2 AK 3) {{result in}} {{permanent}} neonatal diabetes {{as well as}} several other anomalies that underlie the human Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, and these anomalies are mirrored in Perk knockout mice. To identify the cause of diabetes in PERK-deficient mice, we generated a series of tissue- and cell-specific knockouts of the Perk gene and performed a developmental analysis of the progression to overt diabetes. We discovered that PERK is specifically required in the insulin-secreting β cells during the fetal and early neonatal period as a prerequisite for postnatal glucose homeostasis. However, PERK expression in β cells is not required at the adult stage to maintain β cell functions and glucose homeostasis. We show that PERK-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in fetal/neonatal β cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in low β cell <b>mass,</b> <b>defects</b> in proinsulin trafficking, and abrogation of insulin secretion that culminate in permanent neonatal diabetes...|$|R
