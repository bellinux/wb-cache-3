25|$|Size of {{individual}} drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside {{diameter of the}} basket. However, it may less commonly also be {{the diameter of the}} cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If the loudspeaker has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.|$|E
25|$|A Forstner bit could {{bore the}} <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> for the hinge, but {{particle}} board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex {{shape of a}} forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.|$|E

50|$|The {{dimensions}} and <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> must suit {{the equipment that}} uses the fan. Square-framed fans are usually used, but round frames are also used, often so that a larger fan than the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> would otherwise allow can be used (e.g., a 120 mm fan with holes for the corners of a 90 mm square fan). The width of square fans and the diameter of round ones are usually stated in millimeters. The dimension given is the outside width of the fan, not the distance between <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> Common sizes include 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 92 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm, although8 mm, 17 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 38 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 70 mm, 250 mm and 360 mm sizes are also available. Heights are typically 10 mm, 25 mm or 38 mm, but this is usually not an important dimension as it does not affect <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> or apertures in the case.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 610 socket {{was provided}} with two <b>mounting</b> <b>holes,</b> one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be secured using two screws, with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, {{using the same}} two <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> but {{with one of the}} screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{rubberized}} {{fuel tank}} {{was found to}} have failed in the collar band regions. The failure was by tensile tearing along the line joining the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> It appears most probable that improper tightening of the mounting brackets and/or nonconformities in the dimension of the rubberized fuel tank would have resulted in the tensile load in the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> No material abnormalities appear to be responsible for the failure...|$|R

50|$|The SSI CEB {{specification}} {{was derived}} from the EEB and ATX specifications. SSI CEB motherboards have the same IO connector area and many of the same motherboard <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> as ATX motherboards, although SSI CEB motherboards are larger in size than ATX motherboards and have different processor <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The rear panel aperture is identical to the EEB and ATX specification and expansion cards mounted on an SSI CEB motherboard appear much the same as they would on an ATX motherboard.|$|R

50|$|In 1956, the Canadian {{provinces and}} U.S. states {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, Automobile Manufacturers Association, and National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles, except those for motorcycles, at 15cm in height X 30cm in width (6 inches X 12 inches in the U.S.), with standardized <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The 1955 (dated 1956) issue was the Northwest Territories' first licence plate that complied with these standards. The current bear-shaped plates feature the standardized <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the U.S. {{states and}} Canadian provinces {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the Automobile Manufacturers Association and the National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for motorcycles) at 6 in in height by 12 in in width, with standardized <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The 1956 (dated 1957) issue was the first Illinois license plate that fully complied with these standards: the 1955 (dated 1956) issue was 6 inches in height by 12 inches in width, but had non-standard <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The entire {{computer}} {{was difficult to}} assemble in the factory as the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> in the motherboard did not line up with the threaded mounts molded into the case.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> {{arrangement}} is vertically symmetric, {{it is possible}} to mount rack-mountable equipment upside-down. However, not all equipment is suitable for this type of mounting. For instance, most optical disc players will not work upside-down because the driving motor mechanism does not grip the disc.|$|E
5000|$|Downhauls also vary. Original upper vang {{block is}} mounted {{halfway between the}} goose neck and the main sheet block. There is a {{stainless}} bail with a <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> bolted to the mast - vang block with built-in cleat can be mounted to it. Downhaul setup offers 3:1 purchase.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} ILM exist, with {{different}} shapes and heatsink <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> patterns: square ILM (80×80 mm mounting pattern), and narrow ILM (56×94 mm mounting pattern). Square ILM {{is the standard}} type, while the narrow one is alternatively available for space-constrained applications. [...] A matching heatsink is required for each ILM type.|$|E
50|$|While {{most modern}} vehicle emblems are {{attached}} with adhesive {{and can be}} easily removed, some emblems require varying degrees of bodywork to fill in voids and <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> left behind.|$|R

50|$|Bash valves {{have also}} been used for the ad hoc {{conversion}} of commonplace petrol small engines, such as lawnmowers, into hobbyist steam engines. The original petrol engine sparkplug <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> is used as the location for a new piston-actuated bash valve, together with the original exhaust valve. Performance and efficiency are not a need of such projects.|$|E
50|$|Subframes {{are prone}} to misalignment, which can cause {{vibration}} and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components. Misalignment is caused by space between the chassis-subframe mounting bolts and the <b>mounting</b> <b>hole.</b> There {{are a number of}} companies in the automotive aftermarket that offer solutions for the subframe misalignment and movement issue, including TyrolSport of the USA and Spoon Sports of Japan.|$|E

50|$|The D2PAK or DDPAK, {{standardized}} as TO-263, {{refers to}} a semiconductor package type intended for surface mounting on circuit boards. They {{are similar to the}} earlier TO-220-style packages intended for high power dissipation but lack the extended metal tab and <b>mounting</b> <b>hole,</b> and also represent a larger version of the DPAK SMT package.As with all SMT packages, the pins on a D2PAK are bent to lie against the PCB surface.|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{mounting}} holes in racks where {{the equipment is}} frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off; both problems render the <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> unusable. Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes. Examples include telephone exchanges, network cabling panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.|$|E
