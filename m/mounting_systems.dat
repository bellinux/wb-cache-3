Aiming at the vibration problem of passenger cars, {{this paper presents}} an optimal method for powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> which bases on energy decoupling method. Firstly, a six-freedom dynamic model of powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> of passenger cars is established. Then, an optimal process of <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is conducted by using the theory of energy decoupling with maximizing decoupling rate of the six-freedom <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> as objective.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{computational}} models for commercial vehicle engine vibration dynamics are presented. The first model is conventional elastomeric engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour {{of the dynamic}} stiffness and damping of the engine mounts as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric mounts making the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> an adaptronic one. Parameter optimization of the proposed adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> has been done. Computational models are implemented in Matlab /Simulink with GUI suitable for engine vibration dynamics analysis under different engine excitations and realistic road inputs. Simulations of engine vibration and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure are presented which are obtained by using both computational models for the same inputs of engine and road excitations. Comparison of the obtained results for adaptronic <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> (AMS) to the corresponding results of conventional <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> (CMS) demonstrates up to % 24 reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} transmitted force to the vehicle structure achieved with adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> that includes two actuators with forces not exceeding 50 (N) ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete design {{process of the}} <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. According to the actual state of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> the 6 -DOF vibration model is established. The natural frequency and vibration mode are obtained using eigenvalue analysis. Considering the low-frequency vibration decoupling rate as the objective function, the design parameters (including mount hardness, thickness, and stiffness in all directions) that render the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured are extracted, and the optimal parameters are used to design the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Subsequently, the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is simulated and analyzed to study the vibration response. The torsional excitation of the shafting is calculated as the transmission excitation using the equivalent model, and the road excitation is simulated using the sinusoidal scanning signal based on the data of acceleration measured by the actual vehicle. A comprehensive analysis shows that the strength and dynamic characteristics of the front mount should be improved, and hence, topology optimization {{is applied to the}} metal frame. Finally, the vibration bench test of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is carried out to extract the acceleration signals in time domain and frequency domain of the upper and lower parts of the mounts. The data is analyzed and the vibration transmissibility is calculated using the corresponding root-mean-square values of acceleration. The results showed that the design process of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> could well improve the vibration isolation performance.|$|R
