5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> in the Land of Grapico. <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. An examination {{of some of the}} lyrics from bands such as these show a lack of any explicitly negative themes. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] could just as well be a conversation between husband and wife, as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; <b>Meet</b> <b>me</b> {{in the middle of the}} air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

[...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you <b>meet</b> <b>me,</b> in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Johansson practiced acting by {{staring in}} the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> in St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her {{brothers}} instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: [...] "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." [...] She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, {{in which she had}} only two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She remembers being on the set of the film, knowing instinctively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).|$|E

500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster...

[...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction.

500|$|Jesse Eisenberg's {{breakthrough}} {{starring role}} was in Zombieland. The horror-comedy, which saw him with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a sleeper hit. In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg {{in the film}} The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role {{as soon as they}} watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition. On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year. On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared. Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was [...] "an overwhelming experience," [...] and was happy that [...] "we were both able to have fun at the situation." [...] Zuckerberg, who has been a vocal disser on the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg [...] "was a little afraid to <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds. The song, written solely by Swift, is in the key of D minor with Swift's vocals {{spanning}} two octaves, from F3 to C5. Johnathan Keefe claimed that [...] "the a capella [...] "Drop everything now" [...] exclamation simply commands attention, with the desperation in Swift’s call-to-action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste." [...] Bobby Peacock stated that [...] "I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is [...] hardly make-or-break. Perhaps my biggest {{problem is that the}} song's chorus undermines itself in the second half – it starts out emphatic [...] and anthemic as usual, but there's just no [...] "oomph" [...] on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated [...] ""Sparks Fly" [...] centers around a simple but effective hook—"I see sparks fly whenever you smile"—that further cements Swift’s reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, [...] "Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a [...] "bad idea," [...] she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: [...] "Drop everything now, <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / ‘Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile," [...] she sings insistently." ...|$|E
