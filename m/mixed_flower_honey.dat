For samples of honey sensory analysis evaluated the color, appearance, consistency, smell and taste. Sensory evaluation of honey was held from 25. 9. 2015 to 27. 9. 2015 in the premises of leisure centers in Lužánecký park.

The findings were evaluated by using Honey Standard presented in the Turkish Honey Regulation (Turkish Food Codex, Honey Directive) All the samples collected from local retailers in Ankara were analysed for their humidity, acidity, diastase activity, hydroxymethyl furfural, invert sugar, sucrose, commercial glucose, ash, starch and pollen contents. 80 % of floral honey and 31. 43 % of pine honey samples were laid down by the Turkish standard. According to the pollen analyse results 5. 71 % of floral honey samples included rhododendron pollens.
