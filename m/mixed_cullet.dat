40|$|EN] Methods for {{recycling}} <b>mixed</b> <b>cullet,</b> {{which is a}} constituent of solid common wastes, are analyzed. It is shown {{that the problem of}} recycling wastes of this form remains topical. It is established experimentally that the method of mechanochemical activation makes it possible to obtain a mixed alkaline binding substance which is promising for the production of unfired heat-insulating materials with high mechanical properties.

40|$|Formulated Lime mortars {{suitable}} for long-term storage in silos or bags {{can be produced}} by adding quicklime to wet, as-received quarried sand. However, sands with high water content may require the addition of so much quicklime that would alter the mortar proportioning. This work investigates the possibility to replace part of the lime-dried sand with dry crushed <b>mixed</b> glass <b>cullet</b> and calcium carbonate aggregate to allow greater control over mortar formulations. It is shown {{that the use of}} glass yields a similar or slightly weaker product, depending upon curing regime, than the control whilst calcium carbonate generates the strongest mortar...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} types of paper mill sludge were first of all incinerated and then attrition milled separately or <b>mixed</b> with glass <b>cullet</b> in varying proportions to obtain powders of different compositions. These powders were then dried, sieved, uniaxially pressed into samples and air sintered. Fired samples were characterized by density, water absorption, shrinkage on firing, strength, hardness and fracture toughness measurements; SEM and X-ray diffractions were also carried out to investigate microstructure and phase composition. Some sintered samples displayed fairly good physical and mechanical properties {{as a consequence of}} their low residual porosity and fine microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom {{collects}} more {{container glass}} through its recycling program {{than can be}} returned to closed-loop recycling. This imbalance is particularly acute for pubglass (wine and beer bottles). Commingled glass (mixed clear, green and brown container glass) needs sorting by colour, and this limits its applicability. There {{is a need to}} find secondary uses for commingled waste glass on a large scale. A novel material, TinGlass Concrete (TGC), is proposed for partial replacement of concrete by waste glass cullet of any colour, impurity and granules’ size, by using the concept of Tin Glass Construction Unit (TGCU). The TGCU is an innovative product patented at the University of Brighton comprising <b>mixed</b> glass <b>cullet</b> fused in a tin-plated steel can. The steel can forms a permanent fused-on mould; it can be sourced from waste stream. It is proposed to use TGCUs in precast concrete by embedding them into concrete elements, cubes and beams, during casting. To establish how well TGC could reproduce properties of conventional concrete, a series of tests in compression and flexure have been performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of porous foaming materials by <b>mixing</b> together glass <b>cullet</b> and iron powder {{is a useful}} method of reusing industrial waste from the process of ship-breaking. In this study, we try to produce the foaming materials with magnetism to use the materials for purifying water. The cullet added foaming agent and iron powder were mixing and granulating. Then, these granulating batches were heated at 700 - 850 ℃ for 3 h. It is found that obtained formed materials from cullet with iron powder have light-weight and porous structure, respectively bulk density 0. 6 - 1. 5 g/cm 3. In addition, {{it is observed that}} these formed-granulating showed the property of phosphate absorption...|$|R
40|$|Municipal and {{industrial}} wastes were <b>mixed</b> with glass <b>cullet</b> producing successfully bulk glasses and glass fibres. Depending on {{the composition and}} amount of the waste, glasses with different characteristics were obtained. Some of the glasses were also crystallised to produce glass ceramics. Glass cullet was foamed {{with the use of}} suitable foaming agents. The properties of the foams obtained were comparable to those of currently manufactured material. Leaching and durability tests showed that micropollutants are retained in the waste-derived glass, so the material can either be disposed safely or used as raw material to produce other items. This work thus demonstrates that wastes can be inertized by mixing them with glass formers, and that they can also be valorised if the produced glass is used to manufacture commercial products...|$|R
40|$|Vitrification by melting {{is being}} {{proposed}} as a convenient method to solidify {{different kind of}} silicate and other oxide-based inorganic wastes. Incinerator bottom and fly ashes have been <b>mixed</b> with glass <b>cullet,</b> feldspar and clay by-products as melting fluxing agents. Washing, drying and grinding pre-treatment followed by melting at 1450 °C lead {{to the formation of}} glasses and glass-ceramics, depending on the starting materials composition and thermal treatment. The obtained glasses have been studied by SEM, chemical durability tests in aqueous and alkaline environment, leaching test (UNI 10802) and by differential thermal analysis. The glass-ceramics morphology was investigated by XRD and SEM. The results were explained by the structure of the glasses caused by the presence of different amount of modifiers in the glassy lattice. The obtained glasses show good chemical resistance, in particular in alkaline environment and thermal characterisation highlighted that the materials are also suitable to obtain glass-ceramics...|$|R
40|$|The {{vitrification}} of an hazardous iron-rich waste (W), {{arising from}} slag flotation of copper production, was studied. Two glasses, containing 30 wt % W were melted for 30 min at 1400 ◦ C. The first batch, labeled WSZ, {{was obtained by}} mixing W, blast furnace slag (S) and zeolite tuff (Z), whereas the second, labeled WG, was prepared by <b>mixing</b> W, glass <b>cullet</b> (G), sand and limestone. The glass frits showed high chemical durability, measured by the TCLP test. The crystallization of the glasses was evaluated by DTA. The crystal phases formed were identified by XRD resulting to be pyroxene and wollastonite solid solutions, magnetite and hematite. The morphology of the glass–ceramics was observed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. WSZ composition showed {{a high rate of}} bulk crystallization and resulted to be suitable for producing glass–ceramics by a short crystallization heat-treatment. WG composition showed a low crystallization rate and good sinterability; glass–ceramics were obtained by sintercrystallization of the glass frit...|$|R
40|$|In theory, glass {{diverted}} or {{recovered from}} the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream {{can be used as}} feedstock (glass cullet) in the production of new glass containers. However, post-consumer glass typically contains a mixture of clear and coloured material and is often contaminated with other wastes; characteristics that are impediments to the production of new containers. Sorting and cleaning of glass diverted from MSW to make it feasible for use in bottle industries are also time consuming and costly tasks. There is, however, the potential to use recycled glass as a sub-base material for road pavement construction. Geotechnical investigations to date suggest that use of recycled glass as a roadway sub-base could be cost-effective, and thus preclude the need for expensive sorting. There is, however, the necessessity to further investigate the potential short- and long-term toxicity, health hazards, and/or environmental pollution associated with use of <b>mixed</b> glass <b>cullet</b> as an aggregate, considering conditions during stockpiled storage and after placement. The results of laboratory tests on recycled glass regarding its potential to release pollutants to the environment via leaching are presented herein. Five random samples of crushed glasses were collected from a recycling company in Melbourne, Australia. The parameters tested for each sample were total organic matter, heavy metals, sulfates, chlorides, conductivity, pH and surfactant levels. It wais found that in most cases, the contamination levels were within the State of Victoria's Environmental Protection Agency-specified limits for manual handling, thus indicating that recycled glass could probably be safely used in pavement sub-bases...|$|R
40|$|Alumino{{silicate}} and silicate glass-ceramics {{were obtained}} from controlled devitrification of CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 glassy systems starting from Spanish and Italian coal fly ash or Italian municipal incinerator slag mixed with other byproducts, such as glass cullet and dolomite, The nucleation mechanism and the crystallization kinetics were investigated by thermal, diffractometric, and microstructural measurements. Moreover, the experimentally observed devitrification and {{the identification of the}} crystalline phases formed were compared with the indications derived from Ginsberg, Raschin-Tschetveritkov, and Lebedeva diagrams used for petrological glass-ceramics. All the glasses showed a good crystallization tendency with the formation of dendritic pyroxene and acicular wollastonite together with feldspar and iron spinels starting from the surface. The activation energy values for crystallization ranging from 472 to 832 kJ. mol(- 1) were found to be close to those typical for aluminosilicate glasses; moreover, the possibility to vitrify and devitrify up to 100 wt% of slag and up to 40 - 50 wt% of ash <b>mixed</b> with glass <b>cullet</b> and dolomite makes the vitrification treatment a suitable disposal procedure...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur {{polymer cement}} (SPC) is being {{considered}} as a matrix encapsulant for the Hanford low-level (activity) waste glass. SPC is an elemental sulfur polymer-stabilized thermoplastic that is fluid at 120 {degrees}C to 140 {degrees}C. The candidate process would encapsulate the waste glass by <b>mixing</b> the glass <b>cullet</b> with the SPC and casting it into the container. As the primary barrier to groundwater and {{a key factor in}} controlling the local environment of the disposal system after it has been compromised, SPC {{plays a key role in}} the waste form`s long-term performance assessment. Work in fiscal year 1995 targeted several technical areas of matrix encapsulation involving SPC. A literature review was performed to evaluate potential matrix-encapsulant materials. The dissolution and corrosion behavior of SPC under static conditions was determined as a function of temperature, pH, and sample surface area/solution volume. Preliminary dynamic flow-through testing was performed. SPC formulation and properties were investigated, including controlled crystallization, phase formation, modifying polymer effects on crystallization, and SPC processibility. The interface between SPC and simulated LLW glass was examined. Interfacial chemistry and stability, the effect of water on the glass/SPC interface, and the effect of molten sulfur on the glass surface chemistry were established. Preliminary scoping experiments, involving SPC`s Tc gettering capabilities were performed. Compressive strengths of SPC and SPC/glass composites, both before and after lifetime radiation dose exposure, were determined...|$|R
30|$|The earlier {{colourless}} glasses from Vergina, Pydna and Gordion (mid 4 th–early 2 nd century BCE) were decoloured with antimony, {{which is}} at variance with the manganese decolourant process practiced {{in the production of}} later colourless glass from Tel Anafa, and for most colourless glass from Jebel Khalid (mid 2 nd–early 1 st century BCE). Pherai and the Rhodes Bead Factory group, slightly earlier than and contemporary with Tel Anafa and Jebel Khalid, have samples fully decoloured with antimony. From the Rhodes Necropolis bowls group there is only one sample decoloured with antimony, while another two contained both decolourants (i.e., antimony and manganese). There are samples from the Rhodes Bead Factory and one from Pherai that contain both antimony and manganese, seen also in four glasses from Jebel Khalid. If the elevated concentrations of both antimony and manganese in colourless samples JK 13 and JK 52, and in imperfectly decoloured samples JK 20 and JK 35, were intentional, this might suggest several scenarios. (1) It is possible that both decolourants were added to achieve colourless glass. (2) The cullet used to make the vessels was acquired from two different traditions, from more than one source, and was mixed together (for examples of ancient Hellenistic cullet see [8 : p. 51, 10, 49]), possibly as a result of recycling [10 : p. 284, 15 : pp. 95 – 96, 28 : pp. 771 – 772]. The presence of lead suggested recycling in other Pherai glasses ([15 : p. 94]; see also [27]). (3) The inclusion of antimony could also have been intended for the purpose of fining of the glass melt. Jackson [28 : p. 705] noted that antimony is usually found only as a trace in glassmaking raw materials, so to be at detectable levels it must have been intentionally or coincidentally added, perhaps due to the <b>mixing</b> of different <b>cullet</b> from two different colourant traditions, either as a result of recycling, or of the mixing of raw glass from two different contemporary primary production centres.|$|R
