40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of a mechanics based soil-roller interaction model intended to determine the degree of compaction of the top soil layer. The model was calibrated with, and compared to, soils data obtained from field and laboratory tests. The model contained 2 soil layers, but can be expanded to include additional layers. This study concludes that the developed soil-roller interaction model is capable of accurately determining the degree of compaction of the upper soil layer through back calculation of the soil modulus values. The model was able to reach convergence between the calculated and <b>measured</b> values of <b>roller</b> drum deflection through a regression analysis of soil stiffness and damping characteristics. The final values of the stiffness and damping characteristics needed to achieve a 1 percent difference between the calculated and <b>measured</b> values of <b>roller</b> drum deflection fell within expected ranges for the type of material tested. Part of this study included a sensitivity analysis of the input characteristics. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the output of the model was highly sensitive to the mass of the second soil layer and to the elastic and plastic stiffness characteristics within both soil layers, but relatively insensitive to the mass of the first soil layer. The lack of sensitivity to the mass of the first soil layer means that large changes in the layer mass, and by extension the density, will have little effect on the output of the model. This characteristic is a drawback for conventional, density based specifications. However, specifications based on installing fill to the designed values of stiffness or modulus could benefit from the model. Much of the initial difference between calculated and <b>measured</b> <b>roller</b> drum deflection was probably caused by the difficulty in determining accurate starting values for the soil stiffness, damping and mass model characteristics. Future research should focus on ways to determine accurate values of the required input characteristics...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} <b>measure</b> of <b>roller</b> chain's {{strength}} is tensile strength. Tensile strength represents how much load a chain can withstand under a one-time load before breaking. Just {{as important as}} tensile strength is a chain's fatigue strength. The critical factors in a chain's fatigue strength {{is the quality of}} steel used to manufacture the chain, the heat treatment of the chain components, the quality of the pitch hole fabrication of the linkplates, and the type of shot plus the intensity of shot peen coverage on the linkplates. Other factors can include the thickness of the linkplates and the design (contour) of the linkplates. The rule of thumb for roller chain operating on a continuous drive is for the chain load to not exceed a mere 1/6 or 1/9 of the chain's tensile strength, {{depending on the type of}} master links used (press-fit vs. slip-fit). Roller chains operating on a continuous drive beyond these thresholds can and typically do fail prematurely via linkplate fatigue failure.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to monitor the wheel-rail friction coefficient in railway vehicles to improve their traction and braking performance {{as well as to}} reduce the number of incidents caused by low friction. Model based fault detection and identification (FDI) methods, especially state observers have been commonly used in previous research to monitor the wheel-rail friction. However, the previous methods cannot provide an accurate value of the friction coefficient and few of them have been validated using experiments. A Kalman filter based estimator is proposed in this research project. The developed estimator uses signals from the traction motor and provides a new and more efficient approach to monitoring the condition of the wheel-rail contact condition. A 1 / 5 scaled test rig has been built to evaluate the developed method. This rig comprises 2 axle-hung induction motors driving both the wheelsets of the bogie through 2 pairs of spur gears. 2 DC generators are used to provide traction load to the rollers through timing pulleys. The motors are independently controlled by 2 inverters. Motor parameters such as voltage, current and speed are measured by the inverters. The speed of the wheel and roller and the output of the DC generator are measured by incremental encoders and Hall-effect current clamps. A LabVIEW code has been designed to process all the collected data and send control commands to the inverters. The communication between the PC and the inverters are realized using the Profibus (Process Field Bus) and the OPC (Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control) protocol. 3 different estimators were first developed using computer simulations. Kalman filter and its two nonlinear developments: extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) have been used in these 3 methods. The results show that the UKF based estimator can provide the best performance in this case. The requirement for <b>measuring</b> the <b>roller</b> speed and the traction load are also studied using the UKF. The results show that it is essential to <b>measure</b> the <b>roller</b> speed but the absence of the traction load measurement does not have significant impact on the estimation accuracy. A re-adhesion control algorithm, which reduces excessive creepage between the wheel and rail, is developed based on the UKF estimator. Accurate monitoring of the friction coefficient helps the traction motor work at its optimum point. As the largest creep force is generated, the braking and accelerating time and distance can be reduced to their minimum values. This controller can also avoid excessive creepage and hence potentially reduce the wear of the wheel and rail. The UKF based estimator development has been evaluated by experiments conducted on the roller rig. Three different friction conditions were tested: base condition without contamination, water contamination and oil contamination. The traction load was varied to cover a large range of creepage. The importance of <b>measuring</b> the <b>roller</b> speed and the traction load was also studied. The UKF based estimator was shown to provide reliable estimation in most of the tested conditions. The experiments also confirm that it is not necessary to measure the traction load and give good agreement with the simulation results.

40|$|Meehan, ChristopherThe {{objective}} of the study presented in this thesis is to investigate the use of continuous compaction control (CCC) systems within an earthwork compaction specification framework. For this purpose, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) funded a field study to construct a small-scale soil embankment, utilizing CCC technology simultaneously with conventional in situ compaction verification test methods during the construction process. The material {{that was used to}} build the embankment classified as poorly-graded sand with silt. The CCC <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> machine drive power (MDP) values, compaction meter values (CMV), and corresponding global positioning system (GPS) location values. For conventional in situ compaction verification, numerous density-based quality assurance test methods (e. g., Nuclear Density Gauge and Sand Cone) and modulus-based test methods (e. g., Lightweight Deflectometer and GeoGauge) were performed. A holistic analysis of the data collected from the field study was performed to assess the use of CCC systems in an earthwork compaction specification framework. The first goal {{of this study was to}} examine the possibility of using data recorded by CCC systems to monitor and control the thickness of compacted soil lifts during earthwork operations. During the field study, the compaction roller utilized a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) to determine the three dimensional location of the compactor in real-time. Data collected from the field study was then used to demonstrate how GPS measurements recorded by CCC equipment could be used for field monitoring of lift thickness. The use of simple and sophisticated geospatial interpolation techniques were examined for interpolating measured field elevation data onto a uniform grid for lift thickness evaluation. The approach that is presented can be used to build spatial maps of compacted soil lift thickness, which are a useful decision-making tool for field inspectors. The second goal of this study was to perform statistical regression analyses to compare the results of the in situ spot testing methods with the two CCC measurements (MDP and CMV) that were recorded during the compaction process. In order to accurately compare the in situ spot testing measurements and CCC measurements, Nearest Neighbor, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Ordinary Kriging interpolation techniques were utilized to predict CCC measurements at the corresponding in situ spot test locations. In general, regression analyses performed using the CCC predictions from the Ordinary Kriging method showed slightly higher correlations, however, the difference did not appear significant enough to outweigh the complex nature of this geospatial interpolation technique. Univariate regression analysis was performed first for point-by-point comparisons of the data and then on a data set which comprised of average values for each lift and pass. The point-by-point comparisons yielded weak correlations, while the comparison of the average value data sets showed much stronger correlations; this finding agrees well with observations that have been reported by other researchers. As other researchers have also reported that moisture content can drastically affect the compaction process and resulting density of soil, additional analyses using a multivariate regression technique were performed, which introduced the use of in situ measured moisture content as an independent variable. The results from these regression correlations showed generally much stronger correlation between the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements for both the point-by-point and average data sets. This observation provided confirmation of the influence of moisture content on the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements. The final goal of the study was to evaluate the use of CCC technology within an earthwork compaction specification framework. To accomplish this goal, implementation of existing CCC compaction verification acceptance criteria using the data collected from the aforementioned field study was performed. The acceptance criteria that were assessed include: spot testing of <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> weakest areas, limiting percentage change in <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> values, and comparison of <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> values to in situ measured values. Each of the three acceptance criteria show potential for implementation into an earthwork specification; however, since the spot testing of <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> weakest areas method still utilizes conventional in situ methods, it shows the most promise for immediate adoption and transition into CCC technology.

In this paper, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method for the machine fault diagnosis is proposed.

The different failure characteristic frequencies can be distinguished in the component of different orders of IMF, and the time and frequency of failure characteristic frequency appearance can be clearly reflected in the Hilbert spectrum...|$|R

We therefore tested {{the hypothesis that}} when using TAP catheters, providing local anesthetic in repeated bolus doses increases the cephalad-caudad cutaneous effects compared with a basal-only infusion. Bilateral TAP catheters (posterior approach) were inserted in 24 healthy volunteers followed by ropivacaine 2 mg/mL administration {{for a total of}} 6 hours. The right side was randomly assigned to either a basal infusion (8 mL/h) or bolus doses (24 mL administered every 3 hours for a total of 2 bolus doses) in a double-masked manner. The left side received the alternate treatment. The primary end point was the extent of sensory deficit as <b>measured</b> by cool <b>roller</b> along the axillary line at hour 6 (6 hours after the local anesthetic administration was initiated). Secondary end points included the extent of sensory deficit as <b>measured</b> by cool <b>roller</b> and Von Frey filaments along the axillary line and along a transverse line {{at the level of the}} anterior superior iliac spine at hours 0 to 6. Although there were statistically significant differences between treatments within the earlier part of the administration period, by hour 6 the difference in extent of sensory deficit to cold failed to reach statistical significance along the axillary line (mean = 0. 9 cm; SD = 6. 8; 95 % confidence interval - 2. 0 to 3. 8; P =. 515) and transverse line (mean = 2. 5 cm; SD = 10. 1; 95 % confidence interval - 1. 8 to 6. 8; P =. 244). Although the difference between treatments was statistically significant at various early time points for the horizontal, vertical, and estimated area measurements of both cold and mechanical pressure sensory deficits, no comparison remained statistically significant by hour 6. No evidence was found in this study involving healthy volunteers to support the hypothesis that changing the local anesthetic administration technique (continuous basal versus hourly bolus) when using ropivacaine 0. 2 % and TAP catheters at 8 mL/h and 24 mL every 3 hours significantly influences the cutaneous effects after 6 hours of administration.

40|$|Machining is {{the most}} {{important}} part of the manufacturing processes. Machining deals with the process of removing materialfrom a work piece in the form of chips. Machining is necessary where tight tolerances on dimensions and finishes arerequired. The common feature is the use of a cutting tool to form a chip that is removed from the work part, called Swarf. Every tool is subjected to wear in machining. The wear of the tool is gradual and reaches certain limit of life which is identifiedwhen the tool no longer produce the parts to required quality. There are various types of wear a single point cuttingtool may be subjected to in turning. Of these, flank wear on the tool significantly affects surface roughness. The other typesof tool wears are generally avoided by proper selection of tool material and cutting conditions. On-line surface roughnessmeasurements gained significant importance in manufacturing systems to provide accurate machining. The Acoustic Emission(AE) analysis is one of the most promising techniques for on-line surface roughness monitoring. The AE signals arevery sensitive to changes in cutting process conditions. The gradual flank wear of the tool in turning causes changes in AEsignal parameters. In the present work investigations are carried for turning operation on mild steel material using HSS tool. The AE signals are measured by highly sensitive piezoelectric element; the on-line signals are suitably amplified using ahigh gain pre-amplifier.

This paper deals with a decomposition of the low frequency structure-borne noise transmission paths at the wheel center in order to assess tire/wheel and vehicle effects.

This decomposition involves blocked forces and vibroacoustic frequency response functions, both requiring specific setups to be <b>measured</b> on a <b>roller</b> bench. As road noise is a random process, a principal component analysis has to be performed on tire/wheel blocked forces to properly handle dynamic excitations. Since the interface between wheel and suspension is rather stiff, the quality of tire/wheel blocked forces measurement strongly rely on bench test characteristics. In addition, comparisons between results coming from tire and car manufacturers may be distorted due to differences of road surfaces of rollers. Another difficulty is related to rotating effects that cant be neglected and which can alter the quality of the road noise recomposition.

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of printing or coating processes for paper products the velocity of the web and the roller width can be increased. However, these measures cause deformations of the rollers, heating effects and streak print defects due to undesirable oscillations. The vibration characteristic is significant for the quality and efficiency of the printing or coating processes. Approved methods like balancing of the rollers and maximizing the bending stiffness have come to technical limits. This paper describes a new promising technology for further optimization of printing and coating machines. Piezoelectric actuators are integrated in the bearings of a roller of a flexographic printing machine and generate counterforces to compensate undesired bending vibrations. Strain gauges applied on the <b>roller</b> <b>measure</b> the vibrations. A simulation model of the mechatronic overall-system has been developed to design the control strategy. The oscillations of roller systems in printing machines and other industrial applications are mainly stimulated by disturbances that occur periodically with each rotation.

Due {{to the fact that}} the excitations of the oscillations are periodically with the rotation of rollers, another approach for vibration reduction has been developed.

40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the crowned rollers. The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended.

40|$|Compound faults {{often occur}} in {{rotating}} machinery, {{which increases the}} difficulty of fault diagnosis. In this case, blind source separation, which usually includes independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse component analysis (SCA), was proposed to separate mixed signals. SCA, {{which is based on}} the sparsity of target signals, was developed to sever the compound faults and effectively diagnose the fault due to its advantage over ICA in underdetermined conditions. However, there is an issue regarding the vibration signals, which are inadequately sparse, {{and it is difficult to}} represent them in a sparse way. Accordingly, to overcome the above-mentioned problem, a sparsity-promoted approach named wavelet modulus maxima is applied to obtain the sparse observation signal. Then, the potential function is utilized to estimate the number of source signals and the mixed matrix based on the sparse signal. Finally, the separation of the source signals can be achieved according to the shortest path method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulated signals and vibration signals <b>measured</b> from faulty <b>roller</b> bearings are used. The faults that occur in a roller bearing are the outer-race flaw, the inner-race flaw and the rolling element flaw. The results show that the fault features acquired using the proposed approach are evidently close to the theoretical values. For instance, the inner-race feature frequency 101. 3 Hz is very similar to the theoretical calculation 101 Hz. Therefore, it is effective to achieve the separation of compound faults utilizing the suggest method, even in underdetermined cases. In addition, a comparison is applied to prove that the proposed method outperforms the traditional SCA method when the vibration signals are inadequate...|$|R

The main aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how fibres affect the structural behaviour such as the possibility for redistribution, crack patterns and load-carrying capacity. The investigation was conducted by means of experiments on two-way octagonal slabs, simply supported on four edges, centrically loaded with a point load. The slabs spanned 2. 2 m in both directions and the reinforcement amount was twice as large in one direction as in the other, in order to provoke uneven load distribution. Three slabs of each reinforcement configuration were produced and tested: conventionally reinforced slabs, steel fibre reinforced slabs and a combination of both reinforcement types. The reaction force on each supported edge was <b>measured</b> on five <b>rollers</b> per edge. A moderate fibre content (35 kg/m 3) of double hook-end steel fibres was used. The steel fibres affected the structural behaviour significantly by providing post-cracking ductility and by increasing the ultimate load-carrying capacity by approximately 20 %. Most significant, the steel fibres influenced the load redistribution in such a way that more load could be transferred to supports in the weaker direction after cracking. Further, more evenly distributed support reactions were obtained in the slabs containing both reinforcement types compared to the case when only conventional reinforcement was used. The slabs reinforced by steel fibres alone did not experience any bending hardening; however, a considerable post-cracking ductility was observed. Furthermore, the work presented in this paper will provide results suitable for use in benchmarking numerical and analytical modelling methods for steel fibre reinforced concrete, as the experimental programme also included extensive testing of material properties...|$|R

If there are n rows in total, the first n/ 2 rows contain X coordinates, the second half are Y coordinates. Each row corresponds to one profile. You will need to process these into R-Z coordinates using the scanParams. txt files. scanAngles. txt Contains the angle (in rotations of spindle) at which the measurements in X are taken. Element i contains the angle at which the profile on row I and i+n/ 2 are measured in scanShapes. txt scanParams. txt Contain the laser calibration data {{at the time the}} scan is taken in the following order: 1. Rotation of the data (rotate measured X-Y data by this to get to Z-R coordinates). 2. Axial displacement (add this to Z coordinates) 3. Radial displacement (add this to R coordinates) 4. Axial scale (multiple axial coordinates by this 5. Radial scale (multiply radial coordinates by this) Shape 3 D_X. txt is the same format as scanShapes. txt but taken mid process. X gives the ID of the measurement, which can be used to correspond to the online wrinkle measurement ID in column 18 of forcePosLog. txt Shape. txt contains a log of the shape, taken more frequently than shape 3 D_X. txt files, but only the mean profile. It also contains the tool positions etc. at the time the shape measurement is taken. It contains groups of three rows, the first of which contains data in the same form as each row of forcePosLog. txt. The second row contains the Z coordinates and the third contains R coordinates along the profile (they are already rotated, so no need to worry about laser parameters). Thickness. txt contains the thickness measurements. The top row of this file should be headers: Point, Parallel and Perpendicular. The next row contains the data: - 1, the value the dial guage read with no sheet in between (i. e. the zero value), the distance between measurement points. The subsequent rows contain the data: measurement point number, thickness when measuring along direction parallel to rolling direction, same in perpendicular direction. The measurement point number is 0 at the very centre, and is a distance s from the centre, where s is given by measurement point number x distance between measurement points.

40|$|A {{pavement}} construction {{designed to}} cope with the different type of traffic loads; it is exposed to {{and at the same time}} it can resist the effect of the climate. A road structure consists of sub- and superstructure which is divided by a boundary known as terrace. During the construction of unbound layers (base course and sub-base course) in the superstructure, it is always ensured that the material meet the requirements for bearing capacity and the degree of compaction. These parameters are controlled by various laboratory tests and control methods. To obtain increased knowledge of the material and improve the quality of the compaction in the field, it is necessary to perform laboratory tests in order to determine material properties. A base course material 0 / 32 mm limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) was investigated in this study. To determine properties of the material various laboratory tests such as proctor compaction test, Micro-Deval, Los Angeles, and grain distribution curve are conducted. To investigate how grain size distribution affects technical properties of the material, the 0 / 32 mm material was modified with two different samples; grain size distribution of 2 / 32 mm excluding superior material content, and 0 +/ 32 mm with enhanced superior material content. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in material behavior during proctor compaction. Two aspects of changes in material behavior were emphasized in this study; the optimal water content and maximum dry density, as well as changes of both. As a reference for the limestone features, a traditional 0 / 32 mm tonalite material (granite) from Vällstaverket was used relating to proctor investigation. Material's resistance to abrasion and fragmentation was investigated by two methods: Micro-Deval and Los Angeles. The results were compared with other rock materials. Furthermore the bearing capacity of the material was verified by examination of the Young's modulus and degree of compaction, as well as properties of water content and dry density, at three trial areas on Gotland. This is performed with various methods such as static plate loading test, light weight deflectometer, density gauge/SDG 200, and water/sand volume meter measurement test. By comparing results from different methods of measurement, it may indicate a relationship between these. Test area 3 consists of two smaller test areas which have different water content. The bearing capacity (Young's modulus) and the degree of compaction were <b>measured</b> after each <b>roller</b> passage. Different relationships were obtained between the amount of roller overpass, with Young's modulus of material; as well as degree of compaction. It was found in this study that limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) maintain its position as construction material for the unbound layers of the road. The result from static plate load which indicated high E V 2 values (Young's modulus) was obtained from the field, and it suggests that a fine bearing capacity can be achieved in the use of limestone...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{occurs when}} soil particles are pressed together, thus reducing pore spaces between them. Compaction {{is caused by}} the use of heavy machinery, pressure from wheels, tillage equipment, trampling by animals reduced use of organic matter, frequent use of chemical fertilizers and ploughing at the same depth for many years. The signs of soil: Slow plant emergence, thin stands, uneven early growth, small grain heads, abnormal rooting patterns and reduced nutrients offtake can be a reflection of compation. Excessive soil compaction impedes root growth and therefore limits the amount of soil explored by roots. Soil compaction is a problem of global concern and very few have worked on this issue in Pakistan. Therefore this research work was conducted to investigate and document the deleterious effects of subsurface soil compaction on crop and soil properties, as well as to evaluate best and cheap improvement measures for reducing subsurface soil compaction Two field experiments were conducted during the year 2002 - 03 and repeated during the year 2003 - 04 at the Agriculture Research Station, Mingora, Pakistan. In first experiment the effects of subsurface soil compaction were studied. In second experiment the effects of improvement measures applied to the artificially compated subsurface soil were investigated. In first experiment, the 0. 1 m surface horizon was removed from all the plots with the help of scraper. The subsurface was compated using 7. 0 tons roller. The number of passes of <b>roller</b> <b>measured</b> the level of compation. The experiment consisted of four treatments. The subsurface soil was compacted with two passes of roller in T 1, four passes of roller in T 2 and six passes of roller in T 3, while no compaction was applied to T 4 (control). The topsoil was evenly applied to the whole plot and wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was grown. In second experiment, the 0. 1 meter surface soil was removed with a scrper. Different improvement measures were applied to subplots according to sowing plan. The experiment consisted of five treatments. T 1 received deep ploughing (D. P), T 2 received D. P+FYM at 14000 kg/ja, T 3 received D. P+Gypsum at 4000 kg/ha, T 4 received D. P +FYM+Gypsum at the rates mentioned above while T 5 (control) no addition of improvement measure was made. The subsurface of the whole plot was then compacted with 4 passes of a 7. 0 tons roller. The 0. 1 m surface soil was uniformly distributed in the plot with blade mounted tractor and scraper. Lay out was again carried out and deep ploughing was given to all the sub plots with chisel plough to a depth of 20 cm except control. Wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was frown in all the plots with a seeding rate of 140 kg/ha- 1 In first experiment compaction of the subsurface significantly affected days to anthesis, days to maturity, plant height spikes m- 2, grains per spike, thousand grain weight, biological yield, grain yield, harvest index, crop growth rate (CGR), root length, subsurface soil bulk density, subsurface soil porosity, percent grain protein, N concentration in plants (...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical and experimental investigation performed on a barrel of a speargun equipped with two kinds of muzzle. In particular, a standard muzzle for speargun (having an elastic propulsion) has been compared with an innovative one called ‘roller’. This new muzzle is equipped with two rollers and special bands. The rubber bands, fixed at the lower side of the barrel, run through the rollers and are engaged in suitable seats of the shaft. These bands are, therefore, longer than the traditional ones and, consequently, with equal force applied by the diver, the roller speargun has a longer range. Thanks to the particular geometry of the new muzzle, one of the front constraints of the elastic bands is moved to {{the lower part of the}} barrel or the handle. As a consequence, the scheme of the loads applied on the speargun remarkably changes passing from a standard muzzle to a roller one. All that has a great influence on the level of deformation of the barrel and, consequently, on the accuracy of the shot. Because of the low velocity of the spear (if compared with the firearms), in fact, the accuracy of the shoot if strongly influenced by the barrel bending due to the forces applied by means of the elastic bands. In this paper it is experimentally evaluated the bending of the barrel equipped both with the innovative muzzle and with the traditional one in order to compare their performances. The experimental analysis of the barrel was performed by electrical strain gauges suitably located at the section with the highest values of the strains. In order to find the barrel section with the highest strain values where to locate the strain gauges, a preliminary numerical FEM analysis has been performed. The loads and constraints scheme has been evaluated both for the standard and the new muzzle. In particular, the forces due to the elastic bands, their application points and directions have been experimentally obtained. To speed up the process of numerical simulation, without invalidating the results reliability, simplified FEM models have been used. In particular, a very accurate model of the barrel has been shaped, whereas the models of the muzzles and the handle have been simplified. The forces due to the elastic bands, experimentally obtained, have been applied on the FEM models. The maps of the maximum and minimum principal strains have allowed to find the area with the highest strain values, placed in rear part of the barrel (near the handle). The strain values experimentally measured on the speargun have been very similar to the ones calculated by means of the numerical simulations. That demonstrates the developed FEM models are very reliable and can ben used to predict the performances of the speragun under different loads conditions. The speargun with the new roller muzzle shows very lower strain values if compared with the ones measured in the standard one. Nevertheless, considering the two spearguns have different elastic bands setup, it has been thought the comparison of their performances should be made hypothesizing the same maximum force applied during the speargun charge. This condition, moreover, could be really obtained by changing the kind of the elastic bands in the speargun with the roller muzzle. For this reason, during the results analysis phase, the strain values <b>measured</b> on the <b>roller</b> speargun have been ‘normalized’ by increasing them of a value equal to the ratio of the maximum forces due to the rubber bands. The data post processing has allowed to evaluate the forces and the bending moments on the barrels with the standard muzzle and the roller one. Results show the barrel with the innovative muzzle has, also considering equal forces applied by the diver, a lower bending than the barrel with a traditional muzzle. To evaluate the maximum deflection of both the spearguns, a new numerical simulation has been set up. In particular, in this FEM analysis, the roller speargung has been loaded with a maximum force comparable with the standard one. The obtained results show that the standard speargun has a higher value of the maximum deflection respect to the roller one. Since higher deflection values of the barrel make worse the accuracy of the shot, these results demonstrate the novel speargun can be more precise than the traditional one...|$|R
