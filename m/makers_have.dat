5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper studies a {{decision}} maker who for each choice set selects {{a subset of}} (at most) two alternatives. We axiomatize three types of procedures: (i) The top two: the decision <b>maker</b> <b>has</b> in mind an ordering and chooses the two maximal alternatives. (ii) The two extremes: the decision <b>maker</b> <b>has</b> in mind an ordering and chooses the maximal and the minimal alternatives. (iii) The top and the top: the decision <b>maker</b> <b>has</b> in mind two orderings and he chooses the maximal element from each...|$|R
5000|$|The {{confidence}} {{a decision}} <b>maker</b> <b>has</b> in its choice, {{and related to}} it the commitment a decision <b>maker</b> <b>has</b> to act upon that choice, depends {{on the quality of}} the decision at the time of making the decision. A high-quality decision is characterized by the following elements: ...|$|R

25|$|Several <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> {{produced}} ocarinas with keys, mostly experimentally, {{beginning in}} the late 19th century. Keys and slides either expand the instrument's range, help fingers reach holes that are widely spaced, or play notes not in the native key of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|Comic book {{historians and}} {{industry}} professionals have remarked that Marvel's Star Wars comics {{published in the}} years before The Empire Strikes Back include plot points similar to those later used in the film. However, the film's <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> not acknowledged receiving any inspiration from the comic books.|$|E

25|$|Second {{is the use}} of {{numerical}} tablature, which {{expresses the}} musical notes as numbers. Some <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> developed their own system of numerical tablature for their ocarinas, while others follow a more universal system where numbers correspond to different notes on the scale. This method is typically used by beginners who have not learned to read sheet music.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sporting}} uses {{have been}} for the material's actual qualities. Many ski <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> produced skis wholly from cloth and resin composite materials, using the tailorability of such construction to vary the stiffness, damping and torsional stiffness of a ski along its length. Hexcel, a manufacturer of aluminium honeycomb sheet, became well known for its branded skis, using this same advanced material.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 2007, the International Herald Tribune {{reported}} three Chinese chemical <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> said {{animal feed}} producers often purchase, or seek to purchase, the chemical, cyanuric acid, from their factories to blend into animal feed {{to give the}} false appearance of {{a higher level of}} protein, suggesting another potentially dangerous way that melamine and cyanuric acid might combine in protein products.|$|E

25|$|In general, U.S. and European cycle {{manufacturers}} used {{to assemble}} cycles {{from their own}} frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.|$|E
25|$|Historic Native American flutes are {{generally}} tuned to {{a variation of}} the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound. Recently some <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options. Also, modern flutes {{are generally}} tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) {{so that they can be}} easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} five-string banjo {{is largely}} standardized—but smaller and larger sizes exist, {{including}} the long-neck or Seeger neck variation designed by Pete Seeger. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the banjeaurine, tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, several <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> {{begun to}} market compact B/C trombones that are {{especially}} {{well suited for}} young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B is open when the trigger is not depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on {{the first and second}} positions by using the trigger. A similar design ("Preacher model") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Brazil {{passed an}} affirmative action law {{in an attempt}} to {{directly}} fight the legacy of slavery. Through it Brazilian policy <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> forced state universities, regarded very highly because it is free and of high quality, to have a certain quota of Afro-Brazilians. The percentage of Afro-Brazilians to be admitted, as high as 30% in some states, causes great social discontent that some argue furthers racial tensions. It is argued that these high quotas are needed because of the unequal opportunities available to Afro-Brazilians. In 2012 Brazil’s Supreme Court unanimously held the law constitutional. However, in sectors like education, political representation, and overall quality of life, opportunities and capabilities for Afro-Brazilians will continue to increase. Brazil's government will continue to provide for all of its people as it sees fit, but the issue of slavery and its legacy may forever be felt in all facets of Brazilian life.|$|E

Modern <b>makers</b> <b>have</b> {{increased}} the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds the buzzing bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).|$|E
