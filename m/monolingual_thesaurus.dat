40|$|Thesaurus is an {{important}} tool, which is well suited to find more and/or better terms during writing and reading the documents. Such <b>monolingual</b> <b>thesaurus</b> for Hindi language has been presented in this paper. The use of thesaurus in documents {{is considered to be}} the most important resource to writers. A thesaurus contains synonyms (words which have basically the same meaning) and antonyms, which is important for many other applications in NLP too. This paper describes the script of Hindi language and importance of Hindi thesaurus written in Hindi documents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the motivation for, and methodology behind {{the creation of}} ELSST (European Language Social Science Thesaurus), a broad-based multilingual thesaurus for the social sciences. The thesaurus was produced by the UK Data Archive (UKDA) {{as part of the}} EU-funded LIMBER (Language Independent Metadata Browsing of European Resources) project and was derived from their in-house English <b>monolingual</b> <b>thesaurus,</b> HASSET (Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus). The multilingual thesaurus is currently available in four languages English, French, German and Spanish and in various formats, including RDF (Resource Description Framework). 1...|$|E

Glossaries are useful for both authors and translators Professional authors use a myriad of terminological and stylistic resources in the modern workplace including thesauruses, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, lexical databases, glossaries, terminology databases, author memories, controlled languages, style guides, controlled languages and authoring standards. Thesauruses, dictionaries and encyclopaedias Thesauruses are available in print (for example the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary), as electronic documentation (a. PDF electronic document file for example), online or as thesaurus software. They are often free to use and openly available in the public domain, although some are organisation-specific (World Bank terminology database for example). Thesauruses may be <b>monolingual</b> (<b>Thesaurus.</b> com for example) or multilingual such as the Eurovoc thesaurus (Publications Office of the European Union 2010). Dictionaries too are available in print (th...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that there are}} polysemous words like sentence whose "meaning " or "sense " depends on the context of use. We have recently reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilingual material (the Canadian Hansards) and the other trained on <b>monolingual</b> material (Roget's <b>Thesaurus</b> and Grolier's Encyclopedia). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong discourse effect. That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense. This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis {{and found that the}} tendency to share sense in the same discourse is extremely strong (98 %). This result can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm. In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilingual material (the Canadian Hansards) {{and the other}} trained on <b>monolingual</b> material (Roget's <b>Thesaurus</b> and Grolier's Encyclopedia). After using both the monolingual and bilingual classifiers for a few months, we have convinced ourselves that the performance is remarkably good. Nevertheless, we {{would really like to}} be able to make a stronger statement, and therefore, we decided to try to develop some more objective evaluation measures. Although there has been a fair amount of literature on sense-disambiguation, the literature does not offer much guidance in how we might establish the success or failure of a proposed solution such as the two systems mentioned in the previous paragraph. Many papers avoid quantitative evaluations altogether, because it is so difficult to come up with credible estimates of performance. This paper will attempt to establish upper and lower bounds on the level of performance that can be expected in an evaluation. An estimate of the lower bound of 75 % (averaged over ambiguous types) is obtained by measuring the performance produced by a baseline system that ignores context and simply assigns the most likely sense in all cases. An estimate of the upper bound is obtained by assuming that our ability to measure performance is largely limited by our ability obtain reliable judgments from human informants. Not surprisingly, the upper bound is very dependent on the instructions given to the judges. Jorgensen, for example, suspected that lexicographers tend to depend too much on judgments by a single informant and found considerable variation over judgments (only 68 % agreement), as she had suspected. In our own experiments, we have set out to find word-sense disambiguation tasks where the judges can agree often enough so that we could show that they were outperforming the baseline system. Under quite different conditions, we have found 96. 8 % agreement over judges. 24...|$|R
40|$|The Argentine {{standard}} {{for the construction of}} <b>monolingual</b> <b>thesaurus</b> (IRAM 32057 : 1983) was compared with the last editions of the international standard (ISO 2788 : 1986), and the national standards of Spain (UNE 50106 : 1990), United States (Z 39. 19 : 2005), and Great Britain (BSI 8723 - 2 : 2005 b), and very well known manuals. The scope and formal issues were analyzed, as well as the conceptual issues for controlled vocabulary. The scope of the Argentine standard is limited to the construction of monolingual thesauri, while the new North-American and British standards also cover different knowledge organization systems. In relation to the formal issues, the Argentine standard has not table of content, analytical index, glossary, bibliography and some sections and annexes, having very few examples. In reference to conceptual issues, some definitions are incorrect or outdated, as well as some recommendations for vocabulary control. We conclude that the Argentine standards should be reviewed and updated in agreement to the recently published standards, and the ISO 25964 standard, still in preparation...|$|E
