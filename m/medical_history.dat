5|$|A second publication, Casualties and Medical Statistics (1931), {{the final}} {{volume of the}} Official <b>Medical</b> <b>History</b> of the War, gives British Empire Army losses by cause of death.

5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} medical imaging {{techniques}} available, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{appears to be}} superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, {{and this has been}} shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> analysis. Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} {{a person with}} a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot, however, be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's <b>medical</b> <b>history,</b> history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Applicant (license holder) must {{be cleared}} by his general {{practitioner}} as being fit to possess, carry {{and use a}} firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. <b>medical</b> <b>history)</b> and a complete physical screening (including eyesight, hearing, balance). The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.|$|E

5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's <b>medical</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the {{war effort}} had a devastating effect on many rosters. The Red Wings lost nine players and the Maple Leafs lost six to the military. The Rangers lost ten players {{and had to be}} persuaded by the other teams not to suspend operations. In contrast, the Canadiens lost only one key player in Ken Reardon. Young phenom Maurice Richard tried to enlist, but was turned down due to his <b>medical</b> <b>history.</b> Canadiens General Manager Tommy Gorman {{reportedly}} ensured his players obtained jobs in key wartime industries to avoid conscription.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a <b>medical</b> <b>history,</b> listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
