Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E

25|$|On curves {{the outer}} rail {{may be at}} a higher level than the inner rail. This is called {{superelevation}} or cant.

25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E

This technique is later refined, first asking with the outside leg aid before adding the inside rein and a push with the inside seat bone.

25|$|The face-down {{swimming}} position {{allows for}} a good range of motion of the arm in the water, {{as compared to the}} backstroke, where the hands cannot be moved easily along the back of the spine. The above-water recovery of the stroke reduces drag, compared to the underwater recovery of breaststroke. The alternating arms also allow some rolling movement of the body for an easier recovery compared to, for example, butterfly. Finally, the alternating arm stroke <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> relatively constant speed throughout the cycle.|$|E
