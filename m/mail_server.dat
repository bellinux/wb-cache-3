5|$|Servers: FreeBSD {{contains}} a significant collection of server-related software {{in the base}} system and the ports collection, {{it is possible to}} configure and use FreeBSD as a <b>mail</b> <b>server,</b> web server, Firewall, FTP server, DNS server and a router, among other applications.|$|E
25|$|OpenBSD {{features}} a full server suite {{and can be}} easily configured as a <b>mail</b> <b>server,</b> web server, FTP server, DNS server, router, firewall, NFS file server, or any combination of these.|$|E
25|$|DNS serves other {{purposes}} {{in addition to}} translating names to IP addresses. For instance, mail transfer agents use DNS {{to find the best}} <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> to deliver e-mail: An MX record provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.|$|E
5000|$|The CBL {{attempts}} to avoid listing real <b>mail</b> <b>servers,</b> but certain misconfigurations of <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> {{can make the}} system appear infected (for example, servers that send HELO with 'localhost' or a similar incorrect domain.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Spamd is {{most useful}} in {{preventing}} inbound spam from reaching <b>mail</b> <b>servers.</b> It {{can also be}} used as a partial application level proxy to ensure that external <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> connecting to internal <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> behave legitimately. Additionally, spamd can be very useful in preventing outgoing spam from systems that may be compromised or under the control of spammers. It can be used to block spammers {{with the use of the}} following features: ...|$|R
50|$|The MX {{mechanism}} {{does not}} grant {{the ability to}} provide mail service on alternative port numbers, nor does it provide the ability to distribute mail delivery across a set of unequal-priority <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> by assigning a weighting value to each one. MX {{can be used to}} distribute delivery across equal-priority <b>mail</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the change}} from MSN to Yahoo, Telecom {{experienced}} much backlash over a change in email set up. Part of the agreement between Yahoo and Xtra provided that Xtra's email addresses be moved over to Yahoo servers in Australia. To access their Yahoo!Xtra Bubble email accounts, customers had to change advanced settings such as port numbers and authentication, in addition to basic settings such as <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted {{a link to}} a {{trove of}} emails sent or {{received}} by then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and released under the Freedom of Information Act. The link contained 1258 emails sent from Clinton's personal <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> which were selected {{in terms of their}} relevance to the Iraq War and were apparently timed to precede the release of the UK government's Iraq Inquiry report.|$|E
25|$|Spamhaus {{distributes}} {{the lists}} {{in the form}} of DNS-based Blocklists (DNSBLs) and Whitelists (DNSWLs). The lists are offered as a free public service to low-volume <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> operators on the Internet. Commercial spam filtering services and other sites doing large numbers of queries must instead sign up for an rsync-based feed of these DNSBLs, which Spamhaus calls its Datafeed Service. Spamhaus outlines the way its DNSBL technology works in a document called Understanding DNSBL Filtering.|$|E

25|$|Beyond the {{distributions}} and tools, the openSUSE Project {{provides a}} web portal for community involvement. The community develops openSUSE collaboratively with its corporate sponsors through the Open Build Service, openQA, writing documentation, designing artwork, fostering discussions on open mailing lists and in Internet Relay Chat channels, {{and improving the}} openSUSE site through its wiki interface. openSUSE offers a stable base with its openSUSE Leap version. Users that prefer more up-to-date free software can use its rolling release distribution Tumbleweed. Users can also use the Open Build Service. Moreover, the flexibility of openSUSE {{makes it easy to}} re-purpose for specific goals like running a web- or <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
2500|$|TYPE is {{the record}} type. It {{indicates}} {{the format of}} the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the A record is used to translate from a domain name to an IPv4 address, the NS record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a DNS zone, and the MX record specifies the <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> used to handle mail for [...] a domain specified in an e-mail address.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the {{dismissal}} of United States attorneys controversy, Jennings communicated with Justice Department officials [...] "concerning the appointment of Tim Griffin, a former Rove aide, as U.S. attorney in Little Rock, according to e-mails released [...] For that exchange, Jennings, although working at the White House, used an e-mail account registered to the Republican National Committee (RNC), where Griffin had worked as a political opposition researcher." [...] The e-mail account was on gwb43.com, a previously unknown domain, hosted on an RNC <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b> [...] Several White House officials were issued private email accounts so they could be extra cautious.|$|E
5000|$|Control of <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> {{remains as}} it is now. With users and their delegates.|$|R
50|$|The MX {{mechanism}} {{provides the}} ability to run multiple <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> for a single domain and allows administrators to specify an {{order in which they}} should be tried. This ability to run multiple <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> proves very valuable for high-availability clusters of inexpensive mail gateways, which can then process hundreds of messages per second in aggregate to quarantine or remove spam and/or viruses.|$|R
50|$|Communication between <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> {{generally}} always {{uses the}} standard TCP port 25 designated for SMTP.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2007 Spamhaus {{requested}} the national Domain registry of Austria, nic.at, to suspend {{a number of}} domains, claiming they were registered anonymously by phishing gangs for illegal bank phishing purposes. The registry nic.at rejected the request and argued that they would break Austrian law by suspending domains, even though the domains were used for criminal purposes, and demanded proof that the domains were registered under false identities. For some time the domains continued to phish holders of accounts at European banks. Finally, Spamhaus put the <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> of nic.at on their SBL spam blacklist under the SBL's policy [...] "Knowingly Providing a Spam Support Service for Profit" [...] for several days which caused interference of mail traffic at nic.at. All of the phishing domains in question have been since deleted or suspended by their DNS providers.|$|E
50|$|When {{configured}} to be {{a backup}} <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> (not the primary MX record), a smart host configuration will accept mail {{on behalf of}} the primary <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> if it were to go offline. When the primary <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> comes back online, mail is subsequently delivered via the smart host.|$|E
50|$|When a host runs its own local <b>mail</b> <b>server,</b> a smart host {{is often}} used to {{transmit}} all mail to other systems through a central <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b> This is used to ease the management of a single <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> with aliases, security, and Internet access rather than maintaining numerous local mail servers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, {{approximately}} 80% of the publicly reachable mail-servers on the Internet ran Sendmail. More recent {{surveys have}} suggested a decline, with 5.06% of <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> in March 2017 detected as running Sendmail {{in a study}} performed by E-Soft, Inc. [...] Other surveys have suggested a slight decrease, with 24% of <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> in August 2015 detected as running Sendmail in a study performed by Mail Radar.|$|R

Available in cloud or for on-premises deployment, IceWarp {{is a great}} tool to share and exchange all information and ideas online, offline or via mobile devices. It runs on Windows {{as well as on}} Linux and current version is 11.4.5. The product was named Merak <b>Mail</b> <b>Server</b> in the past.|$|E
50|$|In August 1999, MAPS {{listed the}} ORBS <b>mail</b> <b>servers,</b> since the ORBS relay testing {{was thought to}} be abusive.|$|R
50|$|For {{publicly}} accessible {{services such}} as web <b>servers</b> and <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> the port number is important. For example, port 80 connects to the web server software and port 25 to a <b>mail</b> <b>server's</b> SMTP daemon. The IP address of a public server is also important, similar in global uniqueness to a postal address or telephone number. Both IP address and port number must be correctly known by all hosts wishing to successfully communicate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>servers</b> sending email bounce {{messages}} {{can use a}} {{range of}} measures to judge whether a return address has been forged.|$|R
5000|$|Multiplexing - {{the proxy}} {{establishes}} downstream {{connections to the}} <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> only as needed, and by intelligently juggling a pool of SMTP connections; this juggling protects the downstream <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> from excessive connection concurrency.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, {{the most}} common way spammers did this was to use open mail relays. An open relay is an MTA, or <b>mail</b> <b>server,</b> which is {{configured}} to pass along messages sent to it from any location, to any recipient. In the original SMTP mail architecture, this was the default behavior: a user could send mail to practically any <b>mail</b> <b>server,</b> which would pass it along towards the intended recipient's <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|Their most {{prominent}} product till {{date has been}} the deepOfix <b>mail</b> <b>server.</b> It is a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution which specialises in <b>mail</b> <b>server</b> solutions.Other products include BeatRoot CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Lamtakpa, which is a contact manager.|$|E
50|$|The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) {{reported}} 55% of <b>mail</b> <b>servers</b> {{were open}} relays in 1998, {{but less than}} 1% in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Comparable {{programmes}} are proprietary groupware servers as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino. EGroupware already {{offers the}} complete administration for various <b>mail</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
