The sector which saw the largest growth during that period however, was metals and engineering which increased by 140%. The food, textiles and wood industries experienced the largest negative change at −42% whereas the electronics industry experienced the biggest fall with £16.2million less than seven years previous.|$|E
5|$|Demand for Juventus {{tickets in}} {{occasional}} home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support {{in other parts}} of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Turin itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 1958, the 1959 season {{was hot and}} dry and McCool's figures improved: he made 1769 runs {{at an average of}} more than 40 runs per innings and took 64 first-class wickets, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any other Somerset season. McCool's final season with Somerset before his retirement was 1960, and he signed off with 1,222 runs and 29 wickets.|$|E

Not {{only did they}} have a new head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over the reins from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E

5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any other country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, {{and knowledge of the}} suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E

In 2011 mutual trade was USD 63.1 billion, 33.9% <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 2010. In 2012, mutual trade was USD 67.9 billion and combined exports reached USD 593.7 billion, while imports were USD 340.9 billion.

5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} {{from the beginning of}} Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, differs from that of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17.

5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> previous elections {{that the party}} had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, {{but there was no}} significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better in the south of England.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of churches that existed in Visby during the Middle Ages is unknown, there were {{certainly}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any other Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This is far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often {{be the result of}} an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
