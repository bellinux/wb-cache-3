500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E

40|$|Master of Visual ArtsMy {{research}} paper {{is an attempt}} to begin to articulate and document my lived experience of being both a mother and an artist. Underpinned by research into the cultural and social history of the experience of mothering and the cultural institution of ‘motherhood’, I revisit and reinterpret some of my earlier works, and explore issues of identity brought up by the relational experience of mothering. I seek out other women who are, or have been, both mothers and artists – particularly sculptors – whose work relates to their subjective experiences of mothering. From them I select and investigate both works, and reflections, which I feel resonate with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> experience of combining the roles of mother and artist. Against this background I describe and interpret <b>my</b> <b>own</b> recent <b>body</b> of work, drawn from my subjective experience of becoming, and being, a mother whilst continuing my artistic practice...|$|R
40|$|My {{visual art}} {{practice}} explores {{the point at}} which a sense of bodily humour and revulsion may intersect {{in the world of the}} monstrous-feminine: the female grotesque, presented as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> obese (and post-obese) body. This exegesis is a written elucidation of my visual art practice as research. As an artist I create performative photographic images featuring taboo or otherwise 'inappropriate' subject matter, situations, materials and behaviours including bodily fluids, offal, internal organs and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> post-obese <b>body.</b> Through these modes of working, I establish and investigate the subjectivity of flesh: Why are we repulsed by the female grotesque? How can this flesh be used to subvert readings of the female body? My research is informed by those understandings of the female body, sexuality and difference described in the work of feminist theorists including Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous, Ruth Salvaggio and Elizabeth Grosz. I explore the work of influential artists such as Eleanor Antin, Carolee Schneeman, Cindy Sherman and Sarah Lucas. In this context, I present <b>my</b> <b>own</b> visual art practice as a point from which the monstrous-feminine can be given voice as sentient, intelligent flesh...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis maps and analyses a dancer’s journey and as that dancer is myself the research investigates the limits and possibilities of self-observation as a methodology. I have taken a term commonly used in dance – transcendence – and {{used it as a}} gateway to explore the invisible experience that is the dancer’s personal process, configuring its key characteristic as a creative tension between restriction and infinite possibility, further explored as the dialogue between embodied technique and the sense of freedom in dance. I explore how my body and experience in dance can be theorised, and what methodological tools are useful in the attempt to better understand the embodied work and invisible inner experience of the dancer. I place myself as the subject of the research and argue for the significance of my lived experience as a cross-cultural journey in the development of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>body’s</b> intelligence. The research addresses specifically a dancer’s body as a site for the interweaving of two different forms of dance, namely Korean dance and Western ballet, and explores the impact of this on the dancer in question. The aesthetic and technical implications of this inter-cultural practice are analysed alongside a study of the culturally inscribed body that in this research draws specifically on a Korean woman's upbringing in Korea. Included with the written thesis are accompanying creative material {{in the form of a}} spoken address and films of original choreography danced by the researcher. An appendix is attached for those interested in knowing more of the choreographic process involved in the dance works...|$|R
30|$|For the {{purposes}} of this article I would like to focus on three specific physiological 'systems' that I feel are particularly relevant for practitioners and teachers of meditation: the respiratory system and how we actually breathe; the cardiovascular system and how our heart actually functions; and the metabolic and thermoregulatory systems and how our body generates and processes energy. The information I discuss here will be most useful for practitioners of those kinds of meditative practices that focus on breath and breath control (pranayama), control of heart rate and blood pressure, and control of body temperature (g Tum-mo meditation). Pedagogically, my method involves posing questions about <b>my</b> students' <b>own</b> <b>bodies</b> and their <b>own</b> personal experiences with and awareness of the way their bodies work. We then explore the scientific answers to these questions together utilizing specific physical activities or 'maneuvers' that help illustrate just what is going on inside.

I introduce gaga, a new language of movement I encountered during my work stay in Israel. Gaga was a powerful impulse that inspired my further work, aimed at conveying my experience by means of lessons in movement. In chapters 3 and 4, I describe my personal progress and lessons in movement, i. e. the process of learning by teaching others. The current form of my lesson is illustrated by pointing out the particular use of influences that inspired me on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> path to <b>body</b> awareness. The last chapter consists of reflections and reactions of students who attend my lessons, thus giving me a valuable feedback.

40|$|This dossier is an {{accompanying}} document to my MFA thesis exhibition, Liquidation (2014). Within my dossier, I articulate the formal and material considerations of my art making practice in which everyday household goods acquired {{primarily from the}} dollar store are manipulated in order to consider the “abject” qualities inherent to these items. Observed through the theoretical work of Julia Kristeva in her essay, Powers of Horror, the “abject” as a term is critically and historically applied to the art objects I create in order to explore the dollar store {{as the basis for}} my material selection, but also as a psychological space in which we inhabit as a culture. Informed by the formal and material concerns of visual artists Jessica Stockholder, Rachel Harrison, and Luanne Matineau, I consider my work in relation to these artistic practices. In turn, I am able to articulate further within this text how the generative process behind my artworks acts as a gestural extension of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> working <b>body.</b> By constructing art objects made out of an accumulated and excessive amount of everyday materials, I position these works as a type of warning of the present consumer state, and as a cautionary tale of an impending future...|$|R

60|$|Philosophically considered, the {{universe}} is composed of Nature and the Soul. Strictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>body,</b> must be ranked under this name, NATURE. In enumerating the values of nature and casting up their sum, I shall use the word in both senses;--in its common and in its philosophical import.

Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man; space, the air, the river, the leaf. Art {{is applied to the}} mixture of his will with the same things, as in a house, a canal, a statue, a picture.

40|$|Situated {{within the}} interrelated fields of {{critical}} race theory and ethnic {{studies and the}} emergent field of creative writing studies, this dissertation interrogates {{the ways in which}} racist state violence is researched, historicized, and reimagined. Specifically, I focus on U. S. v. Narciso and Perez (1977), a court case in which two Filipina migrant nurses, Filipina Narciso and my mother, Leonora Perez, were criminalized and framed by the FBI for poisoning and murdering patients at the Ann Arbor VA Hospital in Michigan. Focusing on this case, I pursue two critical impulses: I blend narrative interventions in critical race theory with contemporary practices in documentary poetics in order to conceptualize, propose, and perform what I call critical race poetics; and, in turn, I perform critical race poetics as an alternative mode for understanding U. S. v. Narciso and Perez in particular and theorizing racist state violence in general. Guided by my mother's insight that "there is no American justice," I begin with an analysis of historical productions about U. S. v. Narciso and Perez, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> previous <b>body</b> of work included. Then, I perform critical race poetics—in the form of a poem cycle—as a way of rearticulating the cultural and historical significances of U. S. v. Narciso and Perez. I argue that critical race poetics is a generative methodology through which archives of racist state violence are critically reassembled, reprocessed, and reanimated. And ultimately, through critical race poetics, I carry out my mother's theoretical insight that for her, for Filipina Narciso, and for other targets of racist state violence, American justice remains elusive, if not impossible...|$|R
