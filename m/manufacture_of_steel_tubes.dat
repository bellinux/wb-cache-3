40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled welded tubes have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on welded tube plastic forming is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure forming, tube bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of welded tubes, finite element modeling for welded tube forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in welded tube plastic forming. This paper summarizes the research progress in welded tube plastic forming from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and light-weight tubes, this paper discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of welded tube plastic forming in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>tubes.</b> Tube-end forming technology, such as tube flaring and flanging technology, will expand its application in welded tubes. Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the plastic forming process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of welded tubes, and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of welded tubes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} look into the causes of fire {{response}} and post-fire bearing capacity <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> tubular columns protected with different materials, the fire test was conducted for a set <b>of</b> circular <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> protected with different materials such as gypsum fireproof panel, bamboo plywood and the ordinary lumber core plywood, and the <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> without any protective material. The fire response temperature <b>of</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> is measured and the axial compressive bearing capacity of the specimens after fire are tested and analyzed. The test results show that gypsum fireproof panel has the best fire protection characteristics, the ordinary lumber core plywood and bamboo plywood can also retard rising of the surface temperature <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> during the initial 35 min although they are combustible materials. It is found that the post-fire bearing capacity <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> protected with different materials varies evidently, and the maximum value of response temperature has the greatest effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{local and}} post-local {{buckling}} behaviour <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> in thin-walled circular concrete-filled steel tubular columns under axial load is presented. Geometric and material nonlinear {{finite element analysis}} is conducted on <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> under uniform edge compression to determine critical local and post-local buckling strengths. The local and post-local buckling <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> reduces the ultimate loads of thinwalled circular CFST columns under axial compression. Limited experimental research on CFST columns has been conducted. The effects of local and postlocal buckling on the behaviour of thin-walled circular CFST columns have not been adequately researched. Three-dimensional finite element models are developed using the finite element technique. Initial geometric imperfections, residual stresses, material yielding and strain hardening are considered in the analysis. Based on the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analysis, a set of design formulas is proposed for determining the critical local buckling loads and ultimate strengths <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> in thin-walled circular CFST columns. The proposed design formulas are verified by comparisons with existing experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study into the behavior <b>of</b> concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns confined by fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Eleven columns were tested to investigate the effects of the FRP layer number, the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> and concrete strength on their load capacity and axial deformation capacity. The experimental results indicated that the FRP wrap can effectively confine the concrete expansion and delay the local buckling <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>tube.</b> Both the load capacity and the axial deformation capacity <b>of</b> concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns can be substantially enhanced with FRP confinement. A model is proposed to predict the load capacity of the FRP-confined concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns.

There are many factors that have some degree of influence on the external pressure that produce the collapse <b>of</b> a <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> among them 3 - 9 : 1. The relation (outside diameter/thickness) (D/t ratio). 2. The yield stress <b>of</b> the <b>tube</b> <b>steel</b> (s y). 3. The work - hardening <b>of</b> the <b>tube</b> <b>steel.</b> 4.

40|$|Concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{are widely}} adopted in many {{structures}} nowadays {{attributed to the}} superior behaviour developed by the composite action. However, the composite action cannot be fully developed because of different dilation properties <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> and concrete in the elastic stage. Moreover, due to the inelastic outward buckling <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> CFST columns may suffer serious degradation. To overcome these problems, external confinement, such as rings, ties, spirals and FRP wraps have been studied recently and proven experimentally to have potential in improving the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns. In this paper, an experimental database containing 422 uni-axial compression test results of unconfined and externally confined CFST columns has been assembled. In addition, a theoretical model has been proposed for predicting the uni-axial behaviour of circular CFST columns. This model consists of mainly three components: (1) Constitutive model of confined concrete modified from Attard and Setunge’s actively confined concrete model. (2) Constitutive model <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> under complex stress-state using Prandtl-Reuss theory. (3) The interaction among external confinement, <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> and core concrete based on new a hoop strain equation. The validity of the proposed model has been verified by comparing the predicted results with the experimental database...|$|R
