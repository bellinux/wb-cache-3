5000|$|In Umueze Anam {{death is}} seen as {{returning}} {{to the land of}} the ancestors,a person could only journey {{to the land of the}} ancestors if he led a good life while on earth he will be accepted by the ancestors and becomes the guardian and intercessors before God (Chukwu Obiama) for their people, but if the person led a bad life he is banished to abyss and will be crushed. For a deceased to have a smooth passage tothe land of the ancestors a befitting burial ceremony. it is the belief that the deceased not properly buried will remain a wanderer and become an evil spirit tormenting people and manifesting in all forms.In Umueze Anam when a child dies it signifies a bad omen. It is either the child is an ogbanje or killed by witches, the child is buried that day without any ceremony or ritual. The child is not buried at home but in the bush so that such spirit will not reincarnate again to tomment the parent. If the child is buried is suspected to be an ogbanje the corpse will be given a mark so that when he or she comes again he can easily be identified and treated with caution and disdain. For the death of a youth who is not married it is said that na okpali avala, which means that the death is untimely. The entire community will be calm since it is a taboo to hear that a youth died in some cases the age grade and family member will consult a diviner to know the cause of the death since according to the belief of the community such deaths is often caused by witches, oracle or evil deeds of either the parents, ancestors or the person in question. The notion is that if the death is not natural anybody participating in such may incur the wrath of the gods. If the cause is not natural the gods are appeased before the person can be buried and if it is caused by an oracle the corpse is either bailed from the oracle or returned to the oracle. During the burial the age grade assembles to perform the burial (igba okwa). The age grades during this burial exudes high degree of rage and bitterness during the igba okwa they will break anything that is kept along their part. They will patrol with blue powder and will pour it on any youth that did not join them in the mourning. There will engage in wrestling (ITU nyajili) and no weakling comes out during this period because such a person will be thrown on the floor. Every member of the age grade and any other youth shall contribute a token called utu mmanya this is necessary because the bereaved family is not expected to be burdened by the age grade. The family shall provide a goat known as ewu ikpo this will be used for onya is I ceremony. Onya is I ceremony is when the members of the age grades gather and people who are very friendly or known to the deceased shall come one after the other to eulogize the dead. They will come to testify on their encounter with the dead either as a friend or even a for or that they entangled in a wrestling bout. Onya isi is usually a solemn affair and at the end the bereaved family will confer and decide who is more closer to the dead that will kill the goat. When the person kills the goat, he is giving a knife to cut the goat and he will parade the town with the goat head to the admiration of the community he is expected to provide one carton of beer for the burial of his friend (itu uni). The mourning period for youths and persons not up to the age of okpokolo is 12 days (Izu ito).Burial of a woman married to an Anam man is not so complex. The children or family members is expected to notify the family of the deceased woman (ndi ikwu nneve) through a ritual called igbaje icho they are expected to present to the family a big metal pan or bowl, a paddle (eku), a metal cup (this signifies the return of the woman's cooking utensils presented to her by her parents). When this is done the woman's family will then prepare to attend the burial of the woman with their masquerade, or kindred igba, and with items for itu uni. If the woman's paternal home is close, the corpse may be taken to their house for final visit before burial. Umuotu will be notified of the burial of their colleague and they will come and perform the oni ozu and ire akwo. Umuada will also come and perform their own oni ozu while the inyemu ndi uno will perform the ritual of ire akwo. For family that is buoyant they will use a cow to perform the ire akwo and oni ozu but for those not buoyant ogu Akpa ego into (4000) will be paid to represent the cow. Ire akwo ceremony is performed by one of the daughters inlaw of the women who took care of the woman very well. This ceremony is usually done on the 12th day of the burial (Izu ito). There is also a ceremony called Ike omaba for the deceased this is usually done for those that took the iyom title (ive okpu). One of the daughter or daughter inlaw of the deceased will tie wrapper with special knotches and with an appe (hand fan) dances round the village with her fellow woman singing songs that eulogizes the deceased while sympathizers spray them money.For every other person who is neither an Oba title holder or among Okpokolo age grade there are not much attachment to their burial. Their burial activities end after Izu ito but for an Oba title holder who has performed the ichi Muo ceremony and has attained the age of okpokolo the burial extends up to izu isa (28 days).When an elderly man who is an Oba title holder dies, the first thing that is done is the idapu ozu, this includes what is called ote kpim kpim. The family of the deceased is expected to go house to house of his fellow elders and Oba title holders to notify them that the Ogbuevi has joined his ancestors and he is about to be laid in state. The Oba title holders shall first come to inspect the corpse to know if he is properly kept and dressed in his regalia. After this the ukolo is brought and played in a sound that will notify the entire village that a great man has joined his ancestors. The next is itupu okwa izizi (oso nkodo nkodo). The immediate family members are expected to adorn themselves with the regalia of the deceased such as otachi, okpu Mme, ooke, nza, etc. while the ada carries the ubom that is beaten by her. Such men according to our culture is usually buried in the night except for Christians whose corpse will be taken to the church to be prayed for.Burial in Anam is usually done in the night, and the ceremony continues in the evening with the age grades of the children and other extended family members supporting their bereaved colleagues with their music. The reason for this burial at night is because our people being predominantly farmers usually use the day to do their farm works and gathers during the night to continue with leisure it is not peculiar with burials alone. The bereaved family members entertains his age grade with drinks and food. A foul is killed in the early morning around 5am and it is called Okuku nlavochi and subsequently with ewu okwa the next evening. If he invites the entire Anam Mkpu isa he will kill seven fouls as oku nlavo chi and one cow as Ewu okwa. Recently people no longer use Okuku for nlavo chi but ewu. The age grade musicians entertains the age grade throughout the night after the ito onu token is presented. The members of the age grade contributes tokens to the bereaved as a means of cushioning his expenses. This contributions depends on how popular the person is and also if he does same for people as the list of benefactors are recorded.The next day, the in-laws, well wishers and friends come for itu uni, they will come with a piece of cloth, drinks, goat, cow and money depending on the person's capabilities. Some in-laws will come with dance groups or even masquerade. Ndi Nna Oche will come with their music and masquerade and when they are going they will be given a goat, ram or cow depending on relationships and capability of the bereaved family. This will continue until the next morning when ewu nsekute will be killed to mark the end of the first burial. The funeral room and the bed is left with the clothes, regalias and other precious ornaments of the deceased kept daily until after izu ito or izu isa as the case may be. For a woman who is an item her Ookpu (ivory) is displayed and for titled men his Ooke (elephant tusk) is kept and it is blown by the eldest son.During the lying in state of the deceased, when the corpse is laid, the wife or wives will be paraded to cry for the deceased that night they will be eulogizing the deceased as they sit beside the corpse faning it with a hand fan until it is buried. The same is done by the husband if the deceased is a woman. After the corpse is buried the spouses are made to sit on a mat in the funeral room everyday till izu ito and Izu isa is completed. During that period while the deceased are laid in state the wife puts on her best clothes and ornaments as it was when they wedded but the next day the spouses puts on nkilika okala (rag) during this period of nkilika okala he or she is not expected to talk to anyone their only duties is to come out before anybody wakes to cry in the morning after that crying he or she is given water to wash the face and goes inside. This is so because it is believed that the deceased spirit has not sojourned to the land of ancestors. This continues till after Izu ito for deceased woman or a man who has not attained the age of okpokolo and Izu is a for titled elderly man. After the isa oni ozu ritual will be performed to send the ancestors to the land of the dead before the wife will then start wearing agbo (white cloth) she can start talking to people but will not go out till after six months before she will then change the clothing to black and mourn for another one year. The period of mourning in Anam before was 18months until recently it was reduced to six months and the wearing of black removed. During the period of her wearing black, she is free to move about and talk to people but cannot see any man.After the burial ceremony, every morning and evening the first daughter (Ada) is expected to dress in her father's chieftaincy regalia and with ubom, which she will beat round the town eulogizing the father and notifying the village of the death of the father till a day before Izu ito and Izu isa as the case may be. When she gets to the frontage of any elder she while greet the person in the name of the late father and if she does it well people will be giving her money (ego ubom). She represents her late father every time she does that and on returning she will place the ubom in front of their house and puts the regalia and red cap on the ubom. That ubom standing outside represents the late father who is still believed to be hovering round the house.For a titled man during the izu ito, the first son shall be painted with uye wearing Ogoro and red cap with feather and oche mgbo on his armpit, he will be going round the titled men's house greeting them and they in return gives him money and drinks this rite is called ite uye after that during the izu isa the kindred parades the town with their communal drum while the children dressed on their fathers regalia dances as they parade this rite is called ipu ive isa. It is after this rite that the funeral room is dismantled. It is the custom of the land that the eldest son and daughter stays at home throughout the mourning period without going anywhere while the others are expected to provide them with all the support and feeding they needed. If they cannot as a result of their work, somebody will volunteer to stay on their behalf while they are expected to pay a fine and provide the person staying with the drinks and food needed to carry him and the strangers that will be coming throughout that period.Another rite of importance is the Ooni ozu, as an Ogbuevi, the children is expected to present to ndi Oba a live cow that will be shared by them and some money for snuff. If the family could not afford a cow, they will pay Ogwu akpego (4000) in place of the cow.The next is ikwabi ozu rite, this rite is done so that the spirit of the deceased can sojourn to the land of the ancestors. The age grade of the deceased gathers, with the closest family relative of the deceased among the age grade being in charge of the ceremony. An okposi is provided, the first rite is the olokpu azu, smoked sizeable fishes are provided with red oil and salt, this will be used to invoke the spirit of the dead on the okposi, the remainder of the fish is used to prepare very thick ogbono soup that is shared among all present. After this one Ikenga ewu is killed and the blood spilled over the okposi and it is used to prepare nsala soup, after invocation and appeasing of the spirit of the deceased to setforth his journey and join the good ancestors to intercede for them, the okposi is pushed outside with leg by the Celebrant (igbapu okposi n'lo), which means that he has accepted the sacrifice and has departed. This rite releases the wife of the man from the deceased so that she can start communication with others except for sexual intercourse.The spouse of the bereaved is expected not to shave or comb her hair until the period of mourning is over this is a sign to any man who makes advances to steer clear of the woman. After the period of mourning she is expected to shave her hair and burn her <b>mourning</b> <b>cloths.</b> When <b>mourning</b> is over the children of the deceased shares the belongings of their father including the pieces of clothes brought during itu uni. Also during that time they decide on who will kuchie the woman hence the popular saying that [...] "nwanyi si ana akpa nkata aru eji ke ive diee si tinye kwe maka onye ya ekuchi ya" [...] It is supposed to be the responsibility of the uncle to kuchie the deceased wife or the first born son if the woman is her step mother.The burial rite for the eldest man in the community (Diokpala) is similar to that of the titled men but the slight difference is that when the diokpala dies, the corpse is hidden for three native years (about 2years) the burial is the responsibility of the entire community all the age grade will have their stand bring their music and prepare their dishes. The first thing in the morning of the burial is the ada masquerade performance, the night will be the akpali masquerade by 12am and subsequently the odumodu masquerade. After the burial and mourning of the deceased, the next to the eldest man will perform the ikpoche eziobi rite so that he can ascend the throne. Odumodu masquerade performs for elders who are a member of irukpo age grade as well.|$|R

50|$|William Schaw was {{the second}} son of John Schaw of Broich, and {{grandson}} of Sir James Schaw of Sauchie. Broich is now called Arngomery, a place at Kippen in Stirlingshire.

William's father was denounced as a rebel and his property forfeited when he and his family failed to appear at court, but the family were soon re-instated. At this time William may have been a page at the court of Mary of Guise, as a page of that name received an outfit of black <b>mourning</b> <b>cloth</b> when Mary of Guise died.

50|$|Before 1848 repressions {{intensified}} in the Grand Duchy, censorship was strengthened, settlers of German ethnicity {{were brought}} in. Large patriotic demonstrations {{were held in}} memory of Antoni Babiński, {{a member of the}} Polish Democratic Society. He had been wounded by a gunshot, when the Prussian gendarme attempting to arrest him, engaged in a fight with him. Babiński was then captured, sentenced to death and executed in Poznań. His public execution in February 1847 was accompanied by public <b>mourning.</b> <b>Cloth</b> soaked in his blood and other remains were distributed as national relics. Large prayers were held in his memory, often against orders of Prussia. Members of such gatherings were persecuted by police. At the same time the national self-awareness grew among the rural population of Polish and German ethnicity alike. Whereas two thirds of the grand ducal population identified as ethnically Polish (mostly in the centre, south and east), one third envisioned themselves as being of German ethnicity. Anti-Prussian sentiment grew as response to policy of Germanisation and repression by Prussian authorities and the conspiracy organisation called Związek Plebejuszy found a potent ground. It was led by bookseller Walenty Stefański, poet Ryszard Berwiński and lawyer Jakub Krauthofer-Krotowski.|$|E
