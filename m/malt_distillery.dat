5000|$|The {{distillery}} operated {{with only}} two stills until 1958. Starting at that time, they began to add stills to increase production capacity, eventually reaching production of 12.5 million litres of whisky per year during the 1970s. Although in 1987 Tomatin {{was referred to as}} the largest <b>malt</b> <b>distillery</b> in Scotland, stills have been dismantled since the mid-1980s, bringing their total capacity to just over 5 million litres, though as of 2007, they were only producing 2.5 million litres.|$|E
50|$|Tomatin {{is perhaps}} best known for being the home of Tomatin whisky which, with its 23 stills, was the largest <b>malt</b> <b>distillery</b> in Scotland during the 1970s. Although it is thought that whisky has been {{distilled}} on the site since the 16th century, when cattle drovers would buy from a local still, the distillery was not established until 1897 under the name of Tomatin Spey Distillery Co Ltd. In 1986 it was taken over by Japanese conglomerate Takara Shuzo and was renamed The Tomatin Distillery Co Ltd. The number of stills have since been reduced to 12 and recently it was the first distillery in Scotland to install a wood pellet boiler, in 2012.|$|E

50|$|The {{distillery}} {{was founded}} in 1893 by John Morrison, who bought the land from the Duke of Fife to produce whisky for Haig's after several springs on the southern slope of Knock Hill were discovered. The site was also chosen for its proximity to the Knock Station on the Banff branch line of the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) between Aberdeen and Elgin. Not only was the new location convenient to the railway {{but it was also}} within a few miles of a district noted both for its barley and inexhaustible source of excellent peat. The distillery was built using local eye grey granite, with two steam heated stills. The two pot stills could turn out 2,500 gallons of spirit per week. It was also the first <b>malt</b> <b>distillery</b> built for the Distillers Company Ltd. It started production in 1894 and remained in continuous operation until 1931, when it was forced to close for a few years due to the economic depression. Wartime restrictions on barley forced a second closure from 1940-1945.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the brewing of beer, Alloa {{is the site of}} the former Carsebridge Distillery. According to Alfred Barnard, the Victorian historian of British distilling and brewing, the distillery was founded as a <b>malt</b> <b>distillery</b> by John Bald in 1799. In the 1840s it was converted into a grain distillery and by the time of Barnard's visit in the mid 1880s the distillery covered 10 acres, employed 150 people, and had an annual output of 1.4 to 1.7 million gallons of pure grain whisky. The distillery's owner John Bald and Co was one of five companies that combined to form the Distillers Company Limited in 1877. In 1902, a fire devastated the distillery, after World War I it was refitted and started producing yeast. This yeast production lasted until 1938. In 1956 the distillery was modernised, it expanded in 1966 and in the 1970s a new still house, cooperage and animal feedstuffs plant added. By 1980 the Carsebridge Distillery was the largest grain distillery in Scotland, however it closed in 1983 and was demolished in 1992. One of the distillery's Coffey stills is now in use at the Cameronbridge distillery.|$|E
5000|$|John Distilleries {{is based}} in Bangalore, but its single <b>malt</b> <b>{{distillery}}</b> is located in Goa. The distillery has one set of Indian-made copper pot stills (wash and spirit) that can produce 3000 litres daily. Maturation {{takes place in a}} climate-controlled underground cellar that has around 10,000 Bourbon barrels. The company had been making blended whisky since its foundation in 1992, but decided to manufacture single malt whisky in 2008 in an attempt to enter the premium end of the market. Master distiller Michael John (no relation to founder Paul John) chose to use Indian ingredients in the first bottling, to give the whisky characteristics of its country of origin. The wash he created had an abv of 5%, lower than the standard 8% for most whisky. This creates a sweeter flavour in the final product. The whisky is put in the casks at 55% abv, but the alcoholic strength increases as it ages due to the heat, giving the final product an abv of 57%. Goa features a tropical monsoon climate, and being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, seeing day temperatures of over 35°C (95°F) coupled with high humidity. The monsoon rains arrive by early June and last till late September. Goa has a short winter season between mid-December and February. These months are marked by nights of around 21 °C (68 °F) and days of around 28 °C (84 °F) with moderate amounts of humidity. The hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during aging, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 10-12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. This leaves a hogshead with only 150 bottles left in it, after three years, compared to around 350 in a Scotland. Michael John describes it this way, [...] "Whisky matured at these temperatures simply cannot be aged for the kind of time expected with Scotch, even trying to mature our whisky for just 10 years would leave barely a bottle of liquid in the barrel. Fortunately, the heat actually speeds up the maturation process considerably. As a result, whisky that has been matured for just 4-5 years - {{as is the case with}} Paul John Edited and Brilliance - is equivalent to a Scotch that has been aged for around 15 years".|$|E
