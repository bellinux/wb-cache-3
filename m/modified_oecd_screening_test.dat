40|$|For {{predicting}} the environmental {{fate of a}} chemical a knowledge of its biodegradability is essential. Several kinds of tests, standardized by the OECD and EEC for the determination of ultimate biodegradability (mineralization), are available. The degradation is determined by nonspecific analyses such as the measurement of DOC (e. g. <b>modified</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test),</b> microbial oxygen uptake (modified MITI test; manometric respirometry test) or the microbial release of COsub 2 (modified Sturm test). For testing the biodegradability of two stroke engine oils a special test {{was developed by the}} CEC (Co-Ordination European Council) : the CEC L- 33 -T- 82. In this test the criterion for biodegradability is the elimination of the characteristic CHsub 3 CHsub 2 - groups as determined by IR-spectroscopy. Comparative studies with three synthetic lubricant base stocks revealed that significant differences may occur for this substance class. The degradation of the three substances was 100 percent in the CEC-te st, whereas in the manometric respirometry test degradation levels below 40 percent were obtained; in the modified Sturm test the degradation was between 44 and 85 percent. In the manometric respirometry test no substance fulfilled the criterion of ready biodegradability, whereas all three substances reached the pass level in the CEC- test. Results obtained in the CEC-test and in mineralization tests should be in good agreement when no significant formation of microbial biomass and no formation of hydrophilic metabolites takes place. Both parameter contribute to a high percentage of biodegradation in the CEC-test, but low apparent biodegradability in tests for ultimate biodegradability...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands three internet-based self-screening {{tests have}} been developed; the National Hearing Test (NHT), Earcheck (EC), and Occupational Earcheck (OEC). These tests are {{adaptive}} speech-in-noise tests using either digit triplets or monosyllables, presented in stationary speech-shaped noise. These tests {{can be highly}} valuable in increasing the awareness and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study evaluates these online speech-in-noise tests and investigates their potential to detect NIHL. In a multi-centre study {{the results of the}} three online <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> are compared to pure-tone audiometry and to the Dutch sentence SRT test (Plomp & Mimpen, 1979 a), which is considered the clinical standard. Study sample: In total, 49 normal-hearing listeners and 49 patients with different degrees of NIHL participated. The online tests show good reliability, but there is much overlap in outcomes between normal-hearing listeners and participants with early NIHL. In addition, rather low correlations of the test results with both the Dutch sentence SRT test and pure-tone thresholds are found. These findings result in rather low test sensitivity: 54 % (NHT) and 51 % (EC), or low specificity: 49 % (<b>OEC).</b> The online <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> in their current form are unsuitable to be used for early NIHL screening purpose...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{olfactory}} receptor axons {{grow from}} the peripheral {{to the central}} nervous system (CNS) aided by olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), the transplantation of OECs has been suggested as a plausible therapy for spinal cord lesions. The problem with this hypothesis is that OECs do not represent a single homogeneous entity, but, instead, a functionally heterogeneous population that exhibits a variety of responses, including adhesion and repulsion during cell-matrix interactions. Some studies report that the migratory properties of OECs are compromised by inhibitory molecules and potentiated by chemical gradients. In this paper, we report a system based on <b>modified</b> <b>OECs</b> carrying magnetic nanoparticles as a proof of concept experiment enabling specific studies aimed atInt. J. Mol.

40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) {{transplantation}} is {{a promising}} strategy for treating {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI), as has been demonstrated in experimental SCI models and naturally occurring SCI in dogs. However, the presence of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix of the glial scar can inhibit efficient axonal repair and limit the therapeutic potential of OECs. Here we have used lentiviral vectors to genetically <b>modify</b> canine <b>OECs</b> to continuously deliver mammalian chondroitinase ABC at the lesion site in order to degrade the inhibitory chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans in a rodent model of spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that these chondroitinase producing canine OECs survived at 4 weeks following transplantation into the spinal cord lesion and effectively digested chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans {{at the site of}} injury. There was evidence of sprouting within the corticospinal tract rostral to the lesion and {{an increase in the number}} of corticospinal axons caudal to the lesion, suggestive of axonal regeneration. Our results indicate that delivery of the chondroitinase enzyme can be achieved with the genetically <b>modified</b> <b>OECs</b> to increase axon growth following SCI. The combination of these two promising approaches is a potential strategy for promoting neural regeneration following SCI in veterinary practice and human patients...|$|R

A total of 563 S. aureus isolates were tested. Two hundred ninety-six of the isolates were methicillin-susceptible isolates from cultures of blood from consecutive patients. Also, 267 methicillin-resistant isolates that comprised 248 different phage types were tested. Methicillin resistance {{was defined as the}} presence of the mecA gene. Of the 267 mecA gene-positive isolates, 263 were positive by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (sensitivity, 98. 5 %), and all the mecA-gene negative strains were negative by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (specificity, 100 %).

40|$|Summary. The {{accuracy}} (sensitivity and specificity) {{of a new}} <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> can {{be compared}} with that of a standard test by applying both tests to a group of subjects in which disease status can be determined by a gold standard (GS) test. However, it is not always feasible to administer a GS test to all study subjects. For example, a study is planned to determine whether a new <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> for cervical cancer (“ThinPrep”) is better than the standard test (“Pap”), and in this setting it is not feasible (or ethical) to determine disease status by biopsy in order to identify women with and without disease for participation in a study. When determination of disease status is not possible for all study subjects, the relative accuracy of two <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> can still be estimated by using a paired screen-positive (PSP) design in which all subjects receive both <b>screening</b> <b>tests,</b> but only have the GS test if one of the <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> is positive. Unfortunately in the cervical cancer example, the PSP design is also infeasible because it is not technically possible to administer both the ThinPrep and Pap at the same time. In this article, we describe a randomized paired screen-positive (RPSP) design in which subjects are randomized to receive one of the two <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> initially, and only receive the other <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> and GS if the first <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> is positive. We derive maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals for the relative accuracy of the two <b>screening</b> <b>tests,</b> and assess the small sample behavior of these estimators using simulation studies.

The goal of our review is to inform research on the design and promotion of public health programs to increase cancer screening. MethodsUsing the PubMed and EconLit databases, we identified studies published in English from January 1990 through July 2013 that measured preferences for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> attributes using conjoint analysis or a discrete-choice experiment. We extracted data on study characteristics and results. We categorized studies by whether attributes evaluated included <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> health care delivery characteristics, or both. ResultsTwenty-two studies met the search criteria. Colorectal cancer was the most commonly studied cancer of the 3. Fifteen studies examined only <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> attributes (efficacy, process, test characteristics, and cost). Two studies included only health care delivery attributes (information provided, staff characteristics, waiting time, and distance to facility).
