[...] Nilsen had previously performed there as a backing singer for Jens Carelius. [...] The festival features four stages, and during Nilsen's opening song, [...] "Ta meg med" [...] (Take <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you),</b> {{it was possible to}} hear the soundcheck of the black metal band, Nekromantheon, but Nilsen seemed unaffected. [...] Among concert reviews, Nilsen was described by one writer as [...] "a fascinating hybrid of melancholy, vulnerable sweetness and inner strength..." [...] This was Nilsen's first concert since the Rockefeller in March 2012, and since giving birth to a daughter two months previous. [...] Commenting on the most recent phase of her life, Nilsen said, [...] "Now I've also got a million new things to write about, there's so much I want to say." ...|$|E
