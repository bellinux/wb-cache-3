5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} <b>money</b> <b>away</b> from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

25|$|The {{main cause}} for the {{continued}} weakness of the Transitional Government is the refusal by the former warring parties to give up power to a centralised and neutral national administration.

A high level of official corruption siphoning <b>money</b> <b>away</b> from civil servants, soldiers and infrastructure projects causes further instability.|$|E

25|$|The MRAP {{program has}} been criticized for its high, nearly $50billion cost, the {{potential}} logistical difficulties due to high fuel consumption and varied designs, a greater disconnection between troops and the local population due to MRAPs' massive size and menacing appearance conflicting with current counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy, and unclear disposal. In 2007, it was unknown what the U.S. military would do with MRAPs following its withdrawal from Iraq, since they are expensive to transport and operate.

25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel <b>money</b> <b>away</b> from purchasing additional coins.|$|E

It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going.

500|$|As a leader, Hassett was {{regarded}} as an outstanding success. In that era, the tours were accompanied by much ceremony, and captains were expected to make many appearances with dignatories at dinner parties and make speeches. He had his players participate in cultural activities such as dancing and singing with indigenous tribesmen, and {{reached out to the}} local children, interspersing his presentations with self-deprecating jibes. As the teamâs boat departed for home, Hassett tossed his remaining <b>money</b> <b>away</b> among the local children. The Australian High Commission hailed him as the most effective Australian diplomat to have visited South Africa. Of his on-field performances, the historian Chris Harte wrote that [...] "Hassettâs captaincy impressed from the start. His warmth of personality and sense of fun contrasted with Bradmanâs efficient but cold methods. It was a happy tour with the players remembering particularly the hospitality offered to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Buren, {{faced with}} the {{economic}} Panic of 1837, caused in part by {{lack of confidence in}} private bank note issues after Jackson had instructed the government to only accept gold or silver, called a special session of Congress. [...] Government money had been held in so-called [...] "pet banks" [...] since Jackson had withdrawn it from the Second Bank; Van Buren proposed to place funds in sub-treasuries, government depositories that would not lend money. Believing that government funds should be lent to develop the country, Fillmore felt this would lock the nation's limited supply of gold <b>money</b> <b>away</b> from commerce. Van Buren's sub-treasury and other economic proposals passed, but as hard times continued, the Whigs saw an increased vote in the 1837 elections, and captured the New York Assembly. This set up a fight for the 1838 gubernatorial nomination. Fillmore supported the leading Whig vice presidential candidate from 1836, Francis Granger; Weed preferred Seward. Fillmore was embittered when Weed got the nomination for Seward, but campaigned loyally; Seward was elected, while Fillmore won another term in the House.|$|E
500|$|In May 2002, {{the club}} was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor's plan to market it in the United States. Persimmon, which had bought 10% of the shares in BCH, {{submitted}} planning applications for 93 homes {{on the site of}} Bootham Crescent, and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor. The club entered a creditors' voluntary agreement in November 2002, and the York Evening Press said York had been [...] "plunged into the darkest, coldest days of its history". The club went into administration in December 2002, and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face bankruptcy. The ST donated Â£92,000 to give the club a temporary reprieve. The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the Inland Revenue accepted an offer of Â£100,000 as payment for Â£160,000 owed in tax. Steve Beck became the new chairman. Batchelor had diverted almost all of the Â£400,000 Persimmon sponsorship <b>money</b> <b>away</b> from York to his racing team, and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised. He left the club with a profit of Â£120,000 and admitted to asset stripping during his time as owner. Despite the off-field problems, York pushed for promotion in 2002â03 and were in an automatic promotion place by late March 2003. They won none of their last six matches and finished the season in 10th place.|$|E
