5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to <b>monetary</b> <b>easing</b> from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

30|$|In {{view of that}} {{international}} capital movements which are extremely hard to restrict, the trilemma could be reduced to the dilemma, i.e., the incompatibility of monetary policy autonomy and stable foreign exchange rates. In a real world in which international capitals move freely more than ever, stable exchange rates can only be maintained by forsaking the independence of domestic monetary policies. For instance, when the Fed implements loose monetary policy, China imports <b>monetary</b> <b>ease</b> passively; when the Fed tightens up, China tightens up along with the USA. Otherwise, if China wants to tailor its monetary policy to domestic economic conditions independently, then China must accept exchange rate fluctuations.|$|R

In a remark endorsed by US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, the IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde said that recent concerns about a possible currency war had been [...] "overblown". Paul Krugman has echoed Eichengreen's view that central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to boost growth, not as currency war. Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi has suggested that rising stock markets imply that market players generally agree that central bank's actions are best understood as <b>monetary</b> <b>easing</b> and not as competitive devaluation. Other analysts have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk. Central bank officials ranging from New Zealand and Switzerland to China have made fresh statements about possible further interventions against their currencies.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we argue, first, that the Maastricht-inspired policy mix of {{monetary}} and fiscal restriction applied {{during the first}} half of the 1990 s is, to a significant extent, responsible for the build-up of both the unemployment rate and the government debt to GDP ratios on the European continent. We also contrast this European policy mix with the one applied by the US authorities during the same period, and conclude that the US policy mix of fiscal restriction and <b>monetary</b> <b>ease</b> was more appropriate to reduce budget deficits and debt. Second, we evaluate the risk of the application of monetary and fiscal restriction in the future EMU.

The following results were empirically obtained {{on the basis of}} individual firms and the 47 regional data in the 2000 s in Japan. The first result is that funding demand regionally increases where the relative size of private capital stock is large. This result suggests that industrial agglomeration complements <b>easing</b> <b>monetary</b> policy to induce regional funding demand. The second result is that regional banking soundness in lending markets also contributes to an increase in the funding demand.

40|$|We use {{simulations}} of the Federal Reserve's FRB/US model {{to examine the}} efficacy {{of a number of}} proposals for reducing the consequences of the zero bound on nominal interest rates. Among the proposals are: a more aggressive monetary policy; promises to make up any shortfall in <b>monetary</b> <b>ease</b> during the zero-bound period by keeping interest rates lower in the future; and the adoption of a price-level target. We consider two assumptions about expectations formation. One assumption is fully model-consistent expectations (MCE) [...] a reasonable assumption when a policy has been in place for some time, but perhaps less so for a newly announced policy. We therefore also consider the possibility that only financial markets have MCE, and that other agents form their expectations using a small-scale VAR model estimated using historical data. All of the policies noted above are highly effective at reducing the adverse effects of the zero bound under MCE, but their efficacy drops considerably when households and firms base their expectations on the historical average behavior of the economy, and only investors fully recognize the economic implications of the various proposals.

40|$|Did <b>monetary</b> <b>ease</b> in the 1980 s cause Japan's bubble, as {{is often}} suggested? Drawing on both a new cross-national {{consideration}} of the monetary policy-asset price linkage and a re-examination of what actually occurred in Japan 1985 - 1990, I conclude the bubble was {{just as likely to}} occur whatever monetary policy within reason would have done. Did the bubble's burst cause Japan's Great Recession? In fact, Japan's recession of 1990 - 94 was mild, and only a combination of policy mistakes turned this normal recession into extended stagnation. This is borne out by cross-national investigation suggesting the frequency of extended downturns following asset booms is relatively low. Comparing the post-bubble response of the US and Japanese economies, did the bubble itself impede restructuring? Given very different responses in the two economies to similar bubbles, a bubble itself is not sufficient to cause real-side disruption. What central bankers should learn from Japan's bubble is the benefits of a more thoughtful approach to assessing potential growth and of easing rapidly in the face of asset price declines, not any concern for targeting asset prices per se...|$|R
40|$|In the {{era that}} {{has come to be known}} as the Great Moderation (dating from the mid- 1980), the Federal Reserve’s policy {{committee}} pursued what has to be called a learning-by-doing strategy. The data that counted as relevant feedback—largely the unemployment rate and the inflation rate—seemed all along to be suggesting that the Fed was doing the right things. Even the year-long period when the target for the fed funds rate was one percent (June 25, 2003 to June 20, 2004) appeared, to the Fed and to many Fed watchers, to be keeping the economy on an even keel—and keeping US interest rates in line with those in other countries. The historically low interest rates were attributed not to excessive <b>monetary</b> <b>ease</b> in the US but to a worldwide increase in savings. But then came the two-year-long ratcheting up of the fed funds target (June 20, 2004 to June 29, 2006) from one percent to 5. 25 % to stave off inflation, followed by an even steeper ratcheting down (September 18, 2006 to April 30, 2007) to 2. 0 percent in response to softening labor markets and increasingly troubled credit markets.

The main features of the model are the existence of two co-integrating equations representing the long-run credit demand and supply and the possibility for loading and lagged-term coefficients to assume different values depending on the <b>monetary</b> policy regime (<b>easing</b> or tightening). The paper finds that the effect on credit, GDP, and prices of a monetary policy tightening is larger than the effect of a <b>monetary</b> policy <b>easing.</b> This result supports the existence of an asymmetric broad credit channel in the euro area. monetary policy transmission, credit market, credit view, asymmetries...|$|R
