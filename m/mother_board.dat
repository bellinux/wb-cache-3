2500|$|A {{consulting}} company in San Leandro, California, IMS Associates Inc., wanted to purchase several Altair computers but the long delivery time convinced {{them that they}} should build their own computers. In the October 1975 Popular Electronics, a small advertisement announced the IMSAI 8080 computer. The ad noted that all boards were [...] "plug compatible" [...] with the Altair 8800. The computer cost $439 for a kit. The first 50 IMSAI computers shipped in December 1975. The IMSAI 8080 computer improved on the original Altair design in several areas. It was easier to assemble: The Altair required 60 wire connections between the front panel and the <b>mother</b> <b>board</b> (backplane.) The IMSAI motherboard had 18 slots. The MITS motherboard consisted of 4 slots segments {{that had to be}} connected together with 100 wires. The IMSAI also had a larger power supply to handle the increasing number of expansion boards used in typical systems. The IMSAI advantage was short lived because MITS had recognized these shortcomings and developed the Altair 8800B which was introduced in June 1976.|$|E

50|$|The SFP {{transceiver}} is not standardized by {{any official}} standards body, but rather is specified by a multi-source agreement (MSA) among competing manufacturers. The SFP was designed after the GBIC interface, and allows greater port density (number of transceivers per cm {{along the edge}} of a <b>mother</b> <b>board)</b> than the GBIC, which is why SFP is also known as mini-GBIC. The related Small Form Factor transceiver is similar in size to the SFP, but is soldered to the host board as a through-hole device, rather than plugged into an edge-card socket.|$|E

5000|$|The pre-amplifiers are {{designed}} to accept signals from source components without overloading, and Naim claims total stability and a very wide open-loop bandwidth.

5000|$|The {{story begins}} on a fine summers morning, when San-woo (Yu Seung-ho)) and his <b>mother</b> <b>board</b> {{a bus to}} the country.

His mother is taking him {{to live with his}} 78-year-old mute, but not deaf, grandmother (Kim Eul-boon) while she looks for a new job after a business venture failed in Seoul. Eventually they reach their destination, a dusty bus stop in the Korean countryside near an unsophisticated village. By now Sang-woo, who has arrived with junk food and toys, has no intention of respecting his mute grandmother especially as her house has neither electricity nor running water. His mother apologises for leaving the boy, telling her own mother it will not be for too long before leaving on the next bus. Alone Sang-woo ignores his grandmother, not even wanting to look at her even calling her a byungshin, or [...] "retard". Next morning, his grandmother starts another day. She goes down the hill to get clean water and washes her clothes at the river. She also tends the melons that she will sell at the market.|$|E
