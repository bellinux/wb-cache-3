40|$|An {{objective}} {{synoptic climatology}} of photochemical smog episodes in Sydney, Australia, are presented. This climatology was produced using multivariate statistical techniques including principle component analysis and cluster analysis {{in order to}} assign days into <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> synoptic categories. The meteorological inputs to these statistical inputs include both surface and upper air observations for warm months - October to March, over a ten year period, 1992 - 2001. Days in which Sydney's air quality may {{have been affected by}} bushfires were removed from analyses. The results from the research are expected to be useful from the forecast point of view for future sources in Sydney and surrounding areas. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Hydrologic {{parameters}} such as rainfall, runoff etc vary both {{in space}} and time. For most of the hydrological models, {{one of the main}} elements involved is rainfall-runoff process. Determination of the amount of average rainfall or runoff that a given storm event will produce on each subbasin is of prime importance as it is major cause of error in the applied hydrology. To take care of the spatial variability, the watershed is divided into various sub-basins with hydro <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> characteristics like rainfall pattern to arrive at representative spatial runoff. Larger the number of sub-basins, better is the accuracy. Using modern tools of geospatial technology(SRS,GIS) as well as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), it is possible to achieve the objectives of representative as well as more accurate spatial rainfall and concurrent runoff.

40|$|Two very {{dissimilar}} cold frontal occlusions deposited 6 mm and 60 mm of rain respectively at an observatory in {{the rural}} northeastern U. S. A. Water precipitation was carefully observed. {{in conjunction with other}} meteorological parameters, through both storm systems. The concentration of several ionic substances were measured in specimens of rain water collected during <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> portions of the two storms. The rate of chemical precipitation was determined with respect to water precipitation. This rate was constant during the prefrontal stage of both storms, and increased following cold frontal passage, in the convective side of the systems. Analyses of the time rate of chemical precipitation showed it to be constant during the continuous rain of April 5. Examinations of the ratio of chloride to sodium through the time history of the storms shows them to agree with a transport model postulated by Rossby and Egner (1955). Although the two storms varied considerably with respect to convectivity and prevailing flow, the total amounts of the several ions precipitated were directly proportional to the amount of water precipitated. 1...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of {{tropospheric ozone}} often exceed Australian air quality goals in Sydney during summer. However, {{features}} in the occurrence of ozone in Sydney are yet to be fully explained. Meteorological conditions associated with ozone episodes in Sydney are caused by complex interactions between synoptic and meso-scale processes. This paper discusses the meteorological influences behind ozone pollution episodes in Sydney. A synoptic climatology of ozone episodes in Sydney was generated using multivariate statistical techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and a two-stage cluster analysis, to classify days into <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> synoptic categories. Surface and upper air meteorological data for warm months (Oct–Mar) over a 10 -year period were used as input into the statistical analyses. Eleven synoptic categories were identified in Sydney during the warm season and ozone concentrations associated {{with each of the}} synoptic categories were investigated. One synoptic category was found to be associated almost exclusively with high pollution concentrations. High ozone concentrations were found to be associated with a high-pressure system located in the middle to eastern Tasman Sea producing light northwesterly gradient winds, an afternoon sea breeze, high afternoon temperatures, a shallow mixing height at the coast and warming aloft during the day. Over 90 % of all days exceeding current air quality goals for ozone in Sydney fell within the synoptic category associated with the highest ozone concentrations. It is envisaged that results from this research will be useful to Australian regulatory bodies from both a forecast point of view and for the siting of future ozone precursor sources in Sydney and surrounding regions. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Intermittent {{preventive}} antimalarial {{treatment in}} infants (IPTi) is currently evaluated as a malaria control strategy. Among the factors influencing {{the extent of}} protection that is provided by IPTi are the transmission intensity, seasonality, drug resistance patterns, and the schedule of IPTi administrations. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine how far the protective efficacy of IPTi depends on spatio-temporal variations of the prevailing incidence of malaria. Methods One thousand seventy infants were enrolled in a registered controlled trial on the efficacy of IPTi with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in the Ashanti Region, Ghana, West Africa (ClinicalTrial. gov: NCT 00206739). Stratification for the village of residence and the month of birth of study participants demonstrated that the malaria incidence was dependent on spatial (range of incidence rates in different villages 0. 6 – 2. 0 episodes/year) and temporal (range of incidence rates in children of different birth months 0. 8 – 1. 2 episodes/year) factors. The range of spatio-temporal variation allowed ecological analyses of the correlation between malaria incidence rates, anti- Plasmodium falciparum lysate IgG antibody levels and protective efficacies provided by IPTi. Results Protective efficacy of the first SP administration was positively correlated with malaria incidences in children living in a distinct village or born in a distinct month (R 2 0. 48, p 2 0. 63, p Conclusion The spatial and temporal variations of malaria incidences in a geographically and <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> study area exemplify the need for close monitoring of local incidence rates in all types of intervention studies. The increase of the protective efficacy of IPTi with malaria incidences may be relevant for IPTi implementation strategies and, possibly, for other malaria control measures. </p...|$|E
40|$|In flood {{frequency}} analysis, the modeling based on Annual Maximum Flood (AMF) series {{remains the most}} popular approach. An alternative approach based on the “partial duration series (PDS) or peaks over threshold (POT) ” has been considered in recent years, which captures more information about extreme events by fixing appropriate threshold values. The PDS approach has lot of advantages, (i) it consist more peak events by selecting the appropriate threshold hence to capture more information regarding the flood phenomena. (ii) it analyses both, the time of arrival and the magnitude of peaks, (iii) it provides extra flexibility in the demonstration of floods and a complete explanation of the flood generating process. However, the PDS approach remains underused and unpopular due to the nonexistence of general framework regarding different approaches. The first objective of the present research work {{is to develop a}} framework in the above question on selection of an appropriate threshold value using different concepts and, to verify the independency and stationarity criteria of the extreme events for the modeling of the PDS in the Mahanadi river system, India. For the analysis, daily discharge data from 22 stations with record length varying between 10 and 41 years have been used with the assumption that the whole basin is homogeneous in nature. The results confirmed that the Generalized Pareto (GP) best described the PDS in the study area and also, show that the best PDS/GP performance is found in almost all the value of λ (2, 2. 5 and 3). In the second phase, the analysis is done to carry out the regional {{flood frequency}} analysis in the Mahanadi basin and to apply the developed model to the respective homogeneous region. Regionalization is the best viable way of improving flood quantile estimation. In the regional flood frequency analysis, selection of basin characteristics, morphology, land use and hydrology have significant role in finding the homogeneous regions. In this work the Mahanadi basin is divided into homogeneous regions by using fifteen effective variables initially. However, it has been observed that the whole basin is not hydro <b>meteorologically</b> <b>homogeneous.</b> Therefore, Factor analysis has been introduced in finding suitable number of variables, and nine variables are found suitable for analysis. Hierarchical (HC) and K-Means Clustering (KM) techniques are used for finding out the possible number of clusters. Here, again the Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution best described the PDS in the study area. To test the homogeneity and to identify the best-fit frequency distribution, regional L-moment algorithm is used. A unique regional flood frequency curve is developed which can estimate the flood quantiles in ungauged catchments and an index flood is also specified concerning the catchment characteristics by using the multiple linear regression approach...|$|E
