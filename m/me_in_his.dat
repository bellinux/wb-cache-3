25|$|The amiable Rev. James Sherman, at {{that time}} {{minister}} of Surrey Chapel, with his accustomed kindness took <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> carriage to the dinner; and afterwards, for four months, not only made me his guest, but made his house my home. I never lived so long with any other person, on the same terms. While I live, that dear gentleman will seem {{to me as a}} most generous fatherly friend.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

This meant that script editor Douglas Adams, aided by Graham Williams, had to perform a complete rewrite of the story {{over the course of a}} weekend. According to Adams, Graham Williams [...] "took me back to his place, locked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days, and there was the script". The revised script, now titled The Curse of the Sephiroth, was credited to [...] "David Agnew", a standard pseudonym used by the BBC and which had been previously used on Doctor Who for the season fifteen serial The Invasion of Time. The serial was subsequently retitled City of Death on 8 May 1979. Adams would later reuse elements of City of Death, along with the unfinished Doctor Who serial Shada (1979; 2003), in his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987). In Part One, Romana makes a throwaway reference to a great art gallery called the Braxiatel Collection; the Virgin New Adventures novel series would later expand on this, introducing the character Irving Braxiatel, a Time Lord. Braxiatel also appears in the Bernice Summerfield series of novels and audio dramas and in the Gallifrey series of audio dramas.|$|E

2500|$|However, it {{does not}} appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's {{response}} to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: [...] "I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars." [...] Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tränker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: [...] "Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing The Book of the Law of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments of yourself and Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), and designating <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> last letter as his successor." [...] In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in Capricorn, Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, [...] "in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior." [...] Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor.|$|E

According to Dombal, [...] "Countdown" [...] finds Knowles as the female protagonist {{delivering}} her [...] "message of ten years of loyalty" [...] to her love interest. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love". Kicking off with a reggae-ish beat, horns and drums, Knowles starts to chant the introductory lines, which also serves as the pre-chorus lines, [...] "Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling / Still the one I need, I will always be with you / Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go / Say it real loud if you fly / If you leave me you're out of your mind", followed by the chorus lines, which is a literal count backwards where Knowles counts down the ways in which she loves her man, [...] "My baby is a ten / We dressing to the nine / He pick me up at eight / Make me feel so lucky seven / He kiss <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> six / We be making love in five / Still the one I do this four / I’m trying to make a three / From that two / He still the one." ...|$|E
