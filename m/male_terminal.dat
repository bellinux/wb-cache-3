50|$|Protandry is {{the general}} rule among the Digenea. Usually two testes are present, but some flukes can have more than 100. Also present are vasa efferentia, a vas deferens, seminal vesicle, {{ejaculatory}} duct and a cirrus (analogous to a penis) usually (but not always) enclosed in a cirrus sac. The cirrus {{may or may not}} be covered in proteinaceous spines. The exact conformation of these organs within the <b>male</b> <b>terminal</b> genitalia is taxonomically important at the familial and generic levels.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{has both}} {{terminals}} in a snap connector on one end. The smaller circular (<b>male)</b> <b>terminal</b> is positive, {{and the larger}} hexagonal or octagonal (female) terminal is the negative contact. The connectors on the battery {{are the same as}} on the connector itself; the smaller one connects to the larger one and vice versa. The same snap-style connector is used on other battery types in the Power Pack (PP) series. Battery polarization is normally obvious since mechanical connection is usually only possible in one configuration. A problem with this style of connector is that it is very easy to connect two batteries together in a short circuit, which quickly discharges both batteries, generating heat and possibly a fire. Because of this hazard, 9-volt batteries should be kept in the original packaging until {{they are going to be}} used. An advantage is that several nine-volt batteries can be connected to each other in series to provide higher voltages.|$|E

5000|$|Example: wrasses (Family Labridae) are a {{group of}} reef fish in which {{protogyny}} is common.

In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase <b>male</b> and a <b>terminal</b> phase <b>male.</b> Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial.

40|$|The Indo-Pacific labrid fish genus Pseudocoris Bleeker is {{represented}} by nine species: three pairs of sibling species that split between the Indian and Pacific Oceans and three endemic to {{various parts of the}} Pacific Ocean. Two of the species pairs include a new species for the Indian Ocean sibling. Pseudocoris heteroptera (Bleeker) is now considered limited to the Pacific Ocean, ranging from the Line Islands to Indonesia, north to Taiwan and southern Japan, and south to the Great Barrier Reef, while Pseudocoris occidentalis n. sp. is from the western Indian Ocean. The <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> of both species have a large dark bar anteriorly on the body, followed by a series of irregular black bars; the Indian Ocean species differs by having shorter bars, a bright yellow anal fin in the <b>terminal</b> <b>male,</b> and the juveniles blue becoming yellow posteriorly. Pseudocoris yamashiroi (Schmidt) is now considered limited to the Pacific Ocean, wide-ranging from Japan, Taiwan, and the Marshall Islands, south to Samoa and New Caledonia, while Pseudocoris hemichrysos n. sp. is from the islands of the western Indian Ocean, including Maldives, Mascarenes, and Chagos; the <b>terminal</b> <b>males</b> of the new species differ by having a bright yellow-orange area on the rear upper body and soft dorsal fin. The third sibling-species pair had already been split; comprising the Pacific Pseudocoris bleekeri (Hubrecht) from Indonesia north to Ryukyu Islands, the <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> with a broad bright yellow bar on midside of body, flanked by numerous dark bars and ovals, and Pseudocoris petila Allen & Erdmann, named for its slender body. The latter was described from two initial-phase specimens from the Andaman Islands, and an underwater photograph of the <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> from NW Sumatra (the range is extended southwest to the island of Réunion and South Africa based on underwater photographs of terminal males); the <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> of P. petila differs by having two yellow bars on the midside of the body. The three endemic Pacific species comprise Pseudocoris aequalis Randall & Walsh from the Coral Sea and southern Queensland, the <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> bright blue without elongate anterior dorsal spines; Pseudocoris aurantiofasciata Fourmanoir, wide-ranging in the Pacific (with records in the eastern Indian Ocean at Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands), the largest species (to 193 mm SL), with the greatest body depth (to 2. 9 in SL), the adult male with a narrow white bar on the side and with two long caudal-fin filaments; and Pseudocoris ocellata Chen & Shao from Taiwan and Japan, the <b>terminal</b> <b>male</b> with a large, irregular, blue-edged black spot on midside.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Trichadenotecnum enderleini (Roesler, 1943) is {{the only}} native species of the genus known from Australia to date. However, its exact {{systematic}} position is not firmly fixed mainly {{due to the lack}} of information on taxonomically and phylogenetically important morphological characters. In this study, T. enderleini is examined morphologically to clarify further its systematic position. The forewing markings and <b>male</b> <b>terminal</b> structures clearly show that the species lacks all apomorphies of Trichadenotecnum Enderlein, 1909 and is thus only distantly related to the genus. Therefore, T. enderleini is excluded from Trichadenotecnum. Ptycta floresensis Endang, Thornton & New, 2002 from Indonesia is considered to be the closest relative of T. enderleini, and T. enderleini is consequently transferred to the genus Ptycta Enderlein, 1925. As a result, Australia is excluded from the distributional range of Trichadenotecnum, except for T. circularoides Badonnel, 1955 considered to be introduced...|$|E
