The rooftop catchment systems at seven study sites of different residential buildings were simulated for dry, normal, and wet water years, using 31 -year rainfall records. The trial and error approach and <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> method were employed to optimize the volume of reservoirs in five different operation scenarios. Results showed that, during the dry water year from 2000 to 2001, for reservoirs with volumes of 200 – 20000  L, the proportion of days that could be secured for non-portable water supply was on average computed to be 16. 4 %– 32. 6 % across all study sites. During the normal water year from 2009 to 2010 and the wet water year from 1995 to 1996, for reservoirs with volumes of 200 – 20000  L, the proportions were 20. 8 %– 69. 6 % and 26. 8 %– 80. 3 %, respectively. Therefore, a rooftop catchment system showed a high potential to meet {{a significant portion of}} non-potable water demand in the Birjand climatic region.

Two basic methods of earthwork allocations are available: <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> and linear programming.

However, the usefulness of <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> diminishes for situations in which haul costs are not directly proportional to the haul distance; swell and shrinkage vary along the roadway; and additional quantities of soil are available at borrow pit or may be disposed of at disposal sites.

Geographic information system (GIS) is employed to acquire and analyze spatial data. Fleet Production and Cost Analysis (FPC) is used as software tool to select the best Fleet.

This would imply that ignoring the effects of disk self-gravity can lead to large systematic errors in the measurement of black hole mass. We examine their methods and find that their large estimated disk masses are likely the result of bias in their data collection process and their use of projected instead of 3 -dimensional position and velocity information. To place better constraints on the disk masses of Keplerian maser systems, we incorporate disk self-gravity into a 3 -dimensional Bayesian modelling program for maser disks and also evaluate constraints based on the physical conditions for disks which support water maser emission.

40|$|Context. One {{of the key}} {{questions}} of the star formation problem is whether brown dwarfs (BDs) form {{in the manner of}} stars directly from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core (star-like) or whether BDs and some very low-mass stars (VLMSs) constitute a separate population that forms alongside stars comparable to the population of planets, for example through circumstellar disk (peripheral) fragmentation. Aims. For young stars in Taurus-Auriga the binary fraction {{has been shown to be}} large with little dependence on primary mass above approximate to 0. 2 M-circle dot, while for BDs the binary fraction is < 10 %. Here we investigate a case in which BDs in Taurus formed dominantly, but not exclusively, through peripheral fragmentation, which naturally results in small binary fractions. The decline of the binary frequency in the transition region between star-like formation and peripheral formation is modelled. Methods. We employed a dynamical population synthesis model in which stellar binary formation is universal with a large binary fraction close to unity. Peripheral objects form separately in circumstellar disks with a distinctive initial mass function (IMF), their own orbital parameter distributions for binaries, and small binary fractions, according to observations and expectations from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based computations. A small amount of dynamical processing of the stellar component was accounted for as appropriate for the low-density Taurus-Auriga embedded clusters. Results. The binary fraction declines strongly in the transition region between star-like and peripheral formation, exhibiting characteristic features. The location of these features and the steepness of this trend depend on the mass limits for star-like and peripheral formation. Such a trend might be unique to low density regions, such as Taurus, which host binary populations that are largely unprocessed dynamically in which the binary fraction is large for stars down to M-dwarfs and small for BDs. Conclusions. The existence of a strong decline in the binary fraction - primary <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> will become verifiable in future surveys on BD and VLMS binarity in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. The binary fraction -primary <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> is a diagnostic of the (non-) continuity of star formation along the mass scale, the separateness of the stellar and BD populations, and the dominant formation channel for BDs and BD binaries in regions of low stellar density hosting dynamically unprocessed populations...|$|E

With this new values a <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> is constructed, constraining the possible mass intervals for the system. The possible orbital inclination range was restricted using the fact that RR Pic presents shallow eclipses.

The most conspicuous differences are found between the HeI and HeII tomograms, the former has a ring shape, while the second is filled at low velocities, suggesting that the low velocity emission is not coming from the accretion disk.

40|$|We use {{broadband}} photometry {{extending from}} the rest-frame UV to the near-IR to fit the individual spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 63 bright (L(Ly-alpha) > 10 ^ 43 ergs/s) Ly-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the redshift range 1. 9 < z < 3. 6. We find that these LAEs are quite heterogeneous, with stellar masses that span over three orders of magnitude, from 7. 5 < log M < 10. 5. Moreover, although most LAEs have small amounts of extinction, some high-mass objects have stellar reddenings as large as E(B-V) ~ 0. 4. Interestingly, in dusty objects the optical depths for Ly-alpha and the UV continuum are always similar, indicating that Ly-alpha photons are not undergoing many scatters before escaping their galaxy. In contrast, the ratio of optical depths in low-reddening systems can vary widely, illustrating the diverse nature of the systems. Finally, we show that in the star formation rate (SFR) -log <b>mass</b> <b>diagram,</b> our LAEs fall above the "main-sequence" defined by z ~ 3 continuum selected star-forming galaxies.

Recent studies {{have begun to}} explore the molecular-level link between terrestrial and aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers and estuaries and their receiving oceans or lakes. This is of interest because of DOM‟s roles in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and its reactivity with trace metals and anthropogenic organic molecules.

40|$|We {{present a}} class of models with {{radiative}} neutrino mass and stable dark-matter candidates. Neutrino mass is generated by a one-loop diagram with the same topography as Ma's 2006 proposal (which used an inert scalar-doublet and singlet fermion). We generalize this approach and determine all variants with new fields no larger than the adjoint representation. When the neutrino <b>mass</b> <b>diagram</b> contains a Majorana mass insertion there are two possibilities, {{both of which are}} known. If the mass insertion is of the Dirac type there are seven additional models, two of which are excluded by direct-detection experiments. The other five models are also constrained, such that only scalar dark-matter is viable. There are cases with an inert singlet, an inert doublet, and an inert triplet, providing a natural setting for inert N-tuplet models of dark matter, with the additional feature of achieving radiative neutrino mass. We show that some of the models admit a simple explanation for the (requisite) discrete symmetry, and briefly discuss cases with representations larger than the adjoint, which can admit a connection to the astrophysical gamma-ray signal.

We find that the majority of our local PSG population have neither early- nor late- type morphologies but occupy a well-defined space within the colour-stellar <b>mass</b> <b>diagram,</b> most notably, the low-mass end of the "green valley" below the transition mass thought to be the mass division between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass passively-evolving bulge-dominated galaxies. Our analysis suggests that it is likely that a local PSG will quickly transform into "red", low-mass early-type galaxies as the stellar morphologies of the "green" PSGs largely resemble that of the early-type galaxies within the same mass range. We propose that the current population of PSGs represents a population of galaxies which is rapidly transitioning between the star-forming and the passively-evolving phases. Subsequently, these PSGs will contribute towards the build-up of the low-mass end of the "red sequence" once the current population of young stars fade and stars are no longer being formed. These results are consistent with the idea of "downsizing" where the build-up of smaller galaxies occurs at later epochs. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolution}} of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which {{has been shown to}} reproduce the observed redshift z= 0. 1 colour-magnitude distribution well. The median u-r of star-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z= 2 to 0 at fixed stellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red sequence starts to build-up around z= 1, due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z= 1, which is mostly filled in by z= 0.

To avoid losses during the filling, an optimized design of the inlet port is necessary...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{chemical}} evolution models for ellipticals, spirals and irregular galaxies, {{we aim at}} investigating the physical meaning and the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation {{as well as how}} this relation is connected with galaxy morphology. {abridged} We assume that galaxy morphologies do not change with cosmic time. We present a method to account for a spread in the epochs of galaxy formation and to refine the galactic mass grid. (abridged) We compare our predictions to observational results obtained for galaxies between redshifts 0. 07 and 3. 5. We reproduce the mass-metallicity (MZ) relation mainly by means of an increasing efficiency of star formation with mass in galaxies of all morphological types, without any need to invokegalactic outflows favoring the loss of metals in the less massive galaxies. Our predictions can help constraining the slope and the zero point of the observed local MZ relation, both affected by uncertainties related to the use of different metallicity calibrations. We show how, by considering the MZ, the O/H vs star formation rate (SFR), and the SFR vs galactic <b>mass</b> <b>diagrams</b> at various redshifts, it is possible to constrain the morphology of the galaxies producing these relations. Our results indicate that the galaxies observed at z= 3. 5 should be mainly proto-ellipticals, whereas at z= 2. 2 the observed galaxies consist of a morphological mix of proto-spirals and proto-ellipticals. At lower redshifts, the observed MZ relation is well reproduced by considering both spirals and irregulars. (abridged) Comment: 20 pages, 13 figures, accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysic...|$|R
