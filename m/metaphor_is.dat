25|$|The Plumed Serpent, an {{ideogram}} of {{the metaphor}} of Quetzalcoatl, alludes {{to one of the}} most powerful forces of nature. A Said <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> recorded in the Nahuatl language:Quetzalcoatl: he was the wind; he was the guide, the road sweeper of the rain gods, of the masters of the water, of those who Brough rain. And when the wind increased, it was said, the dust swirled up, it roared, howled, became dark, blew in all directions; there was lightning; it grew wrathful.The metaphor served to not only describe a powerful seasonal phenomenon, but was also the title of rulership and priestly office; additionally, the name figured in Toltec ties as a military title and emblem.|$|E
25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell them to do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{the work}} is to clarify the {{contemporary}} conception of metaphor and to find ways of its use in school education on this basis. In the first part, <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> shown as a common element of human understanding of the world. The basic terminology, principles and categories of <b>metaphor</b> <b>are</b> explained and <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> distinguished from similar phenomenons such as analogies, similes and metonymies. Then general communication and cognitive options and functions of <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> explained and conclusions arising from researches into child comprehension and production of <b>metaphor</b> <b>are</b> introduced. In the second part, opportunities of application in school education <b>are</b> considered. <b>Metaphors</b> <b>are</b> assumed to be a specific method which can be used to achieve an array of teaching aims. Conditions of this use are considered in the light of subject matters and relation between a teacher and a student. Potential risks of metaphors used in school education are introduced and treated. In conclusion, <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> pondered in context of metacogniton and two basic metacognitive strategies are described illustratively which also serves as a methodical illustration for teachers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metaphors</b> can <b>be</b> {{processed}} as comparisons or categorizations (Gibbs 2 ̆ 6 Colston, 2012). The {{quality of}} metaphor hypothesis suggests that inapt <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> processed as comparisons and apt <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> processed categorizations (Glucksberg 2 ̆ 6 Haught, 2006).

Participants rated the comprehensibility of metaphors. The results suggest that low SND <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> processed as categorizations whereas high SND <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> processed as comparisons. In the case of metaphors made up of high SND, an abstract topic is more favourable for categorization than a concrete topic. A new model is proposed to explain how semantic characteristics affect comparison and categorization processes...|$|R
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{take the}} term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute {{consisting of two}} or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse grand viðar “bane of wood” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse sól húsanna “sun of the houses” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), specifically those where “he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English forstes bend “bond of frost” = “ice” or winter-ġewǣde “winter-raiment” = “snow”: “A <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device {{in many parts of the}} world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{takes the}} title of her fourth {{autobiography}} from a poem by Georgia Douglas Johnson, a Harlem Renaissance writer. Critic Lyman B. Hagan states that although the title is [...] "less striking or oblique than titles of her preceding books," [...] it is appropriate because Johnson's poem mentions a caged bird and provides a connection to Angelou's first autobiography, whose title was taken from a poem by Paul Lawrence Dunbar. The title suggests Angelou's painful loneliness and exposes a spiritual dilemma also present in her first volume. Johnson's use of the <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> different from Dunbar's because her bird is a female whose isolation is sexual rather than racial. The caged bird may also refer to Angelou after her failed marriage, but writer Mary Jane Lupton says that [...] "the Maya Angelou of The Heart of a Woman is too strong and too self-determined {{to be kept in}} a cage".|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>metaphors</b> <b>is</b> a classical research theme in linguistics, but has received very little attention in psychological research so far. Metaphor analysis—as conceptualized in cognitive linguistics—is proposed {{here as a}} qualitative method for psychological research for several reasons. <b>Metaphors</b> <b>are</b> culturally and socially defined, yet they also represent a basic cognitive strategy of analogical problem solving. <b>Metaphors</b> <b>are</b> context-sensitive, {{yet at the same}} time they are abstract models of reality much in the same way as mental models and schemata in cognitive psychology. The multifaceted properties of metaphors allow for the study of micro-interactions between cognition and culture in open and qualitative research designs. They also enable the bridging of the gap between quantitative-experimental and qualitative approaches in psychology.

40|$|What is the {{relation}} between metaphors and similes? Aristotle’s “comparison theory ” holds that <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> elliptical similes: “Sam is a pig ” is simply a short form of “Sam is like a pig. ” In con-trast, it has <b>been</b> suggested that <b>metaphors</b> cannot <b>be</b> elliptical similes because <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> “stronger ” than similes. We know <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> stronger, it is argued, because of examples involv-ing corrections, such as “Peter is not just like a rock, he is a rock. ” The argument from corrections can be challenged on logical and empirical grounds. The ability to correct a simile with a metaphor does not entail that <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> stronger than similes when used on their own, {{which is likely to}} be the most frequent case. Although four experiments indicate that when corrections <b>are</b> involved, <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> indeed stronger than similes in several respects, alas a further four experiments indi-cate that these differences are largely eliminated when <b>metaphors</b> and similes <b>are</b> used on their own. We note that this pattern of results is consistent with the comparison theory, and we offer an expla-nation of the effects of corrections. The relationship between metaphors and similes, a subject of debate since antiquity, is still a controversial topic in philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and literary studies. On the surface, metaphors such as “the king is a lion...|$|R
500|$|It is {{possible}} to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> a group of separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each [...] "soap bubble" [...] of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as the Universe, just as we call our moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse. With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to each other. In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative. Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.|$|E

500|$|Lucy's [...] "untrodden ways" [...] are {{symbolic}} of both her physical isolation and the unknown {{details of her}} thoughts and life. The third quatrain is written with an economy intended to capture the simplicity the narrator sees in Lucy. Her femininity is described in girlish terms. This has drawn criticism from those who see the female icon, {{in the words of}} literary scholar John Woolford, [...] "represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity". To evoke the [...] "loveliness of body and spirit", a pair of complementary but paradoxical images are employed in the second stanza: the solitary, hidden violet juxtaposed to the publicly visible Venus, emblem of love and first star of evening. Wondering if Lucy more resembles the violet or the star, the critic Cleanth Brooks (1906–1994) concludes that while Wordsworth likely views her as [...] "the single star, completely dominating [...] world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly", the <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> a conventional compliment with only vague relevance. For Wordsworth, Lucy's appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion and her perceived affinity with nature.|$|E
500|$|Albatrosses {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most legendary of all birds". An albatross is a central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge; a captive albatross is also a metaphor for the poète maudit in a poem by Charles Baudelaire. It is from the Coleridge poem that the albatross <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> derived; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have [...] "an albatross around his neck", the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who killed the albatross. There is a widespread myth that sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross, {{due in part to the}} poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them, as reported by James Cook in 1772. On the other hand, it has been reported that sailors caught the birds but let them free again; the possible reason is that albatrosses were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors, so killing them was supposed to bring bad luck. The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape Horners, i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title [...] "albatrosses" [...] in the Cape Horners' organisation.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs.

Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E

The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997, [...] "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world". The downside to the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her <b>metaphor</b> <b>is</b> so prevailingly dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades: [...] "River of Grass" [...] describes one.

As a point of departure, the thesis adopts the direct access view of metaphors in which <b>metaphors</b> <b>are</b> regarded as unambiguous expressions which <b>are</b> interpreted as <b>metaphors</b> directly. <b>Metaphors</b> have primarily <b>been</b> researched in monolingual studies such as Glucksberg (2001) and Inhoff et al.
