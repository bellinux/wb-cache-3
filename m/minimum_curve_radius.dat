25|$|For {{those lines}} {{constructed}} {{to a lower}} standard, speed can be increased via numerous methods including realigning rail lines to increase the <b>minimum</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius,</b> {{reducing the number of}} intersections, or introducing tilting trains to improve the speed of trains running on those lines.|$|E
25|$|Shinkansen routes are {{completely}} separate from conventional rail lines (except Mini-shinkansen which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is {{not affected by}} slower local or freight trains, and {{has the capacity to}} operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without road crossings at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a <b>minimum</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō Shinkansen).|$|E
25|$|The metro {{is mostly}} underground; surface {{sections}} include sections on viaduct in Paris (lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) {{and at the}} surface in the suburbs (lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines some stations (for example, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low <b>minimum</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of line 14.|$|E
50|$|As of 1995, {{the width}} of the track {{formation}} for planning purposes, depending on track curvature, was between 13.30 and 13.70 m and a distance between track centres was 4.70 m. The latter was later reduced to 4.50 m. The reduced <b>minimum</b> vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> was 22,500 m with a normal <b>minimum</b> vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of 25,000 m.|$|R
50|$|The <b>minimum</b> railway <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is the {{shortest}} allowable design radius for railway tracks under {{a particular set of}} conditions. It has an important bearing on constructions costs and operating costs and, in combination with superelevation (difference in elevation of the two rails) in the case of train tracks, determines the maximum safe speed of a <b>curve.</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>radius</b> of <b>curve</b> is one parameter in the design of railway vehicles as well as trams. Monorails and guideways are also subject to minimum radii.|$|R
50|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> for railroads {{are governed}} by the speed {{operated}} and by the mechanical ability of the rolling stock {{to adjust to the}} curvature. In North America, equipment for unlimited interchange between railroad companies are built to accommodate 350 ft radius, but normally 410 ft radius is used as a minimum, as some freight cars are handled by special agreement between railroads that cannot take the sharper curvature. For handling of long freight trains, a minimum 717 ft radius is preferred.|$|R
25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds and loads hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of those lines and <b>minimum</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of those lines, the maximum speed of those through service {{is still the same}} as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E

500|$|With the {{construction}} of the Bergen Line, which was completed in 1909, it was decided that there would be built branch lines to two fjords, the Hardanger Line to Hardangerfjord and the Flåm Line to Sognefjord.
