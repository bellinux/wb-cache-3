5000|$|Most hoppers hold about 200 paintballs, {{and many}} modern {{electropneumatic}} markers can empty a full hopper in 10 seconds of sustained fire. In woodsball, {{and especially in}} scenario paintball, a player may be away from a base at which they can reload {{for an extended period}} of time. In speedball, the necessity of suppressing fire requires a very large amount of paint for a single game or match. In both cases, a harness with pods allows a player to have a portable supply of paint, without weighing down his or her marker with an enormous hopper. Harnesses capable of carrying a tank in addition to pods are usually labeled with a +1 (e.g. A harness capable of carrying four pods and a tank would be labeled 4+1). In addition, newer harness design make use of collapsible [...] "expansion sleeves" [...] in between the [...] "main" [...] sleeves.

40|$|ObjectivePulmonary {{inflammatory}} pseudotumor is an uncommon disease, {{often with a}} benign presentation. However, invasion of adjacent thoracic organs, local recurrence, and distant metastases have been described, and the best management strategy remains unclear. We present a single large institutional experience in patients with pulmonary {{inflammatory pseudotumor}} and propose guidelines for treatment of this patient population. MethodsA retrospective study was performed to review all patients who underwent resection for pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor between 1974 and 2007. ResultsA total of 25 patients were treated with pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor at the Marie Lannelongue Hospital. The mean age was 33 years. Two patients were referred after an incomplete resection. One patient presented with cerebral metastasis. We performed a complete resection in all patients: wedge resection (n = 7), lobectomy (n = 6), sleeve arterial lobectomy (n = 1), lobectomy with thoracic inlet exenteration (n = 2), bilobectomy (n = 2), pneumonectomy with brain metastasectomy (n = 1), sleeve pneumonectomy (n = 2), <b>sleeve</b> <b>main</b> bronchus or tracheal resection (n = 2), wedge with <b>sleeve</b> <b>main</b> pulmonary artery resections (n = 1), and sleeve pneumonectomy with esophageal, aortic arch, and right pulmonary artery resection (n = 1). No adjuvant therapy was given to any patients. Postoperative 30 -day mortality and morbidity rates were 4 % and 8 %, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 80 months (range 4 – 369 months, 100 % follow-up), actuarial 10 -year survival was 89 %. One patient died of an extensive sarcomatous recurrence 2 years after surgery. ConclusionPulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor is a malignant disease affecting young patients with local invasion, distant metastasis, local recurrence, and sarcomatous degeneration. A complete resection should always be performed at initial presentation because of its high likelihood of cure with aggressive management...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} new {{surgical}} technique âScleral Sleeve Methodâ which {{would reduce the}} risk of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) tube related complications in patients undergoing AGV FP 7 (New World Medical Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) for refractory glaucoma. Design: Prospective, Non-Randomized, hospital based interventional case series. Subjects: A total of 16 eyes of adult patients (10 males and 6 females) with refractory glaucoma. Methods: Instead of using sutures to fix the AGV tube to sclera, we devised a novel method of intra-scleral tube fixation by creating a scleral tunnel fashioned in form of <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measure: Post-operative tube related complications. Result: There were no tube related complications such as exposure, extrusion or retraction in any of the cases. Conclusion: Use of scleral sleeve method for tube fixation, along with graft to cover the tube, will provide additional safety measure and reduce the risks of tube related complications.

50|$|There {{are three}} <b>main</b> types of <b>sleeve</b> valves: inline, angle pattern and {{downflow}} pattern. Inline sleeve valve {{can be installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. Inline sleeve valve have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The angle pattern sleeve valve is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. Angle pattern sleeve valves employ a similar design as the inline sleeve valve by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. Downflow pattern sleeve valves are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, stilling wells or tanks. Unlike inline and angle pattern the discharge of a downflow pattern is outward and is not contained by the valve itself.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} analysis of wall thickness of medical balloons and tubing of all sizes using a revolutionary white light interferometry system. Measurements can be taken at all critical dimensions of medical balloons including the balloon <b>sleeves,</b> <b>main</b> balloon body, the shoulder or cone. For main body and tube thickness, values are given for both top and bottom walls, outside and inside diameter. In operation, infrared light (1310 nm) is directed through a measurement probe via optical fiber to the material to be measured. At each juncture of refractive index, some portion of the transmitted light will be reflected back into the probe and some portion will continue through the material. In {{the case of a}} catheter, some IR energy will be reflected back to the device at the top and bottom surfaces of the tubing walls, generating measurements of not only the thickness of the walls themselves, but also the inside diameter distance between the walls. Accurate measurements can be obtained from almost any flat or formed material that allows passage of 1310 nm infrared light. Glass, plastic, silicone, or molded parts that are clear, translucent, dyed, and possibly opaque are good candidates for this measurement approach. This presentation will illustrate advances in measurement of thinner materials than previously reported and discuss measurement of various medical and industrial components such as silicone implants, medical adhesives, capillary flow cells, and medical liquid (blood, saline, etc.) handling bags that can benefit from this new technology. There will be discussion of Research & Development, Quality Assurance, and online process monitoring and control applications. 2...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intermittent {{pneumatic}} compression (IPC) improves haemodynamics in {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD), but {{its effects}} on foot perfusion were scarcely studied. In severe PAD patients we measured the foot oxygenation changes evoked by a novel intermittent IPC device (GP), haemodynamics and compliance to the treatment. Reference values were obtained by a sequential foot-calf device (SFC). METHODS: Twenty ischemic limbs (Ankle-Brachial Index = 0. 5 +/- 0. 2) of 12 PAD patients (7 male, age: 74. 5 +/- 10. 8 y) with an interval of 48 +/- 2 hours received a 35 minute treatment in supine position with two IPC devices: i) a Gradient Pump (GP), which slowly inflates a single thigh special sleeve and ii) an SFC (ArtAssist(R), ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), which rapidly inflates two foot-calf <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measure: changes of oxygenated haemoglobin at foot (HbO 2 foot) by continuous near-infrared spectroscopy recording and quantified as area-under-curve (AUC) for periods of 5 minutes. Other measures: haemodynamics by echo-colour Doppler (time average velocity (TAV) and blood flow (BF) in the popliteal artery and in the femoral vein), patient compliance by a properly developed form. RESULTS: All patients completed the treatment with GP, 9 with SFC. HbO 2 foot during the working phase, considered as average value of the 5 minutes periods, increased with GP (AUC 458 +/- 600 to 1216 +/- 280) and decreased with SFC (AUC 231 +/- 946 to - 1088 +/- 346), significantly for most periods (P < 0. 05). The GP treatment was associated to significant haemodynamic changes from baseline to end of the treatment (TAV = 10. 2 +/- 3. 3 to 13. 5 +/- 5. 5 cm/sec, P = 0. 004; BF = 452. 0 +/- 187. 2 to 607. 9 +/- 237. 8 ml/sec, P = 0. 0001), not observed with SFC (TAV = 11. 2 +/- 3. 4 to 11. 8 +/- 4. 3 cm/sec; BF = 513. 8 +/- 203. 7 to 505. 9 +/- 166. 5 ml/min, P = n. s.). GP obtained a higher score of patient compliance (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: A novel IPC thigh device, unlike a traditional SFC device, increased foot oxygenation in severe PAD, together with favourable haemodynamic response and high compliance to the treatment under the present experimental conditions...|$|R
