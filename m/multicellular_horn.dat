5000|$|Altec Lansing {{produced}} {{a line of}} professional and high-fidelity audio equipment, starting with a line of horn-based loudspeaker systems. First developed for use in motion picture theaters, these products were touted for their fidelity, efficiency and high sound level capability. Products included [...] "biflex" [...] speakers where frequency range was increased by a flexible [...] "decoupling" [...] of a small center area of the speaker's cone from a larger [...] "woofer" [...] area; the 604-series of coaxial speakers employed a high efficiency compression driver mounted {{to the rear of}} the 604's low-frequency magnet, and exited through a <b>multicellular</b> <b>horn</b> that passed through center of the woofer's cone.|$|E
5000|$|By 1943, a {{prototype}} was rapidly developed with off-the-shelf LMCO components. The LF {{portion of the}} driver was developed by taking the field coil motor from the LMCO 287 compression driver and using it to drive the cone from one of LMCO's 15" [...] LF drivers with a 2" [...] voice coil. Both were mounted on a stamped steel frame. An LMCO 801 field coil compression driver with a 1.75" [...] diaphragm was used as is for HF reproduction and mounted coaxially {{to the back of}} the 287 motor. A horn throat from the 801 penetrated the center of the LF field coil and exited into a small <b>multicellular</b> <b>horn</b> mounted in front of the LF cone. The horn was designed with a cut-off frequency of 900 Hz and the system was set with a crossover frequency of 1200 Hz.|$|E
