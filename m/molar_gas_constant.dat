The constant DA is the diffusion constant of the ion A. The second term reflects the flux due to the electric field, which increases linearly with the electric field; this is a Stokes-Einstein relation applied to electrophoretic mobility. The constants here are the charge valence nA of the ion A (e.g., +1 for K+, +2 for Ca2+ and &minus;1 for Cl&minus;), the temperature T (in kelvins), the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> R, and the faraday F, which is the total charge of a mole of electrons.|$|E

Although the molecules {{in a sample of}} gas have an average kinetic energy (and therefore an average speed) the individual molecules move at various speeds and they stop and change direction according to the law of density measurements and isolation, i.e. they exhibit property of distribution of speeds. Some move fast, others relatively slow. Collisions change individual molecular speeds but the distribution of speeds remains the same. This equation is derived from kinetic theory of gases using Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function. The higher the temperature, the greater the mean velocity will be. This works well for both nearly ideal, atomic gases like helium and for molecular gases like diatomic oxygen. This is because despite the larger internal energy in many molecules (compared to that for an atom), 3RT/2 is still the mean translational kinetic energy.This can also be written in terms of the Boltzmann constant (k) as ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The present paper investigates a {{promising}} avenue for {{the intensification of}} turbulent free convection in square cavities using an adequate selection of binary gas mixtures. seven binary gas mixtures have considered helium (He) as the primary gas component and carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, oxygen, xenon, sulfur hexafluoride, and carbon tetra fluoride the secondary gas components. In the thermodynamic context, the thermo physical properties viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and isobaric heat capacity depend on three quantities: temperature, pressure, and <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> composition. The numerical temperature fields T(x, y) for the seven binary gas mixtures He+CO 2, He+CH 4, He+N 2, He+O 2, He+Xe, He+CF 4 and He+SF 6 are channeled through the allied mean convection coefficient h mix/B varying with the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> composition w in proper w-domain [0, 1]. For the seven binary gas mixtures utilized, the allied mean convection coefficient versus the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> composition w is graphed in congruous diagrams. To begin the analysis, we designated h mix as the convective coefficient of a binary gas mixture. Thereby, hmix is isolated in Eq. (1) {{to allow it to}} vary with the thermo-physical properties viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and isobaric heat capacity. This simple operation produces the adjoin proportionality 2...|$|R

From these data and traceable thermometry we estimate the speed of sound in our sample of helium at TTPW = 273. 16 K and zero pressure to be u 0 = (945710. 45 ± 0. 85) 2 m 2 s− 2 and correspondingly deduce the value R = (8. 314 4743 ± 0. 000 0088) J mol− 1 K− 1 for the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>constant.</b> We estimate the value k = R/NA = (1. 380 650 8 ± 0. 000 0015) × 10 – 23 J K− 1 for the Boltzmann constant using the currently accepted value of the Avogadro constant NA.

40|$|Measurements of {{air density}} {{determined}} gravimetrically and {{by using the}} CIPM- 81 / 91 formula, an equation of state, have a relative deviation of 6. 4 × 10 − 5. This difference {{is consistent with a}} new determination of the mole fraction of argon xAr carried out in 2002 by the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and with recently published results from the LNE. The CIPM equation is based on the molar mass of dry air, which is dependent on the contents of the atmospheric gases, including the concentration of argon. We accept the new argon value as definitive and amend the CIPM- 81 / 91 formula accordingly. The KRISS results also provide a test of certain assumptions concerning the mole fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air. An updated value of the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> R is available and has been incorporated in the CIPM- 2007 equation. In making these changes, we have also calculated the uncertainty of the CIPM- 2007 equation itself in conformance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, which was not the case for previous versions of this equation. The 96 th CIPM meeting has accepted these changes. 1...|$|E
3000|$|Electrochemical area {{measurements}} {{were made on}} Ni and NiCo samples with CV using the [Ru(NH_ 3)_ 6]^ 3 +/[Ru(NH_ 3)_ 6]^ 2 + redox couple. Example measurements {{for a variety of}} scan rates are shown in the inset of Fig.  5, which show the expected current response for a reversible redox reaction [43]. The ruthenium-based probe was chosen because the potential window for the CV experiment generally does not interfere with the deposited film. These area measurements could not be made on the Co samples, however, because the CV measurements did not result in reversible redox behavior and the scans in that potential range affected the structure of the film. The magnitude of the peak cathodic current, I_p, {{as a function of the}} scan rate, v, is shown in Fig.  5 for an example measurement. The electrochemical area, A_ec, of the sample was calculated using the Randles–Sevcik equation, I_p = 0.4463 n F A_ec C ([...] nF/ RT)^ 1 / 2 v^ 1 / 2 D^ 1 / 2, where n = 1 is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction, F is Faraday’s constant, C is the bulk concentration of the analyte, R is the <b>molar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>constant,</b> T is the temperature, and D is the diffusion constant of the analyte [43].

40|$|Procedures {{analogous}} {{to those on}} which a practical pH scale has been based can be used profitably to establish operational acidity scales in certain other amphiprotic and mixed solvent media. A universal pH scale relating proton activity uniformly to the aqueous standard reference state {{is not yet a}} practical possibility, but separate scales for each medium can be achieved and will fulfil most of the requirements. The best choice of unit appears to be pall * or — log (mH. yII), where sH is referred to the standard state in each particular medium s. Data for reference solutions in 50 wt. per cent methanol and in deuterium oxide are given. THE OPERATIONAL pH SCALE The well-recognized difficulty in reconciling a fundamental definition of the pH value with the practical experimental procedures for the routine measurement of acidity has led to the widespread adoption of an operational definition of the pH'- 3 pH (X) — pH (S) = (Ri) /F (1) In this equation, X designates the solution of unknown pH and S the standard reference solution of known or assigned pIT, while E is the electro-motive force of a suitable pH cell consisting of an electrode reversible to hydrogen ions (usually a glass electrode, hydrogen gas electrode, or quin-hydrone electrode) coupled with a suitable reference electrode (commonly calomel-mercury or silver-silver chloride electrode). A bridge composed of a concentrated solution of potassium chloride usually connects the reference electrode with solution X or S when the cell is filled.
