The Control - Feedback Loop {{has been around for}} many years and was the key concept in the {{development}} of many electronic designs such as Phase-Lock Loops. The core of the CFA loop concept was based on a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> that corporate executives and staff can anticipate the operation of systems, processes, products and services they use and create before they are developed.|$|E
50|$|The first railway in Queensland {{started from}} Ipswich, a provincial centre, {{rather than the}} capital Brisbane, because {{it was thought that}} river {{transport}} adequately linked Brisbane and Ipswich and that the <b>major</b> <b>need</b> was to improve transport between Ipswich and the productive Darling Downs agricultural region. Work started in early 1864 and the first section of line, from Ipswich to Grandchester, was opened in 1865, gradually extending to the Darling Downs and eventually further west. Ipswich and Brisbane were linked by rail in 1875.|$|E
50|$|The {{services}} of the village are quite limited, with only the primary school and social club being the main ones, most have been shut down over the years due to there being no <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for them. There was a small general shop which was situated on the main road, opposite the village green. The shop dated back to circa the late 1800s, and shared the building with the Post Office. The shop was closed down in 1995, {{due to the lack}} of business.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{industrial}} and biological monitoring has presented another <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for metal analysis via ICP-MS. Individuals working in plants where exposure to metals is likely and unavoidable, {{such as a}} battery factory, are required by their employer to have their blood or urine analyzed for metal toxicity on a regular basis. This monitoring has become a mandatory practice implemented by OSHA, {{in an effort to}} protect workers from their work environment and ensure proper rotation of work duties (i.e. rotating employees from a high exposure position to a low exposure position).|$|E
50|$|Interest in {{the medical}} field rapidly grew {{over the next few}} years due to the United States Civil War, which {{generated}} a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for health related occupations. As a result, the college was founded and opened as the Homeopathic Medical College of the State of New York on the corner of 20th Street and Third Avenue, near Union Square in Manhattan. In the first semester there were 59 students and 8 professors. The college adopted the name New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1869 and, in 1887, New York Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital.|$|E
50|$|The failed mission {{exposed a}} number of serious design flaws in the Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft, namely its lack of reserve {{propellant}} and electrical power for repeated docking attempts. In addition, the Igla docking system {{was found to be}} in <b>major</b> <b>need</b> of improvement. Since it was impossible to carry out these changes before Salyut 3 finished its operating lifespan, they had to wait for future space stations. The backup spacecraft for the Soyuz 15 mission was placed in storage and later flown as Soyuz 20 despite being past its intended shelf life.|$|E

50|$|San Giorgio a Cremano Station {{was opened}} on the {{original}} Naples - Poggiomarino line, but was unpopular and soon neglected. The station was soon after becoming very dilapidated, and in <b>major</b> <b>need</b> of renovation. However it was improved with the electrification of the network, {{and again in the}} 1990s when major renovations were undertaken. The track area was widened, and a platform on Line 3 was added, with an overpass for access. Despite the improvements, the station is regularly the target for local graffiti artists, whose work on the station ranges from simple tags to elaborate murals.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} <b>major</b> <b>need</b> to collect, {{review and}} {{understand}} the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed about important specialized issues like free speech.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{deprivation}} and economic hopelessness, the largely Christian community are devout churchgoers, with {{no less than}} seven churches.

50|$|The NorthAmerican Sportpony Registry {{began in}} 1997 as a {{division}} of the American Warmblood Registry. There was a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for a North American counterpart for the Warmblood movement taking part in Europe. The sudden demand for horses that were strong and physically inclined to excel in sporting events was very great. In 1997 the American Warmblood Registry opened registrations for ponies, following the European example, enabling breeders to cater to a specific market. In 2003, due to the large volume of ponies registered and seeking registration, the NorthAmerican Sportpony Registry was reopened as an independent organization. It is now a hub for not only the sport pony community, but the pony community in general.|$|E
50|$|The Lions had {{traditionally}} {{played their}} football, soccer, and track games/meets at Armstrong Field. But because Armstrong Field {{was too small}} for the vastly growing school, and because of the nearly yearly flooding of Indian Creek which ran next to it, a new athletic field was a <b>major</b> <b>need.</b> The Linn-Mar Stadium is located where the former transportation offices were, adjacent to the High School.Linn-Mar Stadium was completed in 2010, {{and is one of the}} top athletic centers in Iowa. It has 5,000 seats on the home side, 1,000 visitor seats, state of the art Field-Turf, state of the art press box, video board, regulation soccer field, and a modern track.

5000|$|The {{government}} decided {{to counteract the}} effect of the variability of copper prices by creating the Copper Stabilization Fund, which worked as follows: whenever the price of copper increased, the government would direct a proportion of the increased revenues into the fund; these resources would then be used during those years when the price of copper fell below its [...] "normal" [...] level. This institutional development helped Chile at least partially free itself from the volatility of the copper market. The Copper Stabilization Fund is occasionally tapped into if there is a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for more money. Part of the fund will be used to help pay for reconstruction after the devastating 2010 Chile earthquake.|$|E

5000|$|In {{light of}} the Tory position, Parliament faced growing {{pressure}} from the colonies to open immigration to fulfill its <b>major</b> <b>need,</b> agrarian labor. During the colonial period, many were interested in promoting immigration, including the Crown, proprietors, colonial governments, landowners, and agents, all saw in it a profitable enterprise, since immigration would promote settlement, increase the value of landed holdings, and create a protective barrier for the colonies against Spanish, French, and Indians. Each interested party promoted immigration in their own way. Colonial assemblies soon became active in this work, and remained so throughout the colonial period. [...] In 1740 Parliament responded with a more liberal and enlightened policy that greatly eased and broadened the ability of aliens in the American colonies to become naturalized subjects of Britain.|$|E
50|$|The Chargers, {{who had the}} 15th overall pick, had a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> at {{safety to}} replace Rodney Harrison but passed on the {{opportunity}} to select Polamalu by trading down and getting Sammy Davis and Terrence Kiel. The Steelers quickly made a move to bring Polamalu to their team. The Steelers believed so much that Polamalu could {{have a positive impact}} on their defense that they traded up from the twenty-seventh spot to the sixteenth spot, originally held by the Chiefs. The Steelers traded away the ninety-second and two hundredth overall picks for the rights to switch first-round picks. Essentially, the trade was Polamalu for Larry Johnson, Julian Battle, and Brooks Bollinger (the Bollinger pick was subsequently traded to the Jets in the same draft). He has the distinction of being the only safety ever drafted by the Steelers in the first round of a NFL Draft. Polamalu signed a five-year, $8,275,000 contract.|$|E
