In the finite case this {{problem can be}} solved (albeit slowly) using techniques from algebraic statistics, specifically the computation of elimination ideals and Gröbner bases. A very brief introduction to algebraic statistics is given. Consideration is given to cases where shortcuts to proving/disproving <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> are available...|$|E
40|$|For equation-error autoregressive (EEAR) systems, {{this paper}} proposes an {{identification}} algorithm {{by means of}} the <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> transformation. The basic idea is to eliminate the autoregressive term in the model using the model transformation, to estimate the parameters of the converted system and further to compute the parameter estimates of the original system using the comparative coefficient way and the <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> principle. For comparison, the recursive generalized least squares algorithm is given simply. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is effective and can produce more accurate parameter estimates...|$|E

The notion of <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> {{and the use}} of various diagnostic measures provide effective tools in making such comparisons, particularly when the experimental region is highly constrained. It is demonstrated that the choice of the best fitting model, through variable selection, depends on which mixture component is selected as a slack variable, and {{on the size of the}} fitted model. In addition, the equivalence of two well-known representations of a complete mixture model is shown to be valid. Two numerical examples are presented.

40|$|Microgrids {{comprising}} multiple distributed {{resources are}} being increasingly considered for integration into electricity networks. Considering {{the multiplicity of}} the distributed resources in a single location and distributed nature of such single entities, it is impractical to represent them as detailed models in power system simulations. Hence, it will be attractive for electricity utilities to employ simplified models of microgrids in dynamic studies. This paper proposes a method for representing grid-tied microgrids as simplified generator or load units in such studies. For this purpose, the paper takes an approach in investigating the applicability of modal analysis {{as a tool for}} <b>model</b> <b>equivalencing</b> of grid-tied microgrids with inverter and non-inverter interfaced distributed generators. Validity of the reduced order dynamic equivalents is tested under different operating conditions: power export and import modes, with different load types and fault conditions. Scalability of the <b>model</b> <b>equivalencing</b> approach is demonstrated using a case study developed based on the IEEE 13 -Bus test feeder. Furthermore, the <b>model</b> <b>equivalencing</b> is applied on microgrids in a multi-microgrid environment to validate the methodology. The dynamic model equivalent of the microgrid can be represented as a current source at the point of common coupling while retaining all imperative dynamic characteristics. The proposed methodology is also applicable to distribution network clusters comprising distributed generators...|$|R

40|$|Automated model {{building}} has evolved {{as an important}} subdiscipline of automated deduction over the past decade. One crucial issue in automated {{model building}} is the selection of an appropriate (finite) representation of (in general infinite) models. Quite a few such formalisms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we concentrate on the representation of Herbrand models by ground atoms with ground equations (GAE-models), introduced in [9]. For the actual work with any model representation, efficient algorithms for two decision problems are required, namely: The clause evaluation problem (i. e. : Given a clause C and a representation M of a model, does C evaluate to "true" in this model?) and the <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> problem (i. e. : Given two representations M 1 and M 2, do they represent the same model?). Previously published algorithms for these two problems in case of GAE-models require exponential time. We prove that the clause evaluation problem is indeed intractable (that is, coNP-complete), whereas the <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> problem can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show how our new algorithm for the <b>model</b> <b>equivalence</b> problem {{can be used to}} transform an arbitrary GAE-model into an equivalent one with better computational properties...|$|E
