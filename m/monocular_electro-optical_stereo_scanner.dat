40|$|A new {{approach}} to photogrammetric restitution of 3 -line <b>stereo</b> <b>scanner</b> images is presented for use within the MOMS- 02 and MOMS- 2 P project.

To this end, the trajectory data and the orbit determination parameter covariance matrix are incorporated into the photogrammetric processing, together with associated partial derivatives of the spacecraft position with respect to the epoch state and model parameters. By constraining the adjusted trajectory to the physical laws of orbital motion, the bundle adjustment process is stabilized by a significant reduction of the number of required destimation parameters. The basic algorithms for the incorporation of orbital constraints into the photometric evaluation of <b>stereo</b> <b>scanner</b> images and the resulting benefits are described.

This <b>stereo</b> tweezer or <b>scanner</b> will consist of two pairs of scanning mirrors that move the trapping beam in the plane above the surface. In this thesis the design and the performances of this <b>stereo</b> <b>scanner</b> in one dimension was tested. To implement the scanner, standard galvo scanning mirrors were used as is typically done in confocal scanning microscopy. However, two problems arise {{with the use of}} these galvos. First, the electronic feedback that controls the angle of the mirror, introduces noise in the angle and thus in the position of the trap. As a result, a bump arises in the spectrum of the noise. By tuning the constants of the controller of the galvos, this bump was decreased. Second, the two beams should remain overlapped even when the mirrors are scanning. This was achieved by measuring the difference in angle between the galvos and correcting the angle of one of them using a feedback loop. This method was tested by coupling light that has pasted over both galvos back into a single-mode fiber. If the feedback system works the light should remain coupled in the fiber even when the mirrors are scanning. Remaining fluctuations in the fiber coupling were found to be dominated by movements of the beam orthogonal to the scanning axis...|$|R

The high geometric resolution of PRISM (2. 5 m ground sampling distance at nadir) combined with the medium swath width of 35 km {{has the potential to}} achieve high quality Digital Elevation Models up to 1 : 25. 000 scale topographic maps for various applications. One of the proposed test sites is located near Sanaâ€™a, Yemen, where additionally to the PRISM stereo data also an IKONOS stereo image pair exists, which is used for DEM comparison and performance analysis. The results of this test site are evaluated in cooperation with the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Hannover. The paper gives a report on the generation of digital surface models (DSM) and orthoimages from ALOS/PRISM 3 -line stereo data using DLRâ€™s automated stereo processing chain. Ground control points (GCP) of sufficient accuracy are introduced to increase the geometric accuracy of the derived DSM and orthoimages, but as well as evaluations without using GCP shall demonstrate the pointing performance of the ALOS/PRISM system. After the images are prepared for the processing, a matching is performed between the three images in forward, nadir and backward direction using a hierarchical intensity based matching. Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved by a local least squares matching. Blunder reduction is done by thresholds and bi-directional matching. A densification of the tie points is achieved by a region growing algorithm based on local least squares matching. From the obtained tie points, object space coordinates are derived from two different methods to interpolate a regular grid to create a DSM. For the first method Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC) are generated for the PRISM images. For the second method a rigorous approach is applied using the exterior and interior orientation parameters as input for the forward intersection. Both methods are compared and the applicability of RPC for PRISM is discussed. Finally the resulting DSM is compared to the DSM generated from the IKONOS stereo pair and evaluated regarding horizontal and vertical accuracy by 3 D shift determination between the individual DSM, as well as profile analysis at different terrain steepness. The possible potential of the derived results is demonstrated for an integrated water resource management in Amran (Yemen), where satellite data of sufficient resolution can provide important information of the changing agrarian areas and resultant water supply. Assessment of potential location for water dams can be derived from high quality DEM.

Rapid exhumation of the high-grade metamorphic rocks occurred between 640 and 545 Ma involving extension along a tectonic transition zone. The transition zone is a ductile detachment overprinted by brittle low-angle faulting. Although partly pertaining to a Tertiary deformation related to the opening of the Red Sea, we suggest that this low-angle zone was a detachment surface in the Neoproterozoic that accommodated extension during orogenic collapse to restore normal crustal thickness which wa...|$|R
40|$|MOMS (Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral <b>Stereo</b> <b>Scanner)</b> is a German {{spaceborne}} pushbroom scanner {{for high}} resolution (HR), multispectral (MS) and threefold along-track stereoscopic imaging. The camera was first flown {{on the second}} German Space Shuttle Mission in spring 1993. After the 11 days shuttle mission the camera system was refurbished for a second flight onboard the PRIRODA module of the Russian space station MIR. This mission, called MOMS- 2 P, lasted from May 1996 to August 1999. MOMS- 2 P was equipped with a navigation package consisting of a GPS receiver and two redundant gyro subsystems for obtaining position and attitude data with high accuracy. For the MIR orbit altitude of 400 km the ground pixel size was 18 m and 6 m (HR). The orbit inclination was 51. 6 Â°. The data takes mainly cover Europe, North-East Africa, Middle East and South America, but also selected image strips from other parts {{in the world are}} available. In total approximately 65 Mio. km 2 of the land mass have been recorded. In the meantime a series of MOMS data takes have been evaluated. Accuracy analysis using independent ground control led to point accuracies of better than 10 m in X, Y, Z for test sites in Germany. The geometric calibration was conducted by band to band registration for the multispectral channels and by photogrammetric adjustment using precise ground control for the stereo channels (inverse photogrammetry). The paper decribes the imaging technique of the camera, presents the actual status of data recording and data availability, reports on the applied calibration methods and summarises results of photogrammetric data evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{has more}} than 20 years of history in {{developing}} spaceborne <b>stereo</b> <b>scanners</b> and the corresponding stereo evaluation software systems. It takes part in the CARTOSAT- 1 Scientific Assessment Program (C-SAP) as a principal investigator for German (Southeast Bavaria) and Spanish (Catalonia) test sites and as a Co-I for a French test site (Mausanne-les-Alpilles). A rich variety of landscapes is present in these three test sites. In all cases ground truth in form of GCP (or orthoimages of high resolution) and DTM/DSM (digital terrain or surface models) of sufficient accuracy have been delivered by the principal investigators. Rational polynomial functions (RPC) are provided by the distributing Indian agency (Space Applications Centre (SAC) of ISRO, Ahmedabad) as a universal sensor model for each scene. The inherent absolute orientation accuracy of the RPC models in the CARTOSAT- 1 stereo imagery used here {{turned out to be}} around 100 m (normally). Thus, to exploit the high resolution of 2. 5 m, RPC have to be corrected via the available ground truth. It is shown that the correction by an affine transformation is necessary in order to achieve sub-pixel accuracy in the stereo evaluation of full scenes. The remaining standard deviations of the residuals in image space during RPC correction are about 0. 5 - 1 pixel in ground control points (GCP). Stereo evaluation is done by DLR processing software. Hierarchical intensity based matching and subsequent region growing are used to automatically derive a dense set of stereo tie points. An effective blunder reduction is based upon bidirectional LSM, quasi-epipolar reprojection of the tie points, and control of residuals in stereo forward intersection. Shifts between aft/fore orthoimages are found to be in sub-pixel range. DSM accuracy assessment is done via the statistics of height difference...|$|R
