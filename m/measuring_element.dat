25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic flow meters, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "mag meters", are technically a velocity-type water meter, except that they use electromagnetic properties to determine the water flow velocity, rather than the mechanical means used by jet and turbine meters. Mag meters use the physics principle of Faraday's law of induction for measurement, and require AC or DC electricity from a power line or battery to operate the electromagnets. Since mag meters have no mechanical <b>measuring</b> <b>element,</b> they normally have the advantage of being able to measure flow in either direction, and use electronics for measuring and totalizing the flow. Mag meters can also be useful for measuring raw (untreated/unfiltered) water and waste-water, since there is no mechanical <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> to get clogged or damaged by debris flowing through the meter. Strainers are not required with mag meters, since there is no <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> in the stream of flow that could be damaged. Since stray electrical energy flowing through the flow tube can cause inaccurate readings, most mag meters are installed with either grounding rings or grounding electrodes to divert stray electricity away from the electrodes used to measure the flow inside the flow tube.|$|E
50|$|As in any moving-coil indicator, {{rotation}} of the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> is produced by forces which are proportional to product of the current and field strength,and the direction of rotation depends on the direction of current relative to the magnetic field. In a ratio meter, therefore, {{it follows that the}} force produced by one coil will always tend to rotate the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> in the opposite direction to the force produced by the second coil,and further more,as the magnetic field is of non-uniform strength,the coil carrying the greater current will always move towards the area of weaker field, and vice versa. When the temperature at the sensing element Rx increases, then in accordance with the temperature/resistance relation ship of the material used for the element, its resistance will increase and so cause a decrease in the force created by it.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with a significant number of technologies is that they are installed through a nozzle and are exposed to products. This can create several problems, especially when retrofitting new equipment to vessels that have already been stress relieved, as it may not be possible to fit the instrument at the location required. Also, as the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> is exposed to the contents within the vessel, it may either attack or coat the instrument causing it to fail in service. One of the most reliable methods for measuring level is using a Nuclear gauge, as it is installed outside the vessel and doesn't normally require a nozzle for bulk level measurement. The <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> is installed outside the process and can be maintained in normal operation without taking a shutdown. Shutdown is only required for an accurate calibration.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{registers}} on water meters. A standard register normally has a dial similar to a clock, with gradations around the perimeter to indicate the measuring unit {{and the amount of}} water used, if less than the lowest digit in a display similar to the odometer wheels in a car, their sum being the total volume used. Modern registers are normally driven by a magnetic coupling between a magnet in the measuring chamber attached to the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> and another attached {{to the bottom of the}} register. Gears in the register convert the motion of the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> to the proper usage increment for display on the sweep hand and the odometer-style wheels. Many registers also have a leak detector. This is a small visible disk or hand that is geared closer to the rotation speed of the drive magnet, so that very small flows that would be visually undetectable on the regular sweep hand can be seen.|$|E

5000|$|Theoretically, {{the intent}} of box {{counting}} is to quantify fractal scaling, but from a practical perspective this would require that the scaling be known ahead of time. This {{can be seen in}} Figure 1 where choosing boxes of the right relative sizes readily shows how the pattern repeats itself at smaller scales. In fractal analysis, however, the scaling factor is not always known ahead of time, so box counting algorithms attempt to find an optimized way of cutting a pattern up that will reveal the scaling factor. The fundamental method for doing this starts with a set of measuring elementsâboxesâconsisting of an arbitrary number, called [...] here for convenience, of sizes or calibres, which we will call the set of s. Then these -sized boxes are applied to the pattern and counted. To do this, for each [...] in , a <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> that is typically a 2-dimensional square or 3-dimensional box with side length corresponding to [...] is used to scan a pattern or data set (e.g., an image or object) according to a predetermined scanning plan to cover the relevant part of the data set, recording, i.e.,counting, for each step in the scan relevant features captured within the <b>measuring</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E

50|$|A leak-down tester is {{essentially}} a miniature flow meter similar in concept to an air flow bench. The <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> is the restriction orifice and the leakage in the engine is compared to the flow of this orifice. There will be a pressure drop across the orifice and another across any points of leakage in the engine. Since the meter and engine are connected in series, the flow is the same across both. (For example: If the meter was unconnected {{so that all the}} air escapes then the reading would be 0, or 100% leakage. Conversely, if there is no leakage there will be no pressure drop across either the orifice or the leak, giving a reading of 100, or 0% leakage).|$|E
50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} power at microwave frequencies. In this application, a resistive element is exposed to microwave power. A dc bias current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via Joule heating, such that the resistance is matched to the waveguide characteristic impedance. After applying microwave power, the bias current is reduced to return the bolometer to its resistance in the absence of microwave power. The change in the dc power is then equal to the absorbed microwave power. To reject the effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (<b>measuring)</b> <b>element</b> is in a bridge circuit with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient measurement of the power of a pulsed source.|$|E
