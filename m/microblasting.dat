40|$|This {{investigation}} {{evaluated the}} effect of different surface treatment of the tooth ridge lap surface {{on the strength of}} the tooth/denture base interfacial bonding. The surface treatment regimens investigated were: <b>microblasting,</b> coating with a solventbased adhesive and a combined <b>microblasting</b> and adhesive coating of the ridge lap surface. All tests were conducted according to the ADA specification No. 15. The data were analyzed statistically using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test. A value of p < 0. 01 was considered significant. Roughening the tooth ridge lap surface by <b>microblasting</b> resulted in significantly stronger bonding to denture base than untreated ridge lap surface (p = 0. 001). Adhesive-coating the ridge lap surface did not promote bonding significantly compared with the untreated tooth surface (p = 0. 500). The combination treatment did improve bonding (p = 0. 007) but was significantly less compared with roughening the ridge lap only. Of the three evaluated surface treatment regimens, <b>microblasting</b> the tooth ridge lap surface seemed to have a major and significant contribution to establishing a satisfactory interfacial bonding...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} microrobotized blasting of titanium endosteal implants relative to their manually blasted counterparts. Two different implant systems were utilized presenting two different implant surfaces. Control surfaces (Manual) were fabricated by manually grit blasting the implant surfaces while experimental surfaces (<b>Microblasted)</b> were fabricated through a microrobotized system that provided a one pass grit blasting routine. Both surfaces were created with the same similar to 50 gm average particle size alumina powder at similar to 310 KPa. Surfaces were then etched with 37 % HCl for 20 min, washed, and packaged through standard industry procedures. The surfaces were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical interferometry, and were then placed in a beagle dog radius model remaining in vivo for 3 and 6 weeks. The implant removal torque was recorded and statistical analysis evaluated implant system and surface type torque levels {{as a function of}} time in vivo. Histologic sections were qualitatively evaluated for tissue response. Electron microscopy depicted textured surfaces for both manual and <b>microblasted</b> surfaces. Optical interferometry showed significantly higher S-a, S-q, values for the <b>microblasted</b> surface and no significant difference for S-ds and S-dr values between surfaces. In vivo results depicted that statistically significant gains in biomechanical fixation were obtained for both implant systems tested at 6 weeks in vivo, while only one system presented significant biomechanical gain at 3 weeks. Histologic sections showed qualitative higher amounts of new bone forming around <b>microblasted</b> implants relative to the manually blasted group. Microrobotized blasting resulted in higher biomechanical fixation of endosteal dental implants and should be considered as an alternative for impant surface manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{coating of}} hard tissue {{implants}} is widely employed for its biocompatible and osteoconductive properties {{as well as}} its improved mechanical properties. Plasma technology is the principal deposition process for coating HA on bioactive metals for this application. However, thermal decomposition of HA can occur during the plasma deposition process, resulting in coating variability in terms of purity, uniformity and crystallinity, which can lead to implant failure caused by aseptic loosening. In this study, CoBlastTM, a novel blasting process has been used to successfully modify a titanium (V) substrate with a HA treatment using a dopant/abrasive regime. The impact of a series of apatitic abrasives under the trade name MCD, was investigated to determine the effect of abrasive particle size on the surface properties of both <b>microblast</b> (abrasive only) and CoBlast (HA/abrasive) treatments. The resultant HA treated substrates were compared to substrates treated with abrasive only (<b>microblasted)</b> and an untreated Ti. The HA powder, apatitic abrasives and the treated substrates were characterized for chemical composition, coating coverage, crystallinity and topography including surface roughness. The results show that the surface roughness of the HA blasted modification was affected by the particle size of the apatitic abrasives used. The CoBlast process did not alter the chemistry of the crystalline HA during deposition. Cell proliferation on the HA surface was also assessed, which demonstrated enhanced osteo-viability compared to the <b>microblast</b> and blank Ti. This study demonstrates the ability of the CoBlast process to deposit HA coatings with a range of surface properties onto Ti substrates. The ability of the CoBlast technology to offer diversity in modifying surface topography offers exciting new prospects in tailoring the properties of medical devices for applications ranging from dental to orthopedic settings...|$|R

40|$|Micron thick {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO 2) coatings exhibiting a nano-structured, anatase, meso-porous structure were successfully deposited across {{a range of}} polymer, conductive glass and metallic substrates at low velocities using a <b>microblasting</b> technique. This process was conducted at atmospheric pressure using compressed air as the carrier gas and commercially available agglomerated nano particles of TiO 2 as the feedstock. An examination of the effect of impact kinetics on the agglomerated powder before and after deposition was undertaken. A further examination of the coating microstructure along with photocurrent density measurements before and after thermal treatments was explored. Owing to the low temperature and velocity of the powder during deposition no change in phase of the powder or damage to the substrate was observed. The resulting TiO 2 coatings exhibited relatively good adhesion on both titanium and FTO coated glass substrates with coating thickness of approximately 1. 5 μm. Photo-catalytic performance was measured under solar simulator illumination using a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC) with a 5 -fold increase in performance observed after thermal treatment of the TiO 2 coated substrates. <b>Microblasting</b> was demonstrated to be a rapid and cost effective method for the deposition of nano-structured, photo-catalytic, anatase TiO 2 coatings...|$|E

Such surface modifications are aimed to improve early healing response and, clinically, offer the possibility to shorten the time from implant placement to functional loading. Since FAK and Src are intracellular proteins able to predict the quality of osteoblast adhesion, this study evaluated the osteoblast behavior in response to nanometer scale titanium surface texturing by monitoring FAK and Src phosphorylations. Four engineered titanium surfaces were used for the study: machined (M), dual acid-etched (DAA), resorbable media <b>microblasted</b> and acid-etched (MBAA), and acid-etch <b>microblasted</b> (AAMB). Surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, interferometry, atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

Both Src and FAK were investigated by using specific antibody against specific phosphorylation sites. The results showed that both FAK and Src activations were differently modulated as a function of titanium surfaces physico/chemical configuration and protein adsorption. It can be suggested that signaling pathways involving both FAK and Src could provide biomarkers to predict osteoblast adhesion onto different surfaces...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Modifications in implant surface {{topography}} {{and chemistry}} may alter the early bone response at different levels. This study characterized four implant surfaces and evaluated the biomechanical fixation and histologic response at early implantation {{times in a}} canine radius model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: External-hexagon Branemark-type implants were used with four experimental surfaces: <b>microblasted</b> (MI), acid-etched and <b>microblasted</b> (AAM), anodized (A), and discrete crystalline deposition (DCD). Surface topography was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, interferometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The implants {{were placed in the}} central region of the radii of eight beagle dogs and remained in vivo for 10 or 30 days. The implants were torqued to interface failure, and a general linear statistical model with torque as the dependent variable and implant surface and time in vivo as independent variables was used. RESULTS: All surfaces presented were textured, and different surface chemistries were observed. No significant differences between implant surfaces were observed for torque at 10 days. However, at 30 days, the AAM surface presented significantly higher torque values compared to the DCD and A surfaces. Significantly higher torque values were observed at 30 days compared to 10 days (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Significantly different biomechanical fixation dependent on surface preparation was observed after 30 days, and all surfaces were biocompatible and osteoconductive...|$|R

40|$|In the {{described}} investigations, nano-impact {{tests were}} conducted on PVD film surfaces previously subjected to micro-blasting at different pressures for constant duration. <b>Microblasting</b> improves the film mechanical properties due to the induced residual compressive stresses into the coating structure. The film mechanical properties {{as well as the}} ratio of the film yield to rupture stress (SY/SM) grow up to a certain micro-blasting pressure. The augmentation of Sy/Sm ratio increases simultaneously the film brittleness. For analyzing the effect of the SY/SM ratio on the film brittleness, a multi-layer 3 D-FEM model simulating the nano-impact test was developed employing the LS-DYNA software package. The FEM calculated results converge sufficiently with the attained, experimental ones. Based on these results, the film's failure initiation and evolution can be predicted depending on the SY/SM ratio of the individual film layers...|$|E
40|$|Micro-blasting on PVD coated tools is an {{effective}} technology for improving their cutting performance. Through micro-blasting, compressive stresses are induced into the film, thus increasing the coating hardness, but its brittleness too. Simultaneously, abrasion phenomena are activated, which may lead to roughness augmentation, film thickness decrease and substrate revelation. In this way, for a successful process conduct, it is pivotal to adapt, among others, the applied micro-blasting pressure to the employed medium, air or water. The paper deals with the optimization of wet or dry micro-blasting pressure by various Al 2 O 3 grain sizes for improving the coated tool’s wear resistance. The wear behaviour of coated and variously dry or wet micro-blasted tools was investigated in milling. Considering the grains’ penetration kinematics into the coated tool surface and the film deformation mechanisms during dry or wet <b>microblasting</b> by fine or coarse sharp–edged Al 2 O 3 grains, optimum process pressures can be determined...|$|E

Cutting test results show that blades which had undergone a <b>microblasting</b> process exhibited an increase in tool life. Using testing methods developed to simulate the cutting action of full circular saw blades by using representative saw segments, the effects of substrate surface preparation are further investigated by identifying and comparing the wear mechanisms that develop on circular saw teeth subject to various preparation/coating conditions. Assessment of the wear and failure mechanisms associated with each combination of substrate preparation/coating have been used to appraise the relative merits of the treatment, blade design and manufacturing process.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Si addition on a nanometer-scale roughness Ca and P implant surfaces in a canine tibia model by biomechanical and histomorphometric evaluations. Material and methods: The implant surfaces comprised a resorbable media CaP <b>microblasted</b> (control) and a CaP resorbable media + silica-boost <b>microblasted</b> (experimental) surfaces. Surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and optical interferometry (IFM) down to the nanometric level. The animal model involved the bilateral placement of control (n = 24) and experimental surface (n = 24) implants along the proximal tibiae of six dogs, remaining in vivo for 2 or 4 weeks. After euthanization, half of the specimens were torquedto- interface failure, {{and the other half}} was subjected to histomorphologic and bone-to-implant contact (BIC) evaluation. Torque and BIC statistical evaluation was performed by the Friedman test at 95 % level of significance, and comparisons between groups was performed by the Dunn test. Results: IFM and SEM observations depicted comparable roughness parameters for both implant surfaces on the micrometer and nanometer scales. XPS analysis revealed similar chemical composition, except for the addition of Si on the experimental group. Torque-to-interface failure and BIC mean values showed no significant differences (P = 0. 25 and 0. 51, respectively) at both 2 - and 4 -week evaluation points for experimental and control groups. Early bone healing histomorphologic events were similar between groups. Conclusions: The experimental surface resulted in not significantly different biomechanical fixation and BIC relative to control. Both surfaces were biocompatible and osseoconductive.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess histologically and histomorphometrically the early bone forming {{properties}} after 3 weeks for 2 commercially available implants, one supposedly possessing nanotopography and one without, in a rabbit femur model. Twenty-four implants divided equally into 2 groups were utilized in this study. The first group (P-I MICRO+NANO) was a titanium oxide (TiO 2) <b>microblasted</b> and noble gas ion bombarded surface while the second group (Ospol) was anodic oxidized surface with calcium and phosphate incorporation. The implants were placed in the rabbit femur unicortically and were allowed to heal for 3 weeks. After euthanasia, the samples were subjected to histologic sectioning and bone-implant contact and bone area were evaluated histomorphometrically under an optical microscope. The histomorphometric evaluation presented that the P-I MICRO+NANO implants demonstrated significantly higher new bone formation as compared to the Ospol implants. Within the limitations of this study, the results suggested that nanostructures presented significantly higher bone formation after 3 weeks in vivo, and the effect of chemistry was limited, which is indicative that nanotopography is effective at early healing periods...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} immune response of V beta 8 + T cells to the bacterial superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B was compared in BALB/c mice. Secondary responder T cells were found to up-regulate {{the expression of the}} adhesion molecule LFA- 1 faster, and to enter the cell cycle earlier than primary responder T cells. Both, {{primary and secondary}} responder T cells upregulate the expression of CD 2 and CD 25 and turn into blast cells with superimposable time kinetics. Secondary responder T cells terminate DNA synthesis, blast formation and the upregulation of CD 25 and CD 2 expression earlier than primary responder T cells and become more rapidly deleted. Two days after superantigen challenge, when primary responder T cells reach peak activity in terms of DNA synthesis and blast formation, secondary responder T cells have returned to the size of <b>microblasts</b> and ceased to replicate their DNA. Whereas our results are consistent with the observations leading to the concept of superantigen-induced T-cell anergy, they demonstrate, by revealing the accelerated vigorous secondary T-cell response to the superantigen, that this concept requires reconsideration...|$|R
40|$|The facades of the Bank of Greece {{historic}} building, mainly {{consisted of}} porous stone, gray marble and white pentelic marble, {{are subjected to}} an intensive air pollution attack {{in the center of}} Athens. A diagnostic study was carried out prior to the cleaning procedures for the weathering evaluation. Weathering appears mainly as black depositions, salt crusts, and oily depositions, due to the heavily polluted urban atmosphere from the nearby traffic, Previous improper cleaning treatment by water spray under high pressure caused detachment of grains and fissuring which were recognized as mechanical abrasion of the surfaces. In this study, a pilot investigation is performed with the intention of evaluating the most appropriate cleaning treatment. Therefore, several cleaning procedures were performed in the laboratory and in situ for the evaluation of methods and products applied on the facades. Both chemical and physical cleaning procedures were applied and they were chosen for their selective action: only water and sepiolite for solvent action, ammonium bicarbonate for exchange action, EDTA for the chemical chelating action and <b>microblasting</b> for physical action were used, In situ non-destructive evaluation was performed by Fiber Optics Microscopy in order to assess the counteractions of each cleaning method to the original surfaces.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} a novel {{powder coating}} processing technique (<b>microblasting)</b> for the fabrication of nickel oxide (NiOx) coatings is reported. ~ 1. 2 μm thick NiOx coatings are deposited at 20 mm 2 s− 1 by the bombardment of the NiOx powder onto a Ni sheet using an air jet {{at a speed}} of more than 180 m s− 1. Microblast deposited NiOx coatings can be prepared at a high processing rate, do not need further thermal treatment. Therefore, this scalable method is time and energy efficient. The mechano-chemical bonding between the powder particles and substrate results {{in the formation of}} strongly adherent NiOx coatings. Microstructural analyses were carried out using SEM, the chemical composition and coatings orientation were determined by XPS and XRD, respectively. The electroactivity of the microblast deposited NiOx coatings was compared with that of NiOx coatings obtained by sintering NiOx nanoparticles previously sprayed onto Ni sheets. In the absence of a redox mediator in the electrolyte, the reduction current of microblast deposited NiOx coatings, when analyzed in anhydrous environment, was two times larger than that produced by higher porosity NiOx nanoparticles coatings of the same thickness obtained through spray coating followed by sintering. Under analogous experimental conditions thin layers of NiOx obtained by using the sol–gel method, ultrasonic spray- and electro-deposition show generally lower current density with respect to microblast samples of the same thickness. The electrochemical reduction of NiOx coatings is controlled by the bulk characteristics of the oxide and the relatively ordered structure of microblast NiOx coatings with respect to sintered NiOx nanoparticles here considered, is expected to increase the electron mobility and ionic charge diffusion lengths in the microblast samples. Finally, the increased level of adhesion of the microblast film on the metallic substrate affords a good electrical contact at the metal/metal oxide interface, and constitutes another reason in support of the choice of microblast as low-cost and scalable deposition method for oxide layers to be employed in electrochemical applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the {{response}} of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings, fabricated using two deposition technologies, to immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). The deposition methods used were: plasma spray, a commercial standard, and CoBlast, a novel low temperature <b>microblast</b> technique. In {{the case of the}} latter, HA coatings are deposited by simultaneous blasting HA and abrasive powders concentrically at a metallic substrate, resulting in a thin layer of HA (approx. 2. 5 µm thick). Groups of the CoBlast and plasma spray HA coatings were immersed in 7 ml of SBF solution for 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days, and were subsequently removed and examined for any alterations caused by the SBF solution. It was noted from this study that the CoBlast HA coatings appeared to undergo a two step calcium phosphate recrystallisation process; initial homogenous nucleation and subsequent heterogeneous nucleation. Conversely recrystallisation on the plasma spray coatings appeared to proceed largely through a heterogeneous nucleation process. Two factors that may influence the differences in HA recrystallisation is the presence of amorphous HA resulting in rapid dissolution, and/or the significantly lower surface area (roughness) offered to the SBF solution by the CoBlast coatings. The interpretation of recrystallisation mechanisms from this preliminary study is limited however by the differences in coating morphology and thickness (27 versus 2 µm) for the plasma spray and CoBlast HA coatings respectively...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{deposition}} process named CoBlastTM, based on grit blasting technology, {{has been used}} to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA) onto titanium (Ti) metal using a dopant/abrasive regime. The various powders (HA powder, apatitic abrasives) and the treated substrates were characterised for chemical composition, coating coverage, crystallinity and topography including surface roughness. The surface roughness of the HA surfaces could be altered using apatitic abrasives of different particle sizes. Compared to the standard plasma spraying process, the CoBlast surface produced excellent coating adhesion, lower dissolution, higher levels of mechanical and chemical stability in stimulated body fluid (SBF). Enhanced viability of osteoblastic cells was also observed on the CoBlast HA surfaces compared to the <b>microblast</b> and untreated Ti as well as the plasma HA coating. CoBlast offers an alternative to the traditional methods of coating HA implants with added versatility. Apatites substituted with antimicrobial metals can also be deposited to add functionality to HA coatings without cytotoxicty. The potential use of these coatings as an infection preventing strategy for application on hard tissue implants was assessed in vitro and also in vivo. Surface physicochemical properties and morphology were determined in addition to surface cytocompatibility assessments using a MG- 63 osteoblast cell line. The antibacterial potential of the immobilised metal ion on the surface and the eluted ion to a lesser extent, contributed to the anticolonising behaviour of the surfaces against a standard bacteria strain (S. aureus) {{as well as a number}} of clinically relevant strains (MRSA, MSSA and S. epidermis). The results revealed that the surfaces coated with silver substituted apatites (AgA) outperformed the other apatites examined (apatites loaded with Zn, Sr and both Ag and Sr ions). Assessment of bacterial adherence on coated K-wires following subcutaneous implantation in a nude mouse infection model (S. aureus) for two days demonstrated that the 12 % wt surface outperformed the 5 % wt AgA coating. Lower inflammatory responses were activated with the insertion of the Ag loaded K-wires with a localised infection at the implantation site noted over the two day study period. These results indicated that the AgA coating on the surface of orthopaedic implants demonstrate good biocompatibility whilst inhibiting bacterial adhesion and colonising of the implant surface...|$|R
