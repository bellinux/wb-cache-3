50|$|All {{models have}} one train, which has 10 cars with 2 seats on each car. This caters {{for up to}} 650 riders per hour. All of the models feature lift hills powered by tires and <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> runs.|$|E
50|$|The launch track {{features}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> fins. These {{slow down}} the car if the launch is unsuccessful (also known as a rollback). Storm Runner {{does not have a}} very tall top hat like Top Thrill Dragster and Kingda Ka, and usually does not have a problem clearing it. After a successful (although slightly rocky) first season, the ride's launch system is generally considered reliable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the <b>brakes,</b> the <b>magnetic</b> field created by the brakes slows the train. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> are a {{relatively}} new technology that are beginning to gain popularity due to their high degree of safety. Rather than slowing a train via friction (such as fin or skid brakes), which can often be affected by various elements such as rain, <b>magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> rely completely on certain magnetic properties and resistance. In fact, <b>magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> never {{come in contact with}} the train.|$|R

50|$|Fiorano GT Challenge is a steel dueling {{roller coaster}} at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The roller coaster {{features}} two, 1.08 km tracks, {{each of which}} has four LSM launches and four <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> sections, immersing passengers into the twisting, head-to-head varying speeds and accelerations of GT racing. Power for the ride system is provided via two flywheel motor generator sets, isolating the surge requirements of the launches from the electrical grid. The trains' 3 cars have been modeled after the styling of Ferrari F430 Spiders.|$|E
50|$|The ride has one train, {{which has}} 10 cars with 2 seats on each car {{catering}} 650 riders per hour. The safety system consists of over-the-shoulder restraints that lock {{into place and}} then a belt-type connector that attaches the seat base to the over-the-shoulder restraints. Riders are taken up 14.8 m by a wheeled lift hill, and go through a tight helix, followed {{by a series of}} small turns and drops. Upon approaching the station, the ride is slowed by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> run. Each ride cycle takes 1.5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, a train {{will not}} attain enough speed {{to make it}} over the initial 205 ft top hat element. Instead, the train will {{partially}} ascend the tower, stall, and then roll back into <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> fins situated on the launch track. This {{is known as a}} rollback, and is part of the normal design of the ride. A rollback can cause Xcelerator to close for an indefinite amount of time while the ride is reset and a sufficient number of test launches are performed. Rain, weight, frequency of launching, outside temperature, and overheating can contribute to a rollback.|$|E

5000|$|The linear {{eddy current}} brake {{consists}} of a magnetic yoke with electrical coils positioned along the rail, which are being magnetized alternating as south and north magnetic poles. This magnet does not touch the rail, but is held at a constant small distance from the rail of approximately 7 mm (the {{eddy current brake}} {{should not be confused}} with another device, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake,</b> in wide use in railways, which exerts its braking force by friction of a brake shoe with the rail). It works the same as a disk eddy current brake, by inducing closed loops of eddy current in the conductive rail, which generate counter magnetic fields which oppose the motion of the train.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movement}} uses a mainspring as {{a source}} of energy and transmits it through gear train just like a traditional mechanical watch, but instead of an escapement and balance wheel, Seiko used the newly developed [...] "Tri-synchro regulator", which acts like a quartz movement. The Tri-synchro regulator has three main function: controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring, generate electricity for the low consumption (~25 nanowatts) quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel. By replacing the traditional escapement with <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake,</b> the Spring Drive operates with lower noise and present a glide motion hand that shows continuous flow of time. The Spring Drive movement was also used {{as the basis for the}} first ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk, the aptly named Seiko Spring Drive Spacewalk.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of magnetic brakes {{is that they}} cannot completely stop a train, and as such cannot be used as block brakes. They also cannot be conventionally disengaged like other types of brakes. Instead, the fins or magnets must be retracted so that the fins no longer pass between the magnets. Accelerator Coasters, for example, {{have a series of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> fins located on the launch track. When the train is launched, the brakes are retracted to allow the train to reach its full speed. After the train is launched, the brake fins are raised to safely slow the train down {{in the event of a}} rollback. This is currently in place at the Top Thrill Dragster of Cedar Point and Kingda Ka of Six Flags Great Adventure, where magnets on the track lower during launch and raise to slow the train in such event.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic fields at {{the surface}} of a few early-type stars have been {{directly}} detected. These fields have magnitudes between a few hundred G up to a few kG. In one case, evidence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> has been found. We investigate the effects of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> on the evolution of rotating (Ï…_ ini= 200 km s^- 1) 10 M_ stellar models at solar metallicity during the main-sequence (MS) phase. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> process is included in our stellar models according to the formalism deduced from 2 D MHD simulations of magnetic wind confinement by ud-Doula and co-workers. Various assumptions are made regarding both the magnitude of the magnetic field and of the efficiency of the angular momentum transport mechanisms in the stellar interior. When <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> occurs in models with differential rotation, a strong and rapid mixing is obtained {{at the surface}} accompanied by a rapid decrease in the surface velocity. Such a process might account for some MS stars showing strong mixing and low surface velocities. When solid-body rotation is imposed in the interior, the star is slowed down so rapidly that surface enrichments are smaller than in similar models with no <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> In both kinds of models (differentially or uniformly rotating), <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> due to a field of a few 100 G significantly reduces the angular momentum of the core during the MS phase. This reduction is much greater in solid-body rotating models. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication as a Letter in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
40|$|A non-ideal MHD {{collapse}} calculation {{employing the}} axisymmetric thin-disk approximation {{is used to}} resolve cloud core collapse down to the scales of the second (stellar) core. Rotation and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{are included in the}} model, and the partial ionization resulting in ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation is calculated from a detailed chemical network. We find that a centrifugal disk can indeed form in the earliest stage of star formation, due to a shut-off of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> caused by <b>magnetic</b> field diffusion in the first core region. Thus, there is no catastrophic <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> in a model with realistic non-ideal MHD. Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure, conference proceedings for APRIM 2011, S. Komonjinda, Y.

50|$|As it {{exits the}} tunnel, the train gains speed veering right, then taking another hard {{turn to the}} right. The track goes downhill, then rises uphill and hits a trim brake. The train then goes down a gradual descent and climbs the second lift hill. At {{the top of this}} lift, the train turns left and begins a gradual, 18-degree drop. The drop itself {{measures}} 141 ft from the crest of the lift hill to the lowest point of the helix. As the train descends, the track starts to bank left in preparation for entrance into the final helix. The highly banked, high speed, counter clockwise helix is the signature trademark of the ride. Half of this massive double helix is enclosed, which adds to the intensity and excitement. Once through this element, the train crests another small hill, then rises into the final <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> run back to the station.|$|E
50|$|The {{team was}} founded by David Chew Vee Kuan with his faculty advisor, Prof Yoshiaki Ohkami, to build a team of four {{students}} to submit a preliminary design to SpaceX for review.The team proposed the vision of Hyperloop System in connecting satellite cities with major cities of distance more than 500 km but able to travel at speed of plane and at the convenience of a train. People able {{to move from the}} place they live and the place they work where could be 500 km apart but only 30minutes away. The team proposed a pod design using Magnetic Levitation, Light Vacuum Tolerant Vehicle System, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Brake</b> System and Safety System Architecture in their design proposal.Following review of the high-level design, the team was invited to the Design Weekend at Texas A&M University on 29-30 January 2016 to present their ideas and design to panel of judges along with other 120 teams.Keio Alpha Hyperloop Team was selected as one of the 30 finalist teams to build, and then race, their pod in the prototype vacuum tube test track adjacent to Space X Headquarters at Hawthorne, (Los Angeles) California, USA.|$|E
5000|$|Electrically powered models utilize {{mechanical}} or electronic {{speed control}} units {{to adjust the}} amount of power delivered to the electric motor. The power delivered {{is proportional to the}} amount of throttle called for by the transmitter - the more you pull the trigger, the faster it goes. The voltage is [...] "pulsed" [...] using transistors to produce varying output with smooth transitions and greater efficiency. Electronic speed controllers use solid state components to regulate duty cycle, adjusting the power delivered to the electrical motor. In addition, most electronic speed controllers can use the electric motor as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake,</b> offering better control of the model than is possible with a mechanical speed control.Mechanical speed controllers use a network of resistors and switch between them by rotating a head with an electrode around a plate that has electrical contacts. Mechanical speed controllers are prone to being slow to react because they are actuated by servos, waste energy in the form of heat from the resistors, commonly become dirty and perform intermittently, and lack a dedicated braking ability. They appear only in vintage RC models, and are now essentially obsolete.Most electric cars up to recently used brushed motors but now many people are turning to brushless motors for their higher power output and because they require much less maintenance. They are rated either in relative turns or Kv. The Kv number tells how many RPM the motor will turn per volt, assuming no load and maximum efficiency. However, the ability of the system to put out power is dependent {{on the quality of the}} batteries used, wires and connectors supplying power. Due to their power, brushless motors are also used in bigger monster trucks and 1/8 nitro-powered buggies that have been converted to electric. High quality brushless systems can be much more powerful than nitro and can accomplish feats such as standing backflips when installed in a monster truck, most notably the HPI Savage Flux. Some 1/5 scale gas to electric conversions are in production but are uncommon due to high price.A new (2012) form of electric r/c racing is MAGracing. Small 1/32 scale cars and powered by rechargeable batteries and steering and speed are controlled by r/c. Extra steering guidance is provided by steel wires hidden in the track surface enabling more accurate steering than is attainable with free running r/c cars. Tracks can therefore be much narrower and smaller making the system suitable for 'in home' racing. Cars can be driven back onto the track afteran 'off', using reverse if necessary, so that track marshals are not required.|$|E

40|$|A binary {{in which}} a {{slightly}} evolved star starts mass transfer to a neutron star can evolve towards ultra-short orbital periods {{under the influence of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> This is called magnetic capture. In a previous paper we showed that ultra-short periods are only reached for an extremely small range of initial binary parameters, in particular orbital period and donor mass. Our conclusion was based on one specific choice for the law of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> and for the loss of mass and angular momentum during mass transfer. In this paper we show that for less efficient <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> it is impossible to evolve to ultra-short periods, independent of the amount of mass and associated angular momentum lost from the binary.

40|$|Abstract: For an {{effective}} search for survivors over debris in collapsed buildings, {{the authors have}} been developing the Throw and Collect type rescue inspector.

40|$|I {{describe}} {{a series of}} processes, including hierarchical fragmentation, gravitational scattering, Kozai cycles within triple systems, tidal friction and <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> that I believe are responsible for producing the modest but significant fraction of stars that are observed as contact binaries. I also discuss further processes, namely heat transport, mass transport, nuclear evolution, thermal relaxation oscillations, and further <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> with tidal friction, that influence the evolution during contact. The endpoint, for contact, {{is that the two}} components merge into a single star, as recently was observed in the remarkable system V 1309 Sco. The single star probably throws off some mass and rotates rapidly at first, and then slows by <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> to become a rather inconspicuous but normal dwarf or subgiant. If however the contact binary was part of a triple system originallyâ€“as I suggested above was rather likelyâ€“then the result could be a widish binary with apparently non-coeval components.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} upper-end X-ray {{luminosity}} function (XLF) observed in elliptical galaxies for point sources. We {{propose that the}} observed XLF is dominated by transient BH systems in outburst and the XLF shape reflects the black hole (BH) mass spectrum among old X-ray transients. The BH mass spectrum [...] XLF connection depends on a weighting factor that {{is related to the}} transient duty cycle and depends on the host-galaxy age, the BH mass and the donor type (main sequence, red giant, or white dwarf). We argue that the assumption of a constant duty cycle for all systems leads to results inconsistent with current observations. The type of dominant donors in the upper-end XLF depends on what type of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> operates: in the case of ``standard'' <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> BH X-ray binaries with red-giant donors dominate, {{and in the case of}} weaker <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> prescriptions main sequence donors dominate.

40|$|The {{bifurcation}} {{period in}} low-mass X-ray binaries is the initial orbital pe- riod which separates {{the formation of}} converging systems (which evolve with decreasing orbital periods until the donor becomes degenerate) from the diverging systems (which evolve with increasing orbital periods until the donor star loses its envelope and a wide detached binary is formed). We calculate systematically the bifurcation periods of binary systems with a 1. 4 M_ neutron star and a 0. 5 - 2 M_ donor star, taking into account different kinds of <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> and mass loss mechanisms. Our {{results show that the}} saturated <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> can considerably decrease the values of bifurcation period compared to the traditional <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> while the influence of mass loss mechanisms on bifurcation periods is quite weak.

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are silent}} and are much {{smoother}} than friction brakes, gradually increasing the braking power {{so that the}} people on the ride do not experience rapid changes in deceleration. Many modern roller coasters, especially those being manufactured by Intamin, have utilized <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> for several years. Another major roller coaster designer implementing these brakes is Bolliger & Mabillard in 2004 on their Silver Bullet inverted coaster, making it the first inverted roller coaster to feature <b>magnetic</b> <b>brakes,</b> and again used them on their newer projects, such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland. These later applications have proven effectively comfortable and relevant for these inverted coasters which often give the sense of flight. There also exist third party companies such as Magnetar Technologies Corp. which provide various configurations of the technology to be used to replace and retrofit braking systems on existing roller coasters to increase safety, improve rider comfort, and lower maintenance costs and labor.|$|R
