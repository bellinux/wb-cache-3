With radiomarked wolves, the count is straightforward but {{estimation of}} area is more difficult and often given inadequate attention. The population area, based on the mosaic <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> territories, is influenced by sampling intensity similar to individual home ranges. If sampling intensity is low, population area will be underestimated and wolf density will be inflated. Using data from studies in Denali National Park and Preserve, I investigated these relationships using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate effects of radiolocation effort and number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>packs</b> on density estimation. As the number <b>of</b> adjoining <b>pack</b> home ranges increase, fewer relocations are necessary to define a given percentage of population area. I evaluated the utility of nonlinear regression to adjust for biases associated with under sampling and present recommendations for monitoring wolves via radiotelemetry...|$|R

40|$|By using a protein-design {{algorithm}} that quantitatively considers side-chain <b>packing,</b> {{the effect}} <b>of</b> specific steric constraints on protein design was assessed {{in the core}} of the streptococcal protein G beta 1 domain. The strength <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> constraints used in the design was varied, resulting in core sequences that reflected differing amounts <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity. The structural flexibility and stability of several of the designed proteins were experimentally determined and showed a trend from well-ordered to highly mobile structures as the degree <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity in the design decreased. This trend both demonstrates that the inclusion <b>of</b> specific <b>packing</b> interactions is necessary for the design of native-like proteins and defines a useful range <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity for the design algorithm. In addition, an analysis of the modeled protein structures suggested that penalizing for exposed hydrophobic surface area can improve design performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> aluminization <b>of</b> unalloyed nickel in <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> varying aluminum {{activity with}} various halide activators were studied. Surface compositions of the coatings as functions of time, temperature, and pack composition were obtained {{in order to}} establish the boundary conditions for diffusion in the system. The structure <b>of</b> the <b>packs</b> was also examined in order to clarify the mechanism of aluminum transport. The results indicate that the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> aluminization are controlled jointly by gas diffusion in the pack and solid diffusion in the coating. Levine and Caves' model for gas diffusion was combined with calculations of rates of diffusion in the solid to formulate a more complete theory for the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> aluminization...|$|R

Sink <b>marks</b> is one <b>of</b> several important flaws of injection molded parts. In this project, numerical simulation is combined with Taguchi design-of-experiment (DOE) technique to investigate the influence of parameters on sink <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> the injection molded part and optimization of parameter settings in injection molding process. The Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and polyethylene (PE) materials were {{used to analyze the}} sink marks. An orthogonal array based on the Taguchi’s method and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to observe the sink <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> injection molded parts, and to allocate the significant of each factor that contribute to sink marks. Four factors were consisting <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> pressure, mold temperature, melt temperature and packing time. These factors were found to be the principal factors affecting the sink <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> the injection molded parts. It was found that optimum parameters for ABS material are packing pressure at 375 MPa, mold temperature at 400 c, melt temperature at 2000 c and packing time and packing time 1 s. While for PE material, the optimum parameter was found are packing pressure at 75 MPa,mold temperature at 700 c, Melt temperature at 1900 c and packing time at 1. 5 s...|$|R
