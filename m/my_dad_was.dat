25|$|<b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, {{but my father}} never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E

Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system."

Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, {{a former member of}} Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran.

Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, [...] "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race {{up to the top of}} the stupa". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.|$|E

Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> chief then, and we knew we had to have something to present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it.

2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando. Parallelisms can be established between its [...] "futuristic grooves" [...] and other contemporary dance styles such as techno and Balearic beat. However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were into a lot of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what you get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|E
