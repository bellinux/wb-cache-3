40|$|Rutherford {{backscattering}} and channeling spectrometry (RBS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy {{and transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM) {{have been used to}} investigate macroscopic and <b>microscopic</b> <b>segregation</b> in MOCVD grown InGaN layers. The PL peak energy and In content (measured by RES) were mapped at a large number of distinct points on the samples. An indium concentration of 40 %, the highest measured in this work, corresponds to a PL peak of 710 nn strongly suggesting that the light-emitting regions of the sample me very indium-rich compared to the average measured by RES. Cross-sectional TEM observations show distinctive layering of the InGaN films. The TEM study further reveals that these layers consist of amorphous pyramidal contrast features with sizes of order 10 nm The composition of these specific contrast features is shown to be In-rich compared to the nitride matrix. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{model for}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>segregation</b> in a {{homogeneous}} system of particles moving on a one-dimensional lattice. Particles tend to separate from each other, and evolution ceases when at least one empty site is found between any two particles. Motion {{is a mixture of}} diffusion to nearest-neighbour sites and long-range jumps, known as annealed small-world propagation. The long-range jump probability plays the role of the small-world disorder. We show that there is an optimal value of this probability, for which the segregation process is fastest. Moreover, above a critical probability, the time needed to reach a fully segregated state diverges for asymptotically large systems. These special values of the long-range jump probability depend crucially on the particle density. Our system is a novel example of the rare dynamical processes with critical behaviour at a finite value of the small-world disorder. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{redistribution}} of hydrogen during solid phase epitaxial regrowth (SPER) of preamorphized silicon has been experimentally investigated, modeled, and simulated for different H concentrations and temperatures. H {{was introduced by}} H implantation and/or infiltration from the sample surface during partial thermal anneals in air in the 520 - 620 degrees C temperature range. We characterized the time evolution of the H redistribution by secondary ion mass spectrometry and time resolved reflectivity. The good agreement between all experimental data and the simulations by means of full rate equation numerical calculations allows the quantitative assessment of all the phenomena involved: in-diffusion from annealing atmosphere and the H effect on the SPER rate. We describe the temperature dependence of <b>microscopic</b> <b>segregation</b> of H at the amorphous/crystal (a-c) interface. Only a fraction of H atoms pushed by the a-c interface {{can be incorporated into}} the crystal bulk. We propose an energetic scheme of H redistribution in amorphous Si. The segregation of H at the a-c interface is also considered for (110) and (111) orientated substrates. Our description can also be applied to other material systems in which {{redistribution of}} impurities during a solid-solid phase transition occurs. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study {{properties}} of the solutions {{of a family of}} second order integrodifferential equations, which describe the large scale dynamics of a class of <b>microscopic</b> phase <b>segregation</b> models with particle conserving dynamics. We first establish existence and uniqueness as well as some {{properties of}} the instantonic solutions. Then we concentrate on formal asymptotic (sharp interface) limits. We argue that the obtained interface evolution laws (a Stefan–like problem and the Mullins–Sekerka solidification model) coincide with the ones which can be obtained in the analogous limits from the Cahn–Hilliard equation, the fourth order PDE which is the standard macroscopic model for phase segregation with one conservation law. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is {{currently}} {{developing a new}} casting simulation tool (known as Telluride 1) that employs robust, high-resolution finite volume algorithms for incompressible fluid flow, volume tracking of interfaces, and solidification physics on 3 -D unstructured meshes.

The flow algorithm is a 3 -D extension of recent efforts on projection method solutions of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.

40|$|The {{transition}} from amorphous to polycrystalline microstructure {{has been studied}} in sputtered Co x Si 1 -x alloy films by structural, magneto-optical and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements. For x ≥ 0. 76, Si is diluted into Co without significantly altering the polycrystalline microstructure, composed of a mixture of hcp and fcc grains. However, the fraction of Co atoms {{that contribute to the}} Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal is found to decrease steeply (down to about 60 % at x= 0. 76) suggesting a <b>microscopic</b> <b>segregation</b> of a Si rich phase that induces a large degree of disorder. This is reflected in a harder magnetic behavior and a strong anisotropy dispersion. Below x= 0. 75, the transition to an amorphous microstructure results in a sudden increase in the fraction of Co atoms within a ferromagnetic phase, indicating the recovery of the microscopic homogeneity. Also a significant enhancement of the macroscopic magnetic anisotropy is found for amorphous films with compositions right below the transition. Within the amorphous phase a second regime of Si segregation appears characterized by a constant Co local environment and constant magnetic properties. Finally, for x= 0. 65 there is a significant Si enrichment in the Co environment and the films become non magnetic for compositions below this point.

40|$|Hear {{and mass}} {{transfer}} in float-zone processing are {{strongly influenced by}} convective flows in the zone. They are caused by buoyancy convection, thermocapillary (Marangoni) convection, or artificial sources such as rotation and radio frequency heating. Flows in conducting melts can be controlled {{by the use of}} magnetic fields, either by damping fluid motion with static fields or by generating a def@ned flow with rotating fields. The possibilities of using static and rotating magnetic fields in silicon floating-zone growth have been investigated by experiments in axial static fields up to ST and in transverse rotating magnetic fields up to 7. S mT. Static fields of a few 100 MT already suppress most striations but are detrimental to the radial segregation by introducing a coring effect. A complete suppression of dopant striations caused by time-dependent thermocapillary convection and a reduction of the coring to insignificant values, combined with a shift of the axial segregation profile towards a more diffusion-limited case, is possible with static fields ? 1 T. However, under certain conditions the use of high axial magnetic fields can lead to the appearance of a new type of pronounced dopant striations, caused by thermoelec:romagnetic convection.

40|$|Abstract. The {{inversion}} of helioseismic modes {{leads to the}} sound velocity inside the Sun with a precision of about 0. 1 per cent. Compari-sons of solar models with the "seismic sun " represent powerful tools to test the physics: depth of the convection zone, equation of state, opacities, element diffusion processes and mixing inside the radiative zone. We now have evidence that <b>microscopic</b> diffusion (element <b>segregation)</b> does occur below the convection zone, leading to a mild helium depletion in the solar outer layers. Meanwhile this process must be slowed down by some macroscopic effect, presumably rotation-induced mixing. The same mixing is also responsible for the observed lithium depletion. On the other hand, the observations of beryllium and helium 3 impose specific con-straints on the depth of this mildly mixed zone. Helioseismology also gives information on the internal solar rotation: while differential rotation exists in the convection zone, solid rotation prevails in the radiative zone, and the transition layer (the so-called "tachocline") is very small. These effects are discussed, together with the astrophysical constraints on the solar neutrino fluxes. Key words. Helioseismology—diffusion—light elements—abundances. 1...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous {{magnetic}} {{and transport}} properties {{observed in the}} La 0. 8 -xEuxSr 0. 2 MnO 3 (0. 04 l. e x l. e. 0. 36) compounds are presented in this paper. The Curie temperature (TC) decreases from 260 K for x = 0. 04 to 188 K for x = 0. 16 and surprisingly thereafter increases for higher Eu concentrations (x > 0. 16) and becomes nearly constant ~ 230 K. Resistivity increases with Eu concentration up to x = 0. 16 but decreases for higher Eu concentration (x > 0. 16). In the magnetoresistance data, {{in addition to a}} peak corresponding to the insulator-metal transition at (TI-M 1), a second peak is also observed at a relatively lower temperature, (TI-M 2). Both TI-M 1 and TI-M 2 follow the same trend as TC. The unique variation of TC and magnetoresistance is explained on the basis of structure and disorder correlated to <b>microscopic</b> electronic phase <b>segregation.</b> The studies with the existing studies also point to the universibility of this consideration.
