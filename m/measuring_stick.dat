2500|$|The {{essential}} idea of [...] "fractured" [...] dimensions has a {{long history}} in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions. In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the <b>measuring</b> <b>stick</b> used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} a fractal {{dimension}} rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension. As Fig. 4 illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one <b>measuring</b> <b>stick</b> then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first. This holds in 2 dimensions, as well. If one measures the area of a square then measures again {{with a box of}} side length 1/3 the size of the original, one will find 9 times as many squares as with the first measure. Such familiar scaling relationships can be defined mathematically by the general scaling rule in Equation 1, where the variable [...] stands for the number of sticks, [...] for the scaling factor, and [...] for the fractal dimension: ...|$|E

Additionally the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing [...] "inefficiencies" [...] in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a <b>measuring</b> <b>stick</b> against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return.

Nash said to Vince McMahon that he did not want to leave the WWF (he said that McMahon {{had been the first}} to believe in him as a wrestler, and that WCW had tried to ruin his career with his previous characters of Vinnie Vegas, Oz, and Master Blaster Steel), and that if McMahon was willing to match the offer, he would stay. McMahon said no because, according to Nash, he would have had to offer matching contracts to other wrestlers and with the promotion in a bad financial situation, he simply could not afford to.

40|$|Abstract: The {{challenge}} {{of this essay}} was {{to demonstrate that the}} units of Planck’s con-stant are not [J x s]. Borrowing from the logic of the calibration, an attempt was made to find a complete set of small scale <b>measuring</b> <b>sticks</b> for each of time, space, mass, charge and temperature. This however was not possible unless we let the units of Planck’s constant be [J]. It appears that Planck et al forgot to incorporate measure-time into the famous energy equation, E = hν. The extra unit of [s] that is normally assigned to h actually belongs to a previously hidden measure-time variable. This logic suggests that Planck’s constant is an energy constant and not an action constant. After correcting this error, a complete set of unit <b>measuring</b> <b>sticks,</b> calibrated to the time scale of the cycle was calculated. A self-similar unit set was then calibrated to the time scale of the second. The scalability and self-similarity of these unit sets opens the door to the fractal paradigm, one of the main motivations for this research. This small change to the units of Planck’s constant has far reaching implications. All equations that contain h need to be reevaluated. All interpretations founded in unit analysis need to be reexamined. Much work still {{needs to be done to}} vindicate this approach...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} {{of physical and}} chemical processes in the interstellar medium requires detailed knowledge of how atoms and molecule adsorb on dust grains. However, the sticking coefficient, a number between 0 and 1 that measures {{the first step in}} the interaction of a particle with a surface, is usually assumed in simulations of ISM environments to be either 0. 5 or 1. Here we report on the determination of the sticking coefficient of H$_ 2 $, D$_ 2 $, N$_ 2 $, O$_ 2 $, CO, CH$_ 4 $, and CO$_ 2 $ on non-porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW). The <b>sticking</b> coefficient was <b>measured</b> over a wide range of surface temperatures using a highly collimated molecular beam. We showed that the standard way of <b>measuring</b> the <b>sticking</b> coefficient [...] - the King-Wells method [...] - leads to the underestimation of trapping events in which there is incomplete energy accommodation of the molecule on the surface. Surface scattering experiments with the use of a pulsed molecular beam are used instead to <b>measure</b> the <b>sticking</b> coefficient. Based on the values of the <b>measured</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient we suggest a useful general formula of the sticking coefficient as a function of grain temperature and molecule-surface binding energy. We use this formula in a simulation of ISM gas-grain chemistry to find the effect of sticking on the abundance of key molecules both on grains and in the gas-phase.

Thermal desorption spectra from CH 4, Xe and SF 6 {{as well as those of}} MeOH, EtOH and H 2 O can be used to obtain adsorbate binding energies. The observed trends in the binding energies of gases with different van der Waals radii suggest that so-called groove sites on the external bundle surface are the preferred low coverage adsorption sites due to their higher binding energy. These results shed new light on the wetting properties of SWNT bundles. In addition we find that <b>measured</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficients can be related to the diffusion kinetics of adsorbates into the bulk of the nanotube samples...|$|R

At {{the level of a}} generalized Langevin oscillator (GLO) model we achieve good agreement with experimental data. The agreement is similarly reached for PESs based on two different semi-local density-functional theory functionals. This robustness of the simulated sticking curve does not extend to the underlying adsorption mechanism, which is predominantly directly dissociative for one functional or molecularly trapped for the other. Completely different adsorption mechanisms therewith lead to rather similar sticking curves that agree equally well with the experimental data.
