50|$|Originally, mobile armours {{were built}} {{to compete with}} mobile suits.While Zeonic Co. was {{building}} MS as {{the next generation of}} mobile weapons for Zeon before the One Year War, the rival company MIP was developing MA. However, MIP lost the competition, mainly due to their competing prototype, MIP-X1, even though it had superior performance when compared to the inferior AMBAC prototype Zeonic design, it had less than 10 minutes combat time because of its performance being based on consuming great amount of propellant and could hardly fight on its own without heavy support from its mothership for resupplies, MAs were never mass-produced. Later, both Zimmad (another rival company which later developed the famous MS-09 Dom) and MIP became sub-contractors of Zeonic Co. and assisted in the mass-production of mobile suits. Zeon, later in the one-year war, reconsidered the concept of MA due to the advancement of beam weapons in the Earth Federation MS which their own MS cannot equip due to a shortage of power, larger units like MAs better served the purpose of equipping high power output beam weapons, and were reintroduced into the war as test beds for different technologies that would be hard to <b>minimize</b> <b>to</b> fit a MS.|$|E

40|$|Staff in the Division of New Reactor Licensing (DNRL) {{requested}} {{assistance from}} the Division of Waste Management and Environmental Protection (DWMEP) {{in the development of}} a standard review plan (SRP) for the licensing of new reactor facilities. Specifically, DNRL staff requested a list of high-level decommissioning lessons-learned that new applicants for a reactor license should address in order to <b>minimize,</b> <b>to</b> the extent practicable, contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and <b>minimize,</b> <b>to</b> the extent practicable, the generation of radioactive waste. DWMEP staff met with your staff several times to discuss and clarify the requested input. This requested information is provided in Enclosure 1. I would like to bring to your attention other sources of decommissioning lessons-learned. The list of lessons-learned provided in Enclosure 1 is a subset of a much larger set of decommissioning lessons-learned. DWMEP developed the list in Enclosure 1 by reviewing the lessons-learned described in other documents (Enclosure 2) and selecting those it felt were most significant, based on DWMEP decommissioning experience. Additionally, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has developed decommissioning lessons-learned. DWMEP has not reviewed those lessons-learned because they are considered proprietary information by EPRI. DWMEP staff also developed a comprehensive bibliography of documents containing decommissioning lessons-learned. The bibliography is posted on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s public website.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} occur {{every day}} and everywhere in the world; Man inhabiting these areas, often face the loss of lives and settlements, and damage to the property. He loses means of livelihood and encounters great hardships. However when immediate risk of danger is over, and the period of tragic misery has passed, he returns to his natural habitat and continues {{to live in the}} same environment, starting life all over again from the beginning. Floods, in Sri Lanka, regarding, which this study concentrates, are a seasonal disaster, which people have learned to live with, in spite of the damage to life and settlements. The main objective of this study therefore, is to discuss guidelines which can help minimize the damage to buildings, by planning and designing and by use of suitable building material. The indigenous methods so far used in building construction have been obtained through a study of literature, as well as by a field study conducted in flood prone areas of Ratnapura and Ruwanwella in Sri Lanka. It is evident that much of the damage to life and buildings is {{due to the lack of}} a scientific knowledge of the methods so far used. Therefore, the recommendations presented in this study will help to <b>minimize</b> <b>to</b> a great extent, the damage caused by floods, today and enable people to <b>minimize</b> <b>to</b> some extent the after effects of this seasonal disaster...|$|E
40|$|Backpropagation was {{originally}} derived {{in the context}} of minimizing a mean-squared error (MSE) objective function. More recently there has been interest in objective functions that provide accurate class probability estimates. In this talk we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the required form of an objective function to provide probability estimates. This leads to the definition of a general class of functions which includes MSE and cross entropy (CE) as two of the simplest cases. We establish the equivalence of these functions to Maximum Likelihood estimation and the more general principle of Minimum Description Length models. Empirical results are used to demonstrate the tradeoffs associated with the choice of objective functions which <b>minimize</b> <b>to</b> a probability...|$|E
