ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis (KW) tests were used to differentiate water parameters between groups (group significance), of ANU-P, ANU-NP, POL-P and POL-NP based on mean and <b>median</b> <b>values,</b> respectively. ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis (KW) tests measure significant group difference by comparing the group mean or <b>median</b> <b>values</b> with the mean or median of total group, respectively. The null hypotheses (H 0) for ANOVA and KW tests were that mean and <b>median</b> <b>values</b> of a variable {{were not significantly different}} from group mean and <b>median</b> <b>values,</b> respectively. Dunnett’s T 3 post hoc test was used to identify which two groups were significantly different based on mean values, and Mann–Whitney’s post hoc test was used to identify which two groups were significantly different based on <b>median</b> <b>values.</b> Significant differences were determined at p[*]<[*] 0.05 at 95 % confidence level.

30|$|For {{the sake}} of correctness, it is worth {{reminding}} that the IRI model works the best when considering long series of monthly <b>median</b> <b>values,</b> while in this work the IRI model was compared directly with plasma measurements on a limited period of time.
