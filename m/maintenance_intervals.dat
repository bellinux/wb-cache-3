25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals</b> of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E

The extinguisher is checked that it has the correct volume and pressure of extinguishing agent, that it is within the required hydrotest and internal <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals,</b> that it is in good condition, and that all external parts are still serviceable. Dry chemical and dry powder types may also be hit on the bottom with a rubber mallet to make sure the powder is free-flowing.

25|$|Porsche's Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, {{with very}} high {{temperature}} capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (therefore reducing the unsprung {{weight of the}} vehicle), {{a significant reduction in}} dust generation, substantially increased <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals,</b> and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense.

The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.|$|E
40|$|Currently, lack of {{preventive}} measure {{is the problem}} that implicates poor maintenance outcome. Scheduled maintenance is claimed as a maintenance strategy to tackle the problem. However, the effectiveness of scheduled maintenance can be greatly influenced by the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval.</b> Thus, this paper aims to study the relationship between length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> and <b>maintenance</b> performance. The literature review identifies the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> as an importance characteristic of scheduled maintenance strategy. A quantitative approach is adopted and carried out through questionnaire survey. Subsequently, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the collected data. Then, research result demonstrates that the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> is significantly correlated to the maintenance performance. The length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> {{must be considered in}} maintenance planning and execution. The research recommends continuous monitoring or regular inspection of building systems and components to identify their condition and update the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> regularly. Consequently, the effective maintenance execution helps to avoid systems failure occurs and optimises maintenance performance...|$|R

40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} {{inspection and}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often {{inspection and maintenance}} activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> estimation modeling {{is available in the}} concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown inspection and maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing inspection and maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned inspection and maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective inspection and maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown inspection and maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown inspection and maintenance strategy...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{the optimal}} {{preventive}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> for an unreliable production {{system has been}} determined by maximizing its limiting availability. Nowadays, it is widely recognized that this performance measure does not always provide relevant information for practical purposes. This is particularly true for order-driven manufacturing systems, in which due date performance has become a more important, and even a competitive factor. Under these circumstances, the so-called interval availability distribution is often seen as a more appropriate performance measure. Surprisingly enough, the relation between preventive <b>maintenance</b> and <b>interval</b> availability has received little attention in the existing literature. In this article, a series of mathematical models and optimization techniques is presented, with which the optimal preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> can be determined from an interval availability point of view, rather than from a limiting availability perspective. Computational results for a class of representative test problems indicate that significant improvements of up to 30 % in the guaranteed interval availability can be obtained, by increasing preventive maintenance frequencies somewhere between 10 and 70 %...|$|R
