40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} hinder discussions regarding {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) between {{primary care physicians}} (PCPs) and their patients in Sweden. Setting: Primary health care centres (PHCCs) in Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects: A total of 59 PCPs. Design: Semi-structured individual and focus-group interviews between 2012 and 2014. Data were analysed inspired by grounded theory methods (GTM). Results: Time-pressured patient-doctor consultations lead to deprioritization of COPD. During unscheduled visits, deprioritization resulted from focusing only on acute health concerns, while during routine care visits, COPD was deprioritized in <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> The reasons PCPs gave for deprioritizing COPD are: Not becoming aware of COPD, Not becoming concerned due to clinical features, Insufficient local routines for COPD care, Negative personal attitudes and views about COPD, Managing diagnoses one at a time, and Perceiving a patient's motivation as low''. Conclusions: De-prioritization of COPD was discovered during PCP consultations and several factors were identified associated with time constraints and multi-morbidity. A holistic consultation approach is suggested, plus extended consultation time for <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients,</b> and better documentation and local routines...|$|R
30|$|Screw {{loosening}} is a {{very important}} finding in 13 patients (56.5  %) in this series. We assume that slowly progressing loosening of screws causes repeated micro-fractures in pedicles and endplates. These micro-fractures lead to small haematomas in bone tissue in pedicles, endplates and most importantly in the endplate–disc attachment. Subsequent infection of these haematomas in previously infected and operated spinal region is likely to occur, especially in <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> with poor general condition.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{challenges}} of prescribing optimisation {{in the growing}} population of multi-morbid older people with complex polypharmacy are considerable. Since most people who prescribe medication for <b>multi-morbid</b> older <b>patients</b> do not have specific training or expertise in medication optimisation or complex polypharmacy, {{there is a need}} for a novel, systematic and reliable solution to address this challenge. Methods: In 2012, the SENATOR consortium (www. senator-project. eu) was funded under the EU’s FP 7 programme to design and test by clinical trial a software engine specifically designed for drug/nondrug treatment optimisation in older people with multi-morbidity and associated complex polypharmacy. In partnership with a healthcare software SME, the SENATOR consortium has developed a software engine for this purpose. The consortium has also embarked on a randomised clinical trial (RCT) comparing the effects of SENATOR softwareguided prescribing optimisation in older <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> hospitalised with acute illness with standard pharmaceutical care in 6 European centres, randomised into two groups of approximately 900 patients each. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients experiencing one or more non-trivial ADR’s during their index hospitalisation. Other outcome measures include medication appropriateness, all-cause in-patient mortality, cost of composite healthcare utilization and quality of life at 12 weeks follow-up. The SENATOR RCT will be completed in 2017. Conclusions: The SENATOR software tool is designed to curtail polypharmacy, inappropriate prescribing and prevent non-trivial adverse drug reactions/events. The SENATOR RCT will determine its efficacy in acutely ill older <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> cared for by clinicians other than geriatricians...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Revision {{arthroplasty}} {{of the hip}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important in recent years. Early primary arthroplasty and longer life expectancy of the patients increases the number of revision surgery. Revision surgery of hip arthroplasty is major surgery for the patients, especially the elderly, with significant risks concerning the general condition of the patient. The aim of this work is to evaluate the outcome of bipolar hip arthroplasty as a salvage procedure for treatment of loosening of the acetabular cup with significant acetabular bone defects after total hip replacement (THR) in <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> Patients and methods: During the period from January 1 2007 to December 31 2011 19 revision hip surgeries were performed in, in which the loosened acetabular cup {{was replaced by a}} bipolar head. The examined patient group consisted exclusively of female patients with an average of 75 years. The predominant diagnosis was “aseptic loosening” (84. 2 %). All patients in our study were multi-morbid. We decided to resort to bipolar hip arthroplasty due to the compromised general condition of patients and the major acetabular bone defects, which were confirmed intraoperatively. The postoperative follow-up ranged from 0. 5 to 67 months (average 19. 1 months). Results: Evaluation of the modified Harris Hip Score showed an overall improvement of the function of the hip joint after surgery of approximately 45 %. Surgery was less time consuming and thus adequate for patients with significantly poor general health condition. We noticed different complications in a significant amount of patients (68. 4 %). The most common complication encountered was the proximal migration of the bipolar head. The rate of revision following the use of bipolar hip arthroplasty in revision surgery of the hip in our patients was high (21 %). Despite the high number of complications reported in our study, we have noticed significant improvement of hip joint function as well as subjective pain relief in the majority of patients. We clearly achieved clinically satisfactory results in 14 patients. Conclusion: Bipolar hip arthroplasty is by no means to be regarded as standard procedure in revision surgery of THR. It provides an option or salvage procedure for patients with poor general condition in whom the quickest possible surgical intervention preserving mobility is required. This is particularly true for <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> in whom sufficient acetabular fixation is not possible...|$|R

Methods: A total of 3, 189 non-demented, multi-morbid participants aged 65 – 85 years were recruited in primary care within the German MultiCare-study. Physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and quantity and quality of nutritional intake were classified as relevant lifestyle factors.

40|$|International audienceBackground:The {{frequency}} of antidepressant (ADs) prescription is high, with general practitioners (GPs) responsible for about 80 % of the prescriptions. Some studies considered prescriptions meet DSM criteria, whileothers stress inadequate use. The importance of biological and psychosocial determinants of GP prescriptionbehaviour remains little explored. We aimed {{to describe the}} importance of these biological and psychosocialdeterminants and their weight in the daily practice of GPs’. Methods:During a week chosen at random, 28 GPs collected the AD prescriptions made within the previous sixmonths, regardless of the reason for the patient contact. Bio psychosocial and AD treatment characteristics wererecorded for all patients. In a random sample of 50 patients, patient characteristics were assessed via a structuredface-to-face interview with the GP. Results:The {{frequency of}} AD prescription was 8. 90 % [3. 94 - 17. 02]. The GPs initiated 65. 6 % [60. 1 - 70. 8] of theprescriptions. The rate of AD prescription for non-psychiatric conditions was 18 %. Patients had from 1 to 9 conditions,showing a high level of multi-morbidity. There was a strong influence of past medical history and contextual problems,such as work related problems. Conclusion:AD prescription is related to complex contextualsituations and <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> GPs use abio psycho social approach, rather than a purely biological assessment.

40|$|Orthopaedic surgery has low HAI incidences {{compared}} to other surgical disciplines. However, when they do occur, these infections are associated with substantial morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, exorbitant costs, and difficulties in eradication with life-long recurrence risks of around 10 - 20 %, {{especially in the case}} of multi-resistant pathogens. Prevention remains of the utmost importance and harbours some hallmarks not shared with other surgical disciplines: low inoculum for implant infections; pathogenicity of coagulase-negative staphylococci and other skin commensals; possible haematogenous origin; and long post-discharge surveillance periods. An adequate screening and decolonization policy regarding multi-resistant pathogens, cautious antimicrobial use, and iterative epidemiologic interventions remain essential when dealing with <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> hospitalised in specialised septic orthopaedic wards under the constant influence of high-dose and long-lasting antibiotic therapies. Among the many measures to prevent orthopaedic SSI, only some are based on strong evidence, and there is insufficient evidence to show which element is superior over any other. This highlights the need for multimodal approaches involving active post-discharge surveillance, as well as measures at every step of the care process. These range from pre-operative care to surgery and post-operative care, at the individual patient level to department-wide interventions targeting all HAI, including antibiotic stewardship. Although theoretically reducible to zero, the maximal realistic extent to decrease SSI in elective orthopaedic surgery remains unknown...|$|R
40|$|The {{demographic}} changes in Western countries, with {{an aging population}} and medical and technological progresses, have meant an increased demand on treating <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> in intensive care units (Rashid, 2006). Intensive care room {{is the core of}} all activities in providing care for the most critically ill patients. According to European Society of intensive Care Medicine, providing a safe and high quality care requires an integration of human, technological and spatial recourses. The patient rooms in ICU are usually crowded places, characterized by high prevalence of stressors such as high levels of sound and strong lighting and constant activity with a negative effect on the patients’ recovery process. Previous research indicates that the design of patient rooms in ICU {{can be one of the}} causes of developing ICU delirium (Dubois, Bergeron, Dumont, Dial och Skrobik 2001). Furthermore, it is highlighted that there is an increase risk of medical errors in ICU environment due to high levels of sound (Christensen, 2002). Patient safety means preventing suffering or damages of any kind, caused by the health care provider or due to milieu related factors. The design and interior of ICU can have an impact on the patient safety and treatment outcomes.

Body Mass Index (BMI, general obesity) and waist circumference (WC, abdominal obesity) were used as outcome measures and regression analyses were conducted. About one third of all patients were classified as obese according to BMI. The prevalence of abdominal obesity was 73. 5 %. Adjusted for socio-demographic variables and objective and subjective disease burden, participants with low physical activity had a 1. 6 kg/m 2 higher BMI as well as a higher WC (4. 9 cm, p< 0. 001). Current smoking and high alcohol consumption were associated with a lower BMI and WC. In multivariate logistic regression, using elevated WC and BMI as categorical outcomes, the same pattern in lifestyle factors was observed. Only for WC, not current but former smoking was associated with a higher probability for elevated WC. Dietary intake in quantity and quality was not associated with BMI or WC in either model. Further research is needed to clarify if the huge prevalence discrepancy between BMI and WC also reflects a difference in obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Yet, age-specific thresholds for the BMI are needed likewise. Encouraging and promoting physical activity in older adults might a starting point for weight reduction efforts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In many countries, {{substitution}} of physicians by nurses has become common {{due to the}} shortage of physicians {{and the need for}} high-quality, affordable care, especially for chronic and <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> We examined the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and care costs of physician-nurse substitution in primary care. METHODS: We systematically searched OVID Medline and Embase, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL, up to August 2012; selected and critically appraised published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared nurse-led care with care by primary care physicians on patient satisfaction, Quality of Life (QoL), hospital admission, mortality and costs of healthcare. We assessed the individual study risk of bias, calculated the study-specific and pooled relative risks (RR) or standardised mean differences (SMD); and performed fixed-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: 24 RCTs (38, 974 participants) and 2 economic studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses showed higher overall scores of patient satisfaction with nurse-led care (SMD 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 23), in RCTs of single contact or urgent care, short (less than 6 months) follow-up episodes and in small trials (N 200) RCTs. Higher quality RCTs (with better allocation concealment and less attrition) showed higher rates of hospital admissions and mortality with nurse-led care albeit less or not significant. The results seemed more consistent across nurse practitioners than with registered or licensed nurses. The effects of nurse-led care on QoL and costs were difficult to interpret due to heterogeneous outcome reporting, valuation of resources and the small number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence continues to be limited by the quality of the research considered. Nurse-led care seems to {{have a positive effect on}} patient satisfaction, hospital admission and mortality. This important finding should be confirmed and the determinants of this effect should be assessed in further, larger and more methodically rigorous research...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{care for}} acute {{diseases}} has increased mean {{age and the}} proportion of people affected by multiple chronic diseases, while mutated socioeconomic conditions augmented the number of elderly and socially frail subjects. <b>Multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> who require a global approach not-fragmented-care interventions and a close connection between health and social services are progressively growing. Acute Complex Care Model (ACCM) is a model of integrated management of the frail patients when they need acute hospital care. The name of our model - ACCM - just recalls the chronic care model (CCM), designed for the de-hospitalization of chronic patients by preventing acute exacerbations, representing the hospital counterpart of the CCM. The target population is made up of acutely ill complex and poly-pathological patients (AICPPs), admitted to hospital and requiring high technological resources and continuous monitoring; the mission is to improve the management of medical admissions through pre-defined intra-hospital tracks and a global, multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach. Nowadays, multiple uncoordinated specialists care for AICPPs who move from one ward to another, with dangerous loss of information and continuity. ACCM tries to overcome these problems by putting the internal medicine specialist as the only referent for that patient and the coordinator of the care team. According to a model of future hospital organized with different intensity settings, the Internal Medicine Wards, caring for AICPPS, are organized in High Dependency Areas and Ordinary Areas. For both we present organizational and personnel standards that are lacking in daily practice. The epidemiological transition leading to a progressive increase in AICPPs requiring frequent hospitalization enhances the role of hospital internal medicine specialist in the coordination and delivery of care. The ACCM represents a practical response to this epochal change of roles. Medical and nursing staff standards and competencies have to be reviewed to ensure adequate care for these patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeHemothorax {{should be}} {{suspected}} in any patient with blunt chest trauma. However, not every fluid detected by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) is a hemothorax, especially in elderlies and <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> To avoid unnecessary emergent tube thoracostomy, {{we have to}} make the differentiation in a time fashion. PurposeTo assess the applicability of the CT attenuation value in differentiating hemothorax from pleural effusions. MethodsIn this retrospective study, we identified patients who underwent chest CT during a 39 -month period. Patients with definitive diagnoses of hemothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema were enrolled. We selected the 3 non-enhanced CT scan slices containing the largest amount of fluid to measure the Hounsfield unit (HU) values of the pleural fluid, and those of the aortic blood. The HU value ratios of the pleural fluid over aortic blood (P/A) were calculated. We compared the HU and P/A values between the patient groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the validity and cutoff values. ResultsHemothorax had significantly higher attenuation values and P/A ratios than did pleural effusion or empyema (P <  0. 001, respectively). In differentiating hemothorax from pleural effusion, excellent accuracies were obtained with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0. 964 (95 % CI: 0. 931 ∼ 0. 998) for HU values and 0. 951 (95 % CI: 0. 914 ∼ 0. 988) for P/A ratios. The optimal cutoff values were 15. 6 HU (sensitivity: 86. 8 %; specificity: 97. 4 %) and 30. 0 % (sensitivity: 94. 7 %; specificity: 83. 3 %). To distinguish hemothorax from empyema, good accuracies were obtained with an AUC of 0. 866 (95 % CI: 0. 797 ∼ 0. 935) for HU values and 0. 870 (95 % CI: 0. 801 ∼ 0. 938) for P/A ratios. The optimal cutoff values were 15. 9 HU (sensitivity: 86. 8 %; specificity: 71. 2 %) and 56. 0 % (sensitivity: 76. 3 %; specificity: 90. 4 %).

40|$|Xenobiotics are substances, which {{cannot be}} {{synthesized}} by the metabolism {{of the human}} body, but are ingested as drugs or food. This work deals with three aspects of xenobiotics: metabolism, interactions with target molecules for cancer therapy and a specific receptor binding. Although {{the majority of the}} drugs derived from natural compounds, the degradation of these substances is usually a problem for the human organism. The family of cytochrome P 450 enzymes consists of 57 representatives, which are responsible for the oxygenation of xenobiotics, thereby following a conjugation enabling excretion. Establishment of a relation between the structure of a drug and its degrading cytochrome is a difficult task. To get closer to this goal, all currently available information regarding the metabolism of drugs had to be collected. Because of the huge amount of papers, this was only possible via text mining - a specific, automated analysis of online literature databases. After manual curation, this data set was stored in a database and made publicly available via web interface. The found information about common mutations were projected onto the self-generated structural models {{in order to create a}} tool, which allows the physician to optimize the medication with respect to potential problems - especially in <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients.</b> Besides the metabolism, for the optimum effect of drugs it is of vital importance, which signaling pathways involve the respective targets are and where these targets are expressed. Therefore, it is important to make a comprehensive list of interactions between drugs and their target molecules, which in turn is only possible through automatic text mining. To project these relationships to biochemical pathways and the combination with expression data of different tissues allows a more rational therapy. In the context of structural models for the target molecules, mutation data and the chemosensitivity of different tumor types, a universal tool was created, which allows a first step toward individualized cancer therapy. Xenobiotics are important components of various foods. Certain nutrients are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant by the human body during intake, which was evolutionarily important to identify toxic or carbohydrate-rich foods quickly. Today, sugar and sweeteners play an important role in dentistry as they can also induce caries. Through the use of sweeteners diabetic food tastes sweet, improving the compliance of diabetic diet. Surprisingly, no comprehensive collection of information on natural and artificial sweeteners did exist. The focus of this study was therefore on the composition of more extensive information such as sweetness, nutritional value, physicochemical properties, 3 D structures and therapeutic effect. With this information gathered, similarity searches can be carried out and the discovery of novel calorie-free, caries-inhibiting sugars will be supported...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a progressive}} {{disease of the}} arterial vascular system. A sclerosis of the vascular wall leads to to reduced perfusion of the supply area. After exploiting all possibilities of revascularization, a majoramputation is not unavoidable. To maintain the livability after the amputation rapid care of the stump with a prosthesis is desirable. A proper stump healing is therefore obligatory. However, due to the usually <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients</b> collective, a wound healing disorder with infection is not seldom. An alloplastic bypass prosthesis left in situ is an irritant factor in the healing process. The surgical therapy option for a complete bypass explantation {{in the case of}} wound healing of an amputation stump is up for discussion. Methodology A total of 303 patients were examined retrospectively at the Paul Gerhardt Stift in the Lutherstadt Wittenberg between 10 / 2003 and 10 / 2010, which received a PAVK-induced majoramputation. They were investigated for the characteristics of risk factors, age, sex and infection status of the stump postoperatively {{as well as on the}} characteristics of a post-traumatization and a vascular prosthesis, which remains completely explanted or remains in situ during the stump wound healing disorder. Results The risk of post-amputation increases significantly with vascular prosthesis (38. 38 % vs. 25. 15 %). Patients after alloplastic bypass with in-situ prosthesis have significant accumulation of deep stump infections in the presence of the infected vascular graft compared to patients without previous bypass surgery (23, 23 % vs 16, 16 %). A stump after the initially performed vascular prosthesis supply is significantly more frequently after-treated. A total of 40. 40 % of the bypasses are not fully explanted. The infected vascular graft is significantly more frequently explanted than an uninfected prosthesis. The mortality during the stationary treatment of the patients receiving the prosthesis is significantly lower than in the control group without a vascular prosthesis. In the subgroup analysis of the vascular prosthesis-treated patients there is an increased risk of mortality for the patients who have been treated with the prosthesis in situ. Conclusion Even if patients with a vascular prosthesis remaining in situ are frequently more frequently infected with the primary majoramputation and are frequently followed by post-amputation, it is possible to perform a blunt healing without complete vascular prosthesis explantation. Due to a lower mortality of the treatment without prosthesis exploration it is possible to avoid a complete explantation if possible. In the case of deep infection including the prosthesis, a consistent therapeutic approach is indicated despite the increased mortality with complete explantation of the alloplastic material and the subsequent autologous reconstruction with retention of the proundar perfusion. A recommendation for the regular complete explantation of the vascular prosthesis during the primary amputation can not be given...|$|R
40|$|Background: Due to {{technical}} innovations and the increasingly complex surgical and anesthetic techniques in <b>multi-morbid</b> <b>patients,</b> {{the complexity of}} monitoring {{in the field of}} anesthesiology in the past decades increased. So far there are very few studies on the feasibility and Process efficiency of complex high-technology monitoring environment. Methods: The study was conducted in the central-OP (9 operating rooms) in a university hospital. In the surgical disciplines of urology and cardiac surgery the processes of monitoring were recorded in detail by independent observers. The study involved the individual steps for preparation and evaluation of the devices, the duration of the process times for the application of the monitoring and the duration of time without monitoring values (blank time) when changing the premises (Introduction, Operating room and Recovery Room). To detect systemic differences two different monitoring systems (Module system and plug-in system) were investigated. In addition, the frequency of alarms that occured, the reaction of the anesthesiologist to the alarms and the reaction times to the alerts were recorded. Also the percentage of devises in use in the entire Central-OP was recorded. Results: For the duration of the preparation and evaluation of the equipment 50 cases were analyzed. The ventilator took about 50 % of the total time, an average of 10 ± 2. 6 to 16 ± 2. 1 minutes per case. In the study of the process times of perioperative monitoring and the alarm systems 19 cases in cardiac surgery and 82 cases in urology have been included. Substantial time was in cardiac surgery, especially for the attachment of the monitoring in the induction (mean 5. 3 ± 3. 7, respectively. 3. 6 ± 1. 5 minutes per case) in the operating room (mean 4. 0 ± 2. 2, respectively. 2. 7 ± 1. 7 minutes per case), in the ICU (mean 5. 2 ± 2. 4, respectively. 3. 1 ± 2. 2 minutes per case) and the monitoring of transportation (5. 4 ± 3. 4, respectively. 2. 4 ± 2. 3 minutes per case). In urology, the most time-consuming steps to attach the monitoring were in the induction (mean 6. 8 ± 2. 9, respectively. 6. 1 ± 3. 1 minutes per case), in the OR (mean 3. 9 ± 3. 1, respectively. 2. 8 ± 1. 9 minutes per case) and in the recovery room (mean 4. 2 ± 2. 5, respectively. 2. 6 ± 1. 5 minutes per case). Due to the more complex systems, the process times for cardiac patients took much longer. The differences between the systems (module and plug-in system) were only minor and not clinically significant. In determining the time without monitoring were very long blank periods, on average up to 11. 2 ± 8. 4 minutes per case for ECG, 12. 3 ± 5. 8 minutes per case for blood pressure control and 8. 9 ± 3. 9 minutes per case for the pulseoximetry. In part these long times were caused by the incompatibility of the systems. The alarm system showed a high frequency of alarm calls in particular for cardiac surgical patients (mean values per case: 3. 7 ± 6. 4 for ECG, 9. 7 ± 4. 6 for the blood pressure control, 2. 9 ± 2. 3 for pulse oximetry, 3. 9 ± 3. 8 for the ventilation alarms). Most alarms were considered to be clinically irrelevant and ignored, or the alarm signal was turned off. The determination of the utilization of anesthesia equipment resulted in a maximum utilization of 52 % for respiratory equipment, 48 % for the anesthetic and monitoring each 67 % for perfusors and infusomats. Discussion and conclusions: Preparation of anesthesia machine and monitoring systems require a relevant time in workflow, in particular the testing of respiratory equipment is time-consuming. Installation and removal of monitoring devises during change of locality (First, OP, extraction, transport) are time-relevant. Because of the lack of continuous monitoring large times without observation of the patient by monitoring systems were recorded. Because of the incompatibility of certain devices in anesthesia induction, operating room and recovery room / transportation those lacks have been further increased. The alarm systems are mainly due to the high sensitivity with very low specificity of little practical use, and generate primarily non-clinical relevant alarms. If the resulting desensitization should be avoided, systems must be radically improved in this area...|$|R
