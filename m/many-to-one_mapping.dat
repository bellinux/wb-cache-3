40|$|SYNOPSIS. We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} <b>many-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> of form to function and suggest that this emergent property of complex systems promotes the evolution of physiological diversity. Our work has focused on a 4 -bar linkage found in labrid fish jaws that transmits muscular force and motion from the lower jaw to skeletal elements in the upper jaws. Many different 4 -bar shapes produce {{the same amount of}} output rotation in the upper jaw per degree of lower jaw rotation, a mechanical property termed Maxillary KT. We illustrate three consequences of <b>many-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> of 4 -bar shape to Maxillary KT. First, <b>many-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> can partially decouple morphological and mechanical diversity within clades. We found with simulations of 4 -bars evolving on phylogenies of 500 taxa that morphological and mechanical diversity were only loosely correlated (R 2 5 0. 25). Second, redundant mapping permits the simultaneous optimization of more than one mechanical property of the 4 -bar. Labrid fishes have capitalized on this flexibility, as illus-trated by several species that have Maxillary KT 5 0. 8 but have different values of a second property, Nasal KT. Finally, <b>many-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> may increase the influence of historical factors in determining the evo-lution of morphology. Using a genetic model of 4 -bar evolution we exerted convergent selection on three different starting 4 -bar shapes and found that mechanical convergence only created morphological conver-gence in simulations where the starting forms were similar. <b>Many-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> is widespread in physi-ological systems and operates at levels ranging from the redundant mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, up to the morphological basis of whole-organism performance. This phenomenon may be involved in the uneven distribution of functional diversity seen among animal lineages...|$|E

If, however, more than 1 stimulus feature is mapped to each spatial response (<b>many-to-one</b> <b>mapping),</b> priming activation should spread and thus reduce or eliminate the Simon effect.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this work we study the equilibrium properties of systems in two-dimensions, and the effects that discrete symmetry, space dimensionality, character of the interaction and number of internal degrees of freedom have on the properties of two systems of classical and quantum nature. We investigate macroscopic properties from a family of classical Hamiltonian models with discrete degrees of freedom, and we observed how the discreteness of spin variables can be "washed out" in ensemble averages, where different microscopic interactions between molecules or spins, exhibit identical thermodynamic behavior over a wide range of temperatures.

40|$|As {{an image}} of the <b>many-to-one</b> <b>map</b> of loop-erasing {{operation}} of random walks, a self-avoiding walk (SAW) is obtained. The loop-erased random walk (LERW) model is the statistical ensemble of SAWs such that the weight of each SAW ζ is given by the total weight of all random walks π which are inverse images of ζ, {π: (π) =ζ}. We regard the Brownian paths as the continuum limits of random walks and consider the statistical ensemble of loop-erased Brownian paths (LEBPs) as the continuum limits of the LERW model. Following the theory of Fomin on nonintersecting LERWs, we introduce a nonintersecting system of N-tuples of LEBPs in a domain D in the complex plane, where the total weight of nonintersecting LEBPs is given by Fomin's determinant of an N × N matrix whose entries are boundary Poisson kernels in D. We set a sequence of chambers in a planar domain and observe the first passage points at which N Brownian paths (γ_ 1, [...] ., γ_N) first enter each chamber, under the condition that the loop-erased parts ((γ_ 1), [...] ., (γ_N)) make a system of nonintersecting LEBPs in the domain in the sense of Fomin. We prove that the correlation functions of first passage points of the Brownian paths of the present system are generally given by determinants specified by a continuous function called the correlation kernel. The correlation kernel is of Eynard-Mehta type, which has appeared in two-matrix models and time-dependent matrix models studied in random matrix theory.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} MEMS technology into new application domains suggests {{the need for}} sophisticated engineering tools that can automate routine MEMS engineering design functions. This thesis discusses the development of algorithms and automated software tools that are intended to automate the mask-layout process for bulk etch micro-machining. At present, a designer conceives of a MEMS function, then (informally) creates a mask-layout that the designer believes will process into a shape that will exhibit the desired function. Because of the highly anisotropic nature of the bulk etching process, the mask design process relies heavily upon the designer's intuitive understanding of the etching process. A prototype device is created from the candidate mask, and its actual function is tested. This process can result in many iterations, and many prototypes. This dissertation presents a method to automatically synthesize the mask layout for a bulk etching process. That is, given a desired part geometry and process parameters, the algorithm determines a candidate mask geometry that will etch to the final desired shape even {{in the case of}} highly anisotropic etchants. It will also compute compensation structures for di#cult to etch features. Conceptually, the algorithm is based on the use of a forward etch simulation in reverse time. vi Since the forward etch process is a <b>many-to-one</b> <b>map,</b> the reverse time simulation is augmented to include a choice of valid preimages. Timing models are introduced to devlop mask layouts that have appearing crystal planes during the etch and shown to allow more complex compenstation structures. Finally, calibration masks are developed that allow the experimental determination of etch rate parameters without painstaking measurements. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{reorganization}} of hand movements during adaptation to delayed visual feedback in a novel and redundant environment. In most natural behaviors, the brain must learn to invert a <b>many-to-one</b> <b>map</b> from high-dimensional joint movements and muscle forces to a low-dimensional goal. This spatial "inverse map" is learned by associating motor commands to their low-dimensional consequences. How is this map affected by the presence of temporal delays? A delay presents the brain with a new set of kinematic data, and, because of redundancy, the brain may use these data to form a new inverse map. We consider two possible responses to a novel visuomotor delay. In one case, the brain updates the previously learned spatial map, building a new association between motor commands and visual feedback of their effects. In the alternative case, the brain preserves the original map and learns to compensate the delay by a temporal shift of the motor commands. To test these alternative possibilities, we developed a virtual reality game in which subjects controlled the two-dimensional coordinates of a cursor by continuous hand gestures. Two groups of subjects tracked a target along predictable paths by wearing an instrumented data glove that recorded finger motions. The 19 -dimensional glove signals controlled a cursor on a 2 -dimensional computer display. The experiment was performed on 2 consecutive days. On the 1 st day, subjects practiced tracking movements without delay. On the 2 nd day, the test group performed the same task with a delay of 300 ms between the glove signals and the cursor display, whereas the control group continued practicing the non-delayed trials. We found evidence that to compensate for the delay, the test group relied on the coordination patterns established during the baseline, e. g., their hand-to-cursor inverse map was robust to the delay perturbation, which was counteracted by an anticipation of the motor command...|$|R
