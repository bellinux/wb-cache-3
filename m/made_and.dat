5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being <b>made</b> <b>and</b> at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been <b>made,</b> <b>and</b> due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E

The priests elaborated their calendar and their sacrificial ritual through long centuries, but made little progress in other directions.|$|R
5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to the Allied commanders that no further progress would be <b>made</b> <b>and</b> General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Genuine press cards can be {{obtained}} by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be <b>made,</b> <b>and</b> plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made.

5|$|Hamm {{acknowledged}} {{science fiction}} was a niche genre {{when the original}} film was <b>made,</b> <b>and</b> that it used science fiction to make topical issues more approachable. Hamm had the same feelings for this remake. Originally, Hamm's character was French and named Michel. Although he is interested in math and science, Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film his lines repeatedly.|$|E

Another facsimile of the New Testament text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the Codex became widely available.|$|E
