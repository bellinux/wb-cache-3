40|$|A moving <b>model</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> {{based on}} {{stagnation}} pressure measurements is proposed {{to measure the}} train aerodynamic drag coefficient. Because the front tip of a high-speed train has a high pressure area and because a stagnation point occurs {{in the center of}} this region, the pressure of the stagnation point is equal to the dynamic pressure of the sensor tube based on the obtained train velocity. The first derivation of the train velocity is taken to calculate the acceleration of the train model ejected by the moving model system without additional power. According to Newton's second law, the aerodynamic drag coefficient can be resolved through many tests at different train speeds selected within a relatively narrow range. Comparisons are conducted with wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations, and good agreement is obtained, with differences of less than 6. 1 %. Therefore, the moving <b>model</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> proposed in this paper is feasible and reliable...|$|E

However, it is frequently advised that the outlier test {{should not be used}} as a means to automatically reject an outlier.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new outlier separability test to confirm that the identified outlier, by the outlier test, can be confidently rejected as the outlier. In addition, the Minimally Separable Bias and the separability multiplying factor are also obtained for the proposed outlier separability test.

The objectives of the study were specifically to outline a methodology for the correct estimation of the roll radius of gyration of existing and new ships, to apply this methodology to a characteristic sample of existing Ro-Ro passenger ships, to review existing semi-empirical formulas for the determination of the roll radius of gyration of Ro-Ro passenger ships, as suggested by IMO, and to conclude, finally, on the practical implications of the correct estimation and reproduction in model scale of the roll radius of gyration to the validity of the Model Test results. The principal findings from the NTUA investigation were that existing, semiempirical formulas and approximations for the roll radius of gyration do not account for the special features to typical Ro-Ro passenger ships designs and can lead to significantly erroneous results, that the radius of gyration of modern Ro-Ro passenger ships is comparatively large, and that an underestimation of the actual roll radius of gyration and its modeling according to Res. 14, SOLAS 95, will eventually lead to an increased tendency to capsize the ship model in the specified seastate conditions...|$|E
40|$|Within Hydrodynamics, {{estimating}} the roll damping {{are associated with}} difficulties and uncertainty. This is due to roll motion being highly non-linear compared to other degrees of freedom. The non-linearity arises from flow separation. Therefore, empirical formulas have been developed ikeda 1977 roll for classical ship shapes. Nonetheless, {{what happens when the}} ship hull no longer are conventional? This theses have addressed the roll damping problem of an FPSO with sponsons by conducting experiments and numerical simulations of forced roll. A 2 D mid ship section with four bilge keel length, with and without sponsons were investigated. A fixed centre of rotation was adopted based on the freely floating model's natural period in roll. The aim was to identify how the roll damping coefficient changes when sponsons are mounted on the ship side and if the damping can be restored by increasing the bilge keel height. Experimental model tests were perform in Ladertanken, a narrow wave flume. The numerical simulations were conducted using a hybrid method package PVC- 2 DRoll. It was pointed from the results that the total roll damping was strongly dependent on the bilge keel height, both for a vessel with and without sponsons. Further, both the amplitude and period of oscillation affect how the roll damping changes by increasing bilge keel height. For the FPSO with sponsons the roll damping was dominated by the linear damping for small bilge keels, while damping for the classical ship was dominated by quadratic damping, with good similarities to previous studies. Moreover, triple the bilge keel length of the bilge keel after mounting sponsons on the ship we obtained, in order of magnitude, the same bilge keel loads as for a conventional ship with typical bilge keel length. However, the total damping as a function of roll angle was on average 42. 5 % lower than a conventional ship without sponsons. This {{may be due to the}} sponsons forming the midsection more rounded, and hence less eddy-making by the hull. There was satisfactory and comparable results between model tests and numerical simulations for total damping on the model with and without sponsons. Bilge keel damping was extracted from bilge keel loads during the forced roll, and the agreement between experimental and numerical results was good for the model with, while model without sponsons had differences up to 61 %. The reason causing this deviation was not established. Overall it was shown both the <b>model</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> and PVC- 2 DRoll can be used to solve forced roll motion problems with unconventional ship shapes. Challenges using a fixed centre of rotation where established, both physically and practically.

40|$|Method R is {{a simple}} and {{computationally}} inexpensive method for estimating (co) variances. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate properties of Method R for estimation of (co) variance components with emphasis on covariance estimation. Theoretical Method R formulas were developed for simplified single-variate and bivariate models. In single-trait models, the curve of the regression of Method R was continuous and monotonic and its slope depended on the amount of information on each animal and on the variance ratio. The curve became steeper as the number of records per animal decreased. For covariance, the curve of the regression was monotonic but not continuous. However, a regression coefficient of 1 still corresponded to the correct covariance. Similar curves were observed in analyses of simulated data sets. Because of the observed discontinuity, algorithms implementing Method R that require a continuous regression curve would not work in models with: covariances. An alternative algorithm was based on a transformation matrix obtained by multiplying a matrix of numerators with the inverse of a matrix of denominators of the regression factors. Such an algorithm converged reliably for all <b>models</b> <b>tested.</b> <b>Method</b> R can be modified to estimate covariances in models too large for other methods. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{cracking}} and instability of the high and steep left bank slope with weak rock mass structures, and effectiveness of the reinforcements designed for the slope at the Jinping hydroelectricity power station, southwestern China. A new geomechanical <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> is first proposed for evaluating slope safety factors. In the proposed geomechanical <b>model</b> <b>test,</b> the slope is constructed on a flat testing bed, which can be rotated by hydraulic lifts. By increasing the rotation angle of the testing bed, the forces tending to induce the sliding of the slope are increased, which may cause crack initiation and propagation in the slope and result in rock mass slippage. Thus, through the proposed geomechanical <b>model</b> <b>test,</b> the slope failure mechanism, progressive failure process and final failure pattern can be studied. Moreover, the stability safety factors can be evaluated according to displacement data monitored by sensors installed in the geomechanical model. The geomechanical <b>model</b> <b>test</b> of the Jinping left-bank slope reveals that the bending and toppling cracks occur simultaneously in the unreinforced zone of the slope together with strong relaxation and tension cracks. It is found that the factor controlling the rock mass failure and instability is the structurally weak rock mass and the dominant failure mode is the integral catastrophic instability mode, in which the slope energy is totally dissipated and the slope destabilizes at a limit state. The reinforcement installed in the large area above the elevation of the dam-slope abutment and the unloading action due to the excavation of rocks lying above the dam platform have effectively improved the anti-slide safety factor of the slope, and thus increased its inherent safety factor. On the basis of the geomechanical <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> results and their comparisons with field monitoring results, it is concluded that the installed rock bolts and long anchor reinforcement measures are very effective in keeping the cracks closed in the rock mass and maintaining the slope stability...|$|R
