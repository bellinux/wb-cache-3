500|$|After being {{released}} from St Luke's, Smart {{was taken to a}} private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was [...] "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green". She described her experience as being held in a [...] "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not [...] "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: [...] "For they work on <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: [...] "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." [...] It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space" [...] from being watched by outsiders.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Loretta was {{created as a}} temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In 2009 {{it was announced that}} the Hollyoaks producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show. Allan said, [...] "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly." [...] Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear. She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: [...] "I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put up in my living room." ...|$|E

500|$|Lambert {{shared his}} {{interests}} {{and knowledge of}} sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having {{the air of a}} fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> company." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that {{if it came to}} a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Born in {{the small}} town of Leslie, Michigan, she later moved with her family to St. Johns, Michigan, where she lived with her unhappily married parents in extreme poverty. Her father, August de Cleyre, named her after the famed French Enlightenment author Voltaire. At age 12, she was placed into a Catholic convent in Sarnia, Ontario, by her father, because he thought it would give her a better education. This {{experience}} had the effect of moving her towards atheism rather than Christianity. Of her time spent there she said, [...] "it had been like the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and there are white scars on my soul, where ignorance and superstition burnt <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> hell fire in those stifling days". She attempted to run away by swimming to Port Huron, Michigan, and hiking but she met friends of her family who contacted her father and sent her back.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900, de Creeft {{moved to}} Madrid and {{studied in the}} {{workshop}} of Don Augustin Querol Subirats, Official Sculptor of Spain. This was de Creeft’s first experience with stone carving. [...] He also studied drawing with Rafael Hidalgo and Gutierrez de Caviedes, [...] and sculpture with Ignacio Zuloaga. The following year {{he worked as a}} draftsman for the Madrid Administration of Bridges and Roads, where he learned perspective and precision drawing. In 1902, he opened his first studio with a friend on [...] "Calle Españoletto". At this time he observed the art work of a group of Eskimos (Inuit) in El Retiro Park which {{had a profound impact on}} his developing aesthetic. “The Eskimos impressed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> simplicity and their directness of expression. With tiny pieces of ivory they made monumental sculptures that had strength, power and serenity, though they were less than hand-sized.” [...] A year later, his first exhibition of portraits of children in clay and plaster was held at El Circulo de Bellas Artes in Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1875 Leskov went abroad, first to Paris, then to Prague and Dresden in August. In December his story [...] "At the Edge of the World" [...] was {{published}} in Grazhdanin (1875, No. 52). All the while he continued {{to work on a}} set of stories which would later form his cycle Virtuous Ones. Some critics found Leskov's heroes virtuous beyond belief, but he insisted they were not fantasies, but more like reminiscences of his earlier encounters. [...] "I credit myself with having some ability for analyzing characters and their motives, but I'm hopless at fantasizing. Making up things is hard labour for me, so I've always felt the need for having before me real faces which could intrigue <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> spirituality; then they get hold of me and I infuse them with new life, using some real-life stories as a basis," [...] he wrote later in the Varshavsky Dnevnik newspaper. Years of confrontation with critics and many of his colleagues have taken their toll. [...] "Men of letters seem to recognize my writing as a force, but find great pleasure in killing it; in fact they have all but succeeded in killing it off altogether. I write nothing – I just can't!", he wrote to Pyotr Schebalsky in January 1876.|$|E
