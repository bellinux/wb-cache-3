40|$|We present {{two related}} methods for {{creating}} MasterPrints, synthetic fingerprints that {{are capable of}} spoofing multiple people's fingerprints. These methods achieve results that advance the state-of-the-art for single <b>MasterPrint</b> attack accuracy while being the first methods capable of creating MasterPrints at the image level. Both of the methods presented in this paper start with training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on a set of real fingerprint images. The generator network is then used to search for fingerprints that maximize the probability of matching with most subjects in a dataset. The first method uses evolutionary search in the space of latent variables, and the second method uses gradient-based optimization. The unique combination of evolution and GANs is able to design a <b>MasterPrint</b> that a commercial fingerprint system matches to 23 % of all users in a strict security setting, and 77 % of all users at a looser security setting.
