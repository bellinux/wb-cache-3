500|$|In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby {{was past}} his prime. Among the reasons, [...] "making {{spokesman}} commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He {{has evolved into}} a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been". [...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't <b>mind</b> <b>your</b> commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man... I'm proving that all men are brothers." ...|$|E

Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton.

2500|$|An only child, strange-looking and eccentric, Stevenson {{found it}} hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age six, a problem {{repeated}} at age eleven when he went on to the Edinburgh Academy; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at Colinton. In any case, his frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, first learning at age seven or eight, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse. He compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father found them and told him to [...] "give up such nonsense and <b>mind</b> <b>your</b> business." [...] He paid for the printing of Robert's first publication at sixteen, an account of the Covenanters' rebellion, which was published on its two hundredth anniversary, The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666 (1866).|$|E
2500|$|After much {{personal}} {{struggle and}} a turbulent on-off engagement, he married the Chilean-born American actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre on September 10, 1951. One {{suggestion is that}} he chose to marry partly to dispel rumors about his private life to help secure a major conducting appointment, following advice from his mentor Dimitri Mitropoulos about the conservative nature of orchestra boards. In a book released in October 2013, The Leonard Bernstein Letters, his wife reveals his homosexuality. Felicia writes: [...] "you are a homosexual and may never change—you don’t admit {{to the possibility of}} a double life, but if your peace of <b>mind,</b> <b>your</b> health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?" [...] Arthur Laurents (Bernstein's collaborator in West Side Story) said that Bernstein was [...] "a gay man who got married. He wasn't conflicted about it at all. He was just gay." [...] Shirley Rhoades Perle, another friend of Bernstein, said that she thought [...] "he required men sexually and women emotionally." [...] But the early years of his marriage seem to have been happy, and no one has suggested Bernstein and his wife didn't love each other. They had three children, Jamie, Alexander, and later Nina. There are reports, though, that Bernstein did sometimes have brief extramarital liaisons with young men, which several family friends have said his wife knew about.|$|E
