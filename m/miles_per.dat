5|$|June 5–6- Tropical Storm Andrea, with {{sustained}} {{winds of}} 60 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour, brought heavy rains and wind gusts up to 48 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> {{hour in the}} central part of the state, including the Tampa and Miami areas. Andrea is believed to have produced at least one tornado in West Palm Beach.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E

Stunt driver Steve Kelso drove the SUV when it crashed into Tony's car, {{reportedly}} driving at 50 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour, though bloggers indicated that they thought that the car looked more {{like it was going}} 80 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour.|$|E
50|$|Freight {{also made}} a {{significant}} part of the traffic on the canal. Basin dues were set at 2 pence per ton. Stone, dung and earth were charged at 2 pence <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> ton; coal, coke culm and lime were 3 pence <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> ton; Bricks, tiles, slates, orers, iron and metal were rated at 5 pence <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> ton; and all other goods were charged 2 pence <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> ton. In 1840, the canal handled 76000 LT of goods.|$|R

5|$|With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow {{turn to the}} north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a {{small group}} of islands {{populated}} only by a United States military base. The storm slowly weakened from its peak as a Category 5 hurricane in the face of increasing shear, dropping down to a Category 1 hurricane with 90 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour (145 km/h) maximum winds. On August 25 local time, John made its closest approach to the Johnston Atoll only 15 miles (24 km) to the north. On Johnston Atoll, sustained winds were reported up to 60 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour (95 km/h), the equivalent of a strong tropical storm, and gusts up to 75 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour (120 km/h) were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves <b>Miles</b> <b>per</b> Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs. As the trains will therefore {{be in the}} depot less, it will allow South West Trains to acquire additional rolling stock without the {{need to build a}} new depot.|$|E
5|$|Flies have rapid {{reflexes}} {{that aid}} their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid {{flies in the}} genus Condylostylus respond in less than 5 milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, Cephenemyia, was claimed {{to be one of}} the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour, was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> hour.|$|E

However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E
