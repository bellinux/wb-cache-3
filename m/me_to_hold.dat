500|$|Sullivan {{insisted that}} the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert {{did not feel that}} he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a {{compromise}} that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as [...] "this seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out great chances of bright colour and taking music." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> my line, so I knew I was exactly where I needed to be".|$|E
500|$|Despite Booth's views {{being more}} genteel {{than that of}} most of his teammates, there was minimal {{friction}} or disconnect. Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a Melbourne Cup gambling sweep organised by captain Keith Miller. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him {{to look after the}} money. Booth said [...] "That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team." [...] He added [...] "The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> them." [...] Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.|$|E
60|$|The {{fever and}} remorse alone have given <b>me</b> {{strength}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the pen. My hands are quite numbed now. I can write no longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had about}} given you up, Mr. Brice," [...] he said. [...] "Mr. Lincoln asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get <b>hold</b> of you, and bring you to him alive or dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --She too wants <b>me</b> <b>to</b> catch <b>hold</b> of her, he thought. That's why {{she came}} with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the tram. I could easily catch {{hold of her}} when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her.|$|R
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{claim was}} struck out in February 1998 by High Court {{official}} Master Hodgson who ruled that Armstrong {{had made no}} direct threat against Palmer and her family. He said: [...] "In {{the absence of such}} a specific threat I think it is impossible, as the law currently stands, for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> that the hospital in these circumstances owes effectively a duty (of care) to the world at large." [...] In June 1999 the case was heard again at the Court of Appeal. On 1 July 1999 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith upheld the previous High Court ruling that there was no connection between the health authority or the hospital and Palmer.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert {{offered a}} {{compromise}} that Sullivan ultimately accepted [...] that the composer would write a light opera for the Savoy, and a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing for that purpose. Sullivan's acceptance came {{with the proviso that}} [...] "we are thoroughly agreed upon the subject." [...] Gilbert suggested an opera based on a theatrical company, which Sullivan rejected (though a version of it would be resurrected in 1896 as The Grand Duke), but he accepted an idea [...] "connected with Venice and Venetian life, and this seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out great chances of bright colour and taking music. Can you not develop this with something we can both go into with warmth and enthusiasm and thus give me a subject in which (like the Mikado and Patience) we can both be interested....?" ...|$|E
60|$|The girovago talked continually. He turned <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>holding</b> {{the handful}} of sausages.|$|R
6000|$|... "My submission," [...] she said, [...] "only {{respected}} those {{lands and}} estates which your Grace's ancestors gave to mine, and which I resign to the House of Burgundy, if my Sovereign thinks my disobedience {{in this matter}} renders <b>me</b> unworthy <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that forces}} {{me out of}} {{business}} for the time being, Ogilvie. I'll have to look around a little {{and see if it}} is worth while for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take <b>hold</b> elsewhere. I presume all the really good claims around here have been covered." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Crazy Horse and I {{left the}} crowd and rode down along the river. We came to a ravine, then we {{followed}} up the gulch to {{a place in the}} rear of the soldiers that were making the stand on the hill. Crazy Horse gave his horse to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> along with my horse. He crawled up the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as fast as he could load his gun. They fell off their horses as fast as he could shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{disappeared}} in the crowd. I went on. A woman asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> her palm branch, and then SHE disappeared. A girl got <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> her harp for her, and by George, SHE disappeared; {{and so on and}} so on, till I was about loaded down to the guards. Then comes a smiling old gentleman and asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> HIS things. I swabbed off the perspiration and says, pretty tart-- ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. You see my project; his man Fabio is bribed by <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> him in discourse.|$|E
5000|$|Oh Lord, if {{you hear}} <b>me,</b> please <b>hold</b> <b>to</b> my hand, oh please understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the same}} thing. But I might ride, and Effie might give <b>me</b> her hand <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{over the side}} of the carriage; that would sustain me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we did our}} best," [...] {{answered}} Fred. [...] "And believe <b>me,</b> it's something <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> down {{a school}} like Hixley with such a pitcher as Dink Wilsey." ...|$|R
60|$|ZOO. Dissolve? In what? [Thunder]. Oh! My fault this time. That {{means that}} the oracle understands you, and desires <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> my tongue.|$|E

6000|$|As she spoke, {{a second}} {{door in the}} room was opened. An old woman showed herself for a moment, {{trembling}} with terror. [...] "He's breaking out again, nurse! Help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long as {{it leaves}} <b>me</b> still able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up my head," [...] he murmured. [...] "Mrs. Honeywell struck me as being rather severe in her strictures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not at all. It's {{all right}} now. I couldn't explain {{very well that}} I hadn't come to the city just {{to be in the}} city, but because I had to do {{something}} to help along at home. You didn't seem to understand that there wa'n't anything there for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take <b>hold</b> of." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stood in}} my mind for goodness--and for things from which it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> my <b>hold</b> was slipping.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heer, Adrian," [...] said Martin, [...] "you {{have the}} {{cross-bow}} and the bolts, and {{you used to}} be the best shot of all three of us; will you help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the causeway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentleman {{rushed into}} the Exhibition, sir!" [...] said an {{official}} in a dazed manner. Then he added in an injured voice: [...] "Funny gentleman, sir. Asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> his horse, and gave me this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, it'll rest <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{that little}} chap. I'm all right. My hands is frosted some, an' my ears, that's all, but my breath is gittin' back. Come on, now," [...] he pleaded.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's Heckewelder {{walking with}} old man Wells," [...] whispered Jonathan. [...] "There's Young and Edwards, and, yes, there's the young missionary, brother of Joe. 'Pears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> they're foolish <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{service in the}} face of all those riled Injuns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{but a small}} {{matter to}} you," [...] rejoined Nicolaes, [...] "but it would be of great service <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I desire <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> private {{conversation}} with this gentleman. Could I do so in your house without attracting anybody's attention?" ...|$|R
60|$|As birds {{within the}} same country vary in a remarkably small degree, I have {{particularly}} attended to them, and the rule seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> certainly <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> good in this class. I cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bender hereupon at last {{gave himself}} quite gaily away {{as to his}} high {{calculation}} of impunity. [...] "Well, I guess he won't struggle too hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on to him if I want to!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it! First it left [...] The {{yellowing}} fennel, run to seed [...] There, branching {{from the}} brickwork's cleft, [...] Some old tomb's ruin; yonder weed [...] Took up the floating weft, [...] 15 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honesty, sir! It {{is hard to}} {{say what}} is honesty and what is dishonesty. Would you believe it, Mr. Mason, only last night I had a {{thousand}} pounds offered <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> my tongue about this affair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a fool}} {{business}} pickin' her up in {{the first}} place, 'cause if you never'd done it, them lawyers couldn't say you had a kid with you.

6000|$|She {{really had}} not the least notion that a wetting ruined their crops; and when I would have answered, my godmother and mother made <b>me</b> a sign <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> my tongue, while Queen Henrietta spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they come}} up close, papa, I might take the helm, if you show <b>me</b> which way <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it. I could do it sitting down on deck, and you could help Rupert keep them off." ...|$|R
