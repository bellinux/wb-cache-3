30|$|Before implant insertion, {{especially}} in oncoplastic breast reconstruction, a tissue expander (Fig.  1) is usually {{placed in the}} mastectomy site to stretch the remaining skin {{in preparation for the}} placement of a permanent implant later. The expander is like an inflatable breast implant that is inserted into a pocket under the skin and muscle of the chest. The expander is usually placed in its collapsed form at the time of mastectomy and then, after surgery, fluid is introduced into the tissue expander to slowly inflate it. It is important to realise that, as their function is to expand, they might not be fully inflated and thus may appear to have <b>multiple</b> <b>folds</b> <b>or</b> wrinkles on the surface. This should not be interpreted as rupture [10]. Depending on the type of expander, the fluid is either introduced directly into the expander (magnetic marker) or is injected into a distant port. This process continues for several weeks until the tissue expander is filled to an optimal volume, when a permanent breast implant can be inserted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a new variant of successive cancellation decoder (SCD) for polar codes {{based on the}} concept of folding, which was proposed in [1], [2] as technique to reduce the decoding latency at the cost of a higher computational complexity. In this paper, we first formally define the <b>multiple</b> <b>folding</b> operation (iterated κ times), which decomposes the original encoding graph into a number of smaller polar encoding graphs. More specifically, we show that the <b>multiple</b> <b>folding</b> gives rise to a two stage interpretation of the graph representing the polar encoder and the SCD. Based on this, we propose the improved <b>multiple</b> <b>folded</b> successive cancellation decoder (IMFSCD), which combines SCD in one stage and maximum-likelihood decoding in the other. This decoder exhibits a latency gain by a factor of 2 κ, still retaining a complexity close to the classic SCD. The small increase in complexity is due to a short maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) used in place of a SCD in the last decoding stage within the IMFSCD. Moreover, we observe by simulation that the decoder exhibits a significant performance gain at high rates and longer codes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD), a classical simulation method, captures the essential physics of protein dynamics. That idea {{is supported by}} a theoretical study showing that various MD force-fields provide a consensus picture of protein fluctuations in aqueous solution [Rueda, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007, 104, 796 − 801]. However, atomistic MD cannot be applied to most biologically relevant processes due to its limitation to relatively short time scales. Much longer time scales can be accessed by properly designed coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the aforementioned consensus view of protein dynamics from short (nanosecond) time scale MD simulations is fairly consistent with the dynamics of the coarse-grained protein model- the CABS model. The CABS model employs stochastic dynamics (a Monte Carlo method) and a knowledge-based force-field, which is not biased toward the native structure of a simulated protein. Since CABS-based dynamics allows for the simulation of entire <b>folding</b> (<b>or</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>folding</b> events) in a single run, integration of the CABS approach with all-atom MD promises a convenient (and computationally feasible) means for the long-time multiscale molecular modeling of protein systems with atomistic resolution. 1...|$|R
