5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to}} be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> internal to the body (internalism) or the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Semantic externalism {{holds that}} the {{semantic}} content of the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> totally or partially defined by state of affairs external {{to the body of}} the subject. Hilary Putnam's Twin earth thought experiment is a good example.|$|E

5|$|Confessions of a Dangerous <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> a 2002 biographical spy comedy film {{depicting}} {{the life of}} popular game show host and producer Chuck Barris, {{who claimed to have}} also been an assassin for the CIA. The film was George Clooney's directorial debut, was written by Charlie Kaufman, and starred Sam Rockwell, Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, and Clooney.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E

A sufferer from stomach-trouble or one who is otherwise in pain and cannot concentrate his <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> also exempt. One who is engaged {{in the study of the}} Law and scribes of and dealers in tefillin and mezuzot while engaged in their work if it cannot be postponed, are also free from this obligation.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|After the Black Order is rebuilt, Lenalee and {{her friends}} learn Allen is the vessel of the 14th Noah; {{eventually}} the Noah will control his body forcing the other exorcists to kill him if he becomes a Noah. Later, when Allen is imprisoned because of his transformations and escapes from the Order {{with the other two}} Noah, Lenalee tries to make him return. However, she fails as Allen confirms he still considers the Order his home before his departure. Three months later, Lenalee tries to conceal Yu Kanda's journey to find Allen from Komui. When Allen's <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> about to disappear from his body {{as a result of the}} Noah, Lenalee appears in an illusion allowing him to regain his desire to live.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|... (c) The {{experiences}} {{of a given}} person are necessarily private to that person. The contents of one's <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> the only things one has direct access to. One cannot get ‘outside’ of one's mind to encounter any other objects including other persons. Other <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> even more removed.|$|R
40|$|Are minds really {{dynamical}} or {{are they}} really symbolic? Because <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> bundles of computations, and because computation is always a matter of interpretation of one system by another, <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> necessarily symbolic. Because minds, along with {{everything else in the}} universe, are physical, and insofar as the laws of physics <b>are</b> dynamical, <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> necessarily dynamical systems. Thus, the short answer to the opening question is “yes. ” It makes sense to ask further whether some of the computations that constitute a human <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> constrained by functional, algorithmic, or implementational factors to be essentially of the discrete symbolic variety (even if they supervene on an apparently continuous dynamical substrate). I suggest that here too the answer is “yes” and discuss the need for such discrete, symbolic cognitive computations in communication-related tasks...|$|R

5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{author has}} {{attenuated}} Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) {{until there was}} not a single saline property left... and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the <b>mind</b> <b>is,</b> the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
