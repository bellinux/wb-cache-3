5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The <b>mean</b> <b>size</b> of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E

A comprehensive system recently reported by Ding & Riediker (2015) is able to maintain robust aerosolization process and generate aerosols with stable number concentration and <b>mean</b> <b>size</b> from nano-powders. The deagglomeration potential of various airborne nanomaterials can be also studied using critical orifices. This process was also investigated by Stahlmecke et al. (2009). In addition, an impact fragmentation device was developed to investigate bonding energies between particles.|$|E
25|$|Pacific salmon are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, Pacific salmon have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of Pacific salmon. As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In Japanese Chum Salmon, for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the harvesting of salmon populations. Salmon of larger body weight are more apt to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, Pacific salmon have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for Pacific salmon a larger <b>mean</b> <b>size</b> at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in Pacific salmon is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout Pacific salmon species. Today, it seems that population numbers of Pacific salmon are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|E

Release kinetic models were used to simulate and elucidate release kinetics and mechanisms of curcumin from CBs under specific conditions. The loading capacity and efficiency of curcumin onto CBs could be enhanced via the optimization of curcumin solution concentration and the morphological characteristics of CBs, whereas the release kinetic profiles of curcumin from CBs could be modulated by varying the mean diameter of CBs. Optimized CBs derived from regenerated cellulose of paper wastes are potentially useful as cost-effective drug delivery carriers...|$|R

Materials and Methods: The data from 171 patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy for a renal tumor at Ajou University Hospital were reviewed. Radiologic tumor size, which {{was defined as the}} largest diameter on a computed tomographic scan, was compared with pathologic tumor size, which was defined as the largest diameter on gross pathologic examination. Results: <b>Mean</b> radiologic <b>size</b> was significantly larger than <b>mean</b> pathologic <b>size</b> for all tumors (p= 0. 019). When stratified according to radiologic <b>size</b> range, <b>mean</b> radio-logic <b>size</b> was significantly larger than <b>mean</b> pathologic <b>size</b> for tumors ＜ 4 cm (p= 0. 003), but {{there was no significant difference}} between the sizes for tumors 4 – 7 cm and ＞ 7 cm. When classified according to histologic subtype, <b>mean</b> radiologic <b>size</b> was significantly larger than <b>mean</b> pathologic <b>size</b> only in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (p= 0. 002). When classified according to tumor location, <b>mean</b> radiologic <b>size</b> was sig-nificantly larger than <b>mean</b> pathologic <b>size</b> in endophytic tumors (p= 0. 043) but not in exophytic tumors.
