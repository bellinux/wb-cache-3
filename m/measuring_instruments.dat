25|$|Broca {{first became}} acquainted with {{anthropology}} through {{the works of}} Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805–1861), Antoine Étienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786–1868) and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau (1810–1892), and anthropology soon became his lifetime interest. He spent much time at his Anthropological Institute, studying skulls and bones, and vigorously attempting to use the measurements obtained by these studies as his main criteria for ranking racial groups in order of superiority. In that sense, Broca was {{a pioneer in the}} study of physical anthropology and scientific racism. He advanced the science of cranial anthropometry by developing many new types of <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> (craniometers) and numerical indices.|$|E
25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E
25|$|Laser diodes find wide use in {{telecommunication}} {{as easily}} modulated and easily coupled light sources for fiber optics communication. They {{are used in}} various <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> such as rangefinders. Another common use is in barcode readers. Visible lasers, typically red but later also green, are common as laser pointers. Both low and high-power diodes are used extensively in the printing industry both as light sources for scanning (input) of images and for very high-speed and high-resolution printing plate (output) manufacturing. Infrared and red laser diodes are common in CD players, CD-ROMs and DVD technology. Violet lasers are used in HD DVD and Blu-ray technology. Diode lasers have also found many applications in laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) for high-speed, low-cost assessment or monitoring of the concentration of various species in gas phase. High-power laser diodes are used in industrial applications such as heat treating, cladding, seam welding and for pumping other lasers, such as diode-pumped solid-state lasers.|$|E

500|$|Interferometers {{are widely}} used in science and {{industry}} for the measurement of small displacements, refractive index changes and surface irregularities. [...] In an interferometer, light from a single source is split into two beams that travel different optical paths, then combined again to produce interference. [...] The resulting interference fringes give information about the difference in optical path length. [...] In analytical science, interferometers are used to measure lengths and the shape of optical components with nanometer precision; they are the highest precision length <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> existing. [...] In Fourier transform spectroscopy {{they are used to}} analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with a substance or mixture. [...] An astronomical interferometer consists of two or more separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation between its individual elements.|$|E

500|$|The {{skull of}} the spotted hyena {{differs from that}} of the striped hyena by its much greater size and {{narrower}} sagittal crest. For its size, the spotted hyena {{has one of the most}} powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third premolars are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in²), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate. The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the brown bear in bonecrushing ability, and free ranging hyenas have been observed to crack open the long bones of giraffes measuring 7cm in diameter. A [...] spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocone. One individual in a study was found to exert a bite force of 4,500 newtons on the <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
