40|$|Abstract: Stepped <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> <b>spillways</b> are circle {{sections}} generally {{used for}} discharging floods of earth dams. These spillways passes more flow discharges through themselves {{in comparison with}} smooth spillways. Therefore, the risk of flow pressure decrease to less than fluid vapor pressure called cavitation should be prevented as far as possible. At this study, it has been tried to study cavitation from the view point {{of the effects of}} flow regime changes on spillway, changes of step dimensions and the change of number of steps. Therefore, five spillway models (one smooth spillway and four stepped spillways) have been used to assess the cavitation risk. With regard to the inlet discharge to spillway, the parameters of pressure and flow velocity on spillway surface have been measures at several points and after fulfillment of tests, the cavitation risk in spillways in comparison with the dimensionless parameter of Froude number at different points of the spillway, height to width of the step (h/b), number of steps as well as the distance {{from the beginning of the}} spillway have been measured theoretically and in the form of a diagram for all the five spillway types. Results indicated that the best type of spillway in regard to design and resistance against cavitation risk and concrete erosion is the second type (eleven-stepped spillway) with regression index over 99 %. Besides, some equations have been developed for designing the steps dimensions based upon flow regime for the second type spillway using regression analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Morning glory spillways are {{the type}} of spillways used where there is not {{adequate}} space to build other types of spillways to discharge flood water from reservoirs downslope dams, because morning glory spillways are placed upslope dams and inside dam reservoirs. In our study, we investigated the effect of polyhedral spillway crests on the discharge intensity of the flow passing through the spillways and on the discharge coefficient of morning glory spillways, by constructing physical hydraulic models of morning glory spillways and through carrying out 180 different experiments on these spillways. Analysis of experimental data showed that using polyhedral spillway crests caused an increase in discharge passing through the <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> <b>spillway</b> and also increased the discharge coefficient of the spillway. The greatest increase was obtained when trihedral spillway crests were used.

40|$|The closed conduit {{spillway}} is any conduit {{having a}} closed cross section through which water is spilled. The inlet and outlet {{may be of}} any type. The barrel may be of any size or shape and may flow either full or partly full. Also, the barrel may be on any slope. This broad definition includes the smallest culvert {{as well as the}} largest <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> <b>spillway.</b> The basic theory of the flow is the same for each of the many forms which the spillway may take. This paper discusses the control of the flow through closed conduit spillways by weirs, the barrel exit, tailwater, pipe, orifice, and short tube, since each of these controls may govern, at some time or other, the rate of flow through the spillway. The effect of these various controls on the performance of the spillway is explained. A means of developing a composite head-discharge curve is given. Pressures within the closed conduit spillway must sometimes be determined, so the methods for this determination are presented. A selected bibliography useful to the understanding and for the design of closed conduit spillways concludes this technical paper.
