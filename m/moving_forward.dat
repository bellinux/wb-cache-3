5|$|In 2007, the {{brothers}} spoke to director Stephen Hopkins about <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> with an adaptation again, {{but it became}} stuck in development hell. The Lunas were still in talks for an Ultra television project in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I, a short novel set {{immediately}} after XIII, shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage.

50|$|The front {{stance is}} {{normally}} used when <b>moving</b> <b>forwards</b> while back stance is used when moving backwards.|$|R
50|$|Front {{drum brakes}} {{may be of}} either design in practice, but the twin leading design is more effective. This design uses two {{actuating}} cylinders arranged so that both shoes use the self-applying characteristic when the vehicle is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards.</b> The brake shoes pivot at opposite points to each other. This gives the maximum possible braking when <b>moving</b> <b>forwards,</b> but is not so effective when the vehicle is traveling in reverse.|$|R
5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|While Terminator Salvation was {{initially}} intended {{to begin a}} new trilogy, production of a fifth film was halted by legal trouble, as well as The Halcyon Company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. While some anonymous sources insisted that Terminator 5 would be <b>moving</b> <b>forward,</b> the majority of analysts predicted that its future was in jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced {{back and the}} Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but were unable to break the British line. They dug in and waited for tank support before <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night.|$|E

5|$|Bush became {{dissatisfied}} with Colonel Marshall's failure {{to get the}} project <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army {{and the location of}} his headquarters in New York City. Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E
5|$|In late 2012, Seeley and Norton were {{approached}} {{by more than}} one major network to develop Revival into a television series. The deal fell through when ABC Studios announced they were <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> with a different property that dealt with similar themes. A film adaptation was announced in early 2017. It will be co-written by Seeley and produced by Shatterglass Films. Diamond Select Toys has released a minimate toy of Em Cypress.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the bilaterian body plan follows from this hypothesis; the urbilaterian would develop its symmetry as {{one end of the}} placula became adapted for <b>moving</b> <b>forwards,</b> which would result in a left-right symmetry.|$|R
2500|$|Arrows: Some tread {{designs are}} [...] "directional", and {{designed}} to perform better when driven in a specific direction. Such tires will have an arrow showing which way the tire should rotate when the vehicle is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{plan to take}} Bapaume {{involved}} the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Grévillers, moving {{to the south of}} Bapaume with the 63rd Division <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move {{to the north of the}} town. Its left flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to envelop Bapaume and force the Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|This victory {{contributed to}} a general Allied {{breakthrough}} in the area, and by 19 April, the 6th Division's armour was moving towards Lombardy and Venetia {{as part of the}} Fifth Army's vanguard. American and Polish troops entered Bologna on 21 April. The South Africans and Rhodesians advanced north-west towards the Panaro river. The Special Service Battalion's Rhodesian squadron, <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> alongside the Cape Town Highlanders, and the Rhodesians of Prince Alfred's Guard took part in numerous engagements with the retreating German rearguard, and suffered several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Moon's perigee is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards</b> or precessing in {{its orbit}} {{and makes a}} {{complete}} circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month.|$|R

2500|$|The bow {{also had}} a {{balanced}} two-bladed rudder fitted into it, which could be retracted into the hull, that allowed the ship to be manoeuvrable when going astern. It also slightly reduced {{the diameter of the}} turning circle (by 12 percent) when the ship was <b>moving</b> <b>forwards.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thompson {{competed in}} the second heat during the August 16 {{semifinal}} round. He finished the race in 9.93seconds, placing second out of eight athletes. Jamaica's Asafa Powell took first (9.91seconds), and Churandy Martina took third (9.94seconds). Thompson placed third out of the sixteen semifinalists, <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> to the final round. Richard Thompson completed the final race in 9.89seconds and medaled silver. In the event, Bolt medaled gold with a world and Olympic record-breaking 9.69seconds, and Walter Dix medaled bronze {{with a time of}} 9.91seconds.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they did}} not need to deploy the amber, Walter realizes how close he was to making the same {{decisions}} that Walternate (Noble), Walter's doppelganger in the parallel universe, had to make to save his universe; Nina (Blair Brown) helps to counsel him. Meanwhile, Olivia and Peter attempt to reconcile and rekindle their relationship. Though still cautious about <b>moving</b> <b>forward,</b> Olivia and Peter kiss and head to the bedroom upstairs at the Bishops' home.|$|E
5|$|Ajax kidnaps her {{and takes}} {{her to a}} {{decommissioned}} helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him rescue Vanessa. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but reveals {{that there is no}} cure after Deadpool overpowers him. Despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills Ajax, though he promises to try and be more heroic <b>moving</b> <b>forward.</b> Though Vanessa is angry at Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.|$|E
50|$|A {{drive wheel}} is a {{wheel of a}} motor vehicle that transmits force, {{transforming}} torque into tractive force from the tires to the road, causing the vehicle to move. The powertrain delivers enough torque to the wheel to overcome stationary forces, resulting in the vehicle <b>moving</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards.|$|R
50|$|However, in the meantime, NATO is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards</b> {{with a plan}} {{to upgrade}} its {{tactical}} nuclear weapons with precision guidance that would make them equivalent to strategic weapons in effects against hardened targets, and to carry them on stealth aircraft that are much more survivable against current air defenses.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the rest}} of Europe is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards,</b> this last {{dictatorship}} in Europe is trying to push its homosexual community into a 1930s Nazi style concentration camp", says Schiller.

5|$|At 03:50 on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge began. The {{division}} {{was ordered to}} capture the German front line, the second line positions based on Pilckem Ridge, a low ridge that also contained the heavily shelled village of Pilckem, followed by Iron Cross Ridge which lay to the east, before storming {{down the other side}} and across a small stream known as the Steenbeck. The division would be opposed primarily by the German 3rd Guards Infantry Division, along with elements of the 3rd Reserve Division and 111th Division, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete pillboxes and bunkers. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack in waves, with fresh troops constantly <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> to tackle the next objective.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, York Region was <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> {{with plans}} to expand Green Lane into a four lane road, while the {{province}} was urged to consider extending Highway404 north to it, and eventually around {{the east side of}} Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan called for an extension of Highway404 north to Green Lane, and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive outside town, to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
50|$|The optimum {{arrangement}} of twin leading front brakes with leading/trailing brakes {{on the rear}} allows more braking force {{at the front of}} the vehicle when it is <b>moving</b> <b>forwards,</b> with less at the rear. This helps prevent the rear wheels from locking up, but still provides adequate braking at the rear.|$|R
