5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still <b>music</b> <b>making</b> the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} {{population}} exchange between Greece and Turkey, many ethnic Greeks from Asia Minor fled to Athens {{as a result}} of the Greco-Turkish War. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them Rebetiko <b>music,</b> <b>making</b> it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the Laïko music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika. Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} works cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are Pastoral Concert (c. 1510, The Louvre) and The Tempest (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), {{both of which}} are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; {{the relationship between the two}} figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in <b>music</b> <b>making,</b> while a second nude woman stands beside them.|$|E
25|$|The British R bands {{produced}} music {{which was}} very different in tone from that of African-American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They {{have been criticized for}} exploiting the massive catalogue of African-American music, but it has also been noted that they both popularized that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helped to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. Most of these bands rapidly moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music, often leaving their R roots behind. Many helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive and hard rock, having a major influence on the nature and sound of rock <b>music,</b> <b>making</b> rhythm and blues a major component of its sound.|$|E

25|$|For each year, Miller {{wrote about}} ten {{or more of}} his {{favorite}} songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era. Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life, and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for {{what was then the}} last 50 years of recorded music. The writing process started in 2006, when Miller took a hiatus from <b>music</b> <b>making</b> after the release of What If It Works?. Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.|$|E
25|$|The USC Thornton School of Music {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly {{regarded}} music schools in the United States. The training at the Thornton School frequently draws graduate students from such institutions including Juilliard, Oberlin College, Rice, and the Eastman School of Music; and graduates of the Thornton School often go on to study at these and other institutions, such as the Colburn School, the Curtis Institute of Music, or the Manhattan School of Music. The most active source of live music in all of Los Angeles, the Thornton School offers everything from medieval music to current music. In addition to the departments of classical music, there is a department for popular music and even a department of early <b>music,</b> <b>making</b> USC's music school one of the few in the United States that offers specialized degrees in pre-classical music.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile the {{majority}} of the capitular canons had adopted Lutheranism and elected fellow faithful to eventual vacancies. The cathedral reopened as Lutheran place of worship in 1540. The disputes on capitular estates were regulated by the Bremen Settlement in 1561. The church turned into a Lutheran proto-cathedral and the remaining endowment allowed financing excellent ecclesiastical <b>music,</b> <b>making</b> the proto-cathedral a frequented venue for Lutheran services accompanied by music. The incumbents of the Bremen See used to be themselves Lutherans since the accession of Administrator Henry of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1569. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 transformed the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, an elective monarchy, into the hereditary monarchy of the Duchy of Bremen, in personal union with Sweden until 1712/15, since 1715 with the House of Hanover. Thus the immunity district turned into a ducal Bremian enclave in the city.|$|E

25|$|Byrd's {{acquaintance}} with the Petre family extended {{back at least}} to 1581 (as his surviving autograph letter of that year shows) and he spent two weeks at the Petre household over Christmas in 1589. He was ideally equipped to provide elaborate polyphony to adorn the <b>music</b> <b>making</b> at the Catholic country houses of the time. The continued adherence of Byrd and his family to Catholicism continued to cause him difficulties, though a surviving reference to a lost petition apparently written by Byrd to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury sometime between 1605 and 1612 suggests that he had been allowed to practise his religion under licence during the reign of Elizabeth. Nevertheless, he regularly appeared in the quarterly local assizes and was reported to the archdeaconry court for non-attendance at the parish church. He was required to pay heavy fines for recusancy. No doubt his wide circle of friends and patrons among the nobility and gentry were able to ensure that he escaped more severe penalties.|$|E
25|$|Seah {{began her}} formal music {{training}} on the piano with her mother Lau Biau Chin, when she was five. She started the violin {{at the age of}} six with Goh Soon Tioe and later professional violin teacher in Singapore, Alphonso Anthony. At the age of 21 she began her career as a music teacher with the Yamaha music school teaching piano and violin to children. She found little fulfilment working as a music teacher, as she was well-aware that she is more of a performer than a teacher. When the Singapore Symphony Orchestra was set up in 1979, she applied for a position with the group and came through as a full-time performer – the only full-time staff of the arts group. Two days before the inaugural concert, the Musical Director Choo Hoey approached her to be the concertmaster of the upcoming performance, leading the first violin section and taking charge of the technical aspects of the orchestra's <b>music</b> <b>making</b> for SSO's first concert.|$|E
25|$|Music {{theory as}} a {{practical}} discipline encompasses the methods and concepts composers and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense {{may be found in}} oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from Mesopotamia, China, and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see History of music and Musical instrument). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current <b>music</b> <b>making.</b> Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.|$|E
