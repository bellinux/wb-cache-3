40|$|It is the {{intention}} of this dissertation to provide a 'theory' of African American religious experience that is guided by postmodern critical thought, with particular emphasis on methodologies attempting to grasp what {{is referred to as}} the quotidian, the ordinary, but primarily as "everyday life. " It is my contention that this constitutes a promising approach that African American religionists should consider. Indeed, for almost forty years, there has been one dominant interpretative lens for the study of African American religious experience, often referred to as a hermeneutics of liberation. It is my contention that this orientation, with its emphasis on the macroscopic, is <b>markedly</b> <b>inadequate.</b> I maintain that what is needed is a focus on the microscopic. Moreover, I also assert that if there is to be a locus for opposition to oppression, it is to be found on the level of the "everyday" [...] - that which is often passed over as insignificant or irrelevant...|$|E
40|$|The {{adequacy}} of retrograde delivery of cardioplegic {{solution to the}} right ventricle ist controversial. To evaluate this issue, we excised the plegic heart in 11 bovine experiments and infused an India ink solution (10 ml of India ink in 300 ml NaCl 0. 9 %) into the coronary sinus (n = 7) at a pressure of 60 cm H 2 O and into the aortic root (n = 4) at a pressure of 120 cm H 2 O. After fixation, the ventricles were cut in 11 transversal slices. The portion of coloured (= perfused) ventricular myocardium was calculated with computer-aided morphometric analysis. With antegrade infusion, 95 +/- 5 % (mean +/- standard deviation) of the left ventricular volume (left ventricular free wall plus interventricular septum) was stained, with retrograde infusion 94 +/- 3 %. Perfusion of the right ventricle was significantly lower with retrograde infusion (antegrade infusion 93 +/- 8 %, retrograde 45 +/- 13 %, p < 0. 001), especially in the basal segments (basal vs. apical: 16 +/- 26 % vs. 82 +/- 5 %, p < 0. 001). The adequate delivery of retrograde infusion to the left ventricle and septum allows good left ventricular myocardial protection with retrograde cardioplegia. Because the retrograde delivery to the right ventricle is <b>markedly</b> <b>inadequate</b> and nonuniform, the quality of right ventricular protection with retrograde cardioplegia has to be questioned...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background HIV remains {{responsible}} {{for an estimated}} 40 % of mortality in South African pregnant women and their children. To address these avoidable deaths, eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women were revised in 2010 to enhance ART coverage. With greater availability of HIV services in public health settings and increasing government attention to poor maternal-child health outcomes, this study used the patient's journey through the continuum of maternal and child care as a framework to track and document women's experiences of accessing ART and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programmes in the Eastern Cape (three peri-urban facilities) and Gauteng provinces (one academic hospital). Results In-depth interviews identified considerable weaknesses within operational HIV service delivery. These manifested as missed opportunities for HIV testing in antenatal care due to shortages of test kits; insufficient staff assigned to HIV services; late payment of lay counsellors, with consequent absenteeism; and delayed transcription of CD 4 cell count results into patient files (required for ART initiation). By contrast, individual factors undermining access encompassed psychosocial concerns, such as fear of a positive test result or a partner's reaction; and stigma. Data and information systems for monitoring in the three peri-urban facilities were <b>markedly</b> <b>inadequate.</b> Conclusions A single system- or individual-level delay reduced the likelihood of women accessing ART or PMTCT interventions. These delays, when concurrent, often signalled wholesale denial of prevention and treatment. There is great scope for health systems' reforms to address constraints and weaknesses within PMTCT and ART services in South Africa. Recommendations from this study include: ensuring autonomy over resources at lower levels; linking performance management to facility-wide human resources interventions; developing accountability systems; improving HIV services in labour wards; ensuring quality HIV and infant feeding counselling; and improved monitoring for performance management using robust systems for data collection and utilisation. </p...|$|E
40|$|On 30 October 2010, the ‘Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits to the Convention on Biological Diversity’ was {{successfully}} {{adopted by the}} tenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). By examining some of the core elements of the new treaty (scope, access, benefit-sharing and compliance), this analysis aims to assess the potential for effectiveness of the international regime on Access to genetic resources and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) as complemented by the Nagoya Protocol. Foremost, this research identifies the strengths, weaknesses and issues still to be resolved of the new legal framework. At the core, the Nagoya Protocol is built {{on the assumption that}} an effective ABS regime can only be achieved if Parties encourage users willing to participate in the conservation effort by favouring access to genetic resources but also by creating incentives to enter into ABS contracts. The new treaty develops a better common understanding on the manner ABS should operate and lays down a set of basic principles and processes Parties will need to implement in their domestic legal order. More specifically, three main evolutions may be found in the new legal framework. First of all, the scope of the ABS international regime is better defined, significantly expanded and limited in several manner. ‘Utilization of genetic resource’ constitutes the major theoretical breakthrough and becomes the corner-stone of the ABS concept. Secondly, the Protocol stresses that the exercise of States sovereign rights in designing access regulation may not run against the needs for certainty of users and user countries. Thirdly, the emphasis on user side measures is another major change since it explicitly recognizes that contractual provisions and provider legislation are alone <b>markedly</b> <b>inadequate</b> for an effective ABS regime. Even if many practicalities remain to be defined, this research concludes that the new framework has potential to achieve the ABS objective of the CBD and thereby contribute to equity, sustainability and biodiversity conservation. If successfully implemented in a consistent and mutually supportive manner by its future States Parties, it is argued that ABS may grow up to a key instrument in the global governance of biodiversity conservation...|$|E
