Sheila was at the party, is still at the flat having just woken up and is feeling terrible after the high of the drugs. She {{is one of four}} daughters of a retired general and there is every sign that Sheila and her sisters are going wild, getting into a bad set where the cocaine flows freely. Stoddart lectures her about the cocaine and Poirot {{introduces}} himself. It is obvious that Sheila has heard of him and is nervous of him. Poirot compares drug-peddling to feeding on human flesh (in his <b>mind,</b> <b>like</b> the horses of Diomedes, who were fed on human flesh).|$|E

500|$|Written {{in the key}} of G major, [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] is a pop and dance-pop song which {{utilizes}} {{guitars and}} synthesizers. It has a length of three minutes and forty seconds (3:40), and runs at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The lyrics of the song address a lover of Perry whose mood swings are affecting the couple's relationship. The song opens with Perry confronting her former partner over his frequent changes of mind, singing [...] "You change your <b>mind</b> <b>like</b> a girl changes clothes / Yeah you PMS like a bitch". In the chorus, she uses antonyms to describe her partner's mood changes, with the chorus of the song including the lines [...] "You're hot then you're cold / You're yes then you're no / You're in then you're out / You're up then you're down".|$|E

The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a good movie, but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E
500|$|Zotov {{became one}} of Peter's first friends, and the two {{remained}} close throughout Zotov's life. Lindsey Hughes, a 20th-century historian, has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know. Her contemporary, Robert K. Massie, {{has argued that the}} education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, Ivan V, was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered [...] "the best education for a <b>mind</b> <b>like</b> Peter's", as it [...] "stimulated [...] curiosity" [...] and allowed him to become [...] "in large part, a self-taught man". Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom—including even the powerful Menshikov—feared his influence.|$|E

[...] According to Ellmann, Joyce stated to Edmond Jaloux that Finnegans Wake would be written [...] "to suit the esthetic of the dream, where the forms prolong and multiply themselves", and once informed a friend that [...] "he conceived of his book as the dream of old Finn, lying in death beside the river Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world – past and future – flow through his <b>mind</b> <b>like</b> flotsam on the river of life." [...] While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance. They say it's obscure. They compare it, of course, with Ulysses. But the action of Ulysses was chiefly during the daytime, and the action of my new work takes place chiefly at night.

2500|$|Event-causal {{accounts}} of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of <b>mind</b> (<b>like</b> {{those of the}} compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events {{are said to be}} caused by the agent. A number of event-causal {{accounts of}} free will have been created, referenced here as deliberative indeterminism, centred accounts, and efforts of will theory. The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the [...] "elbow room" [...] that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.|$|E

2500|$|The Indian philosopher-sage Sri Aurobindo {{attempted}} {{to unite the}} Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his integral psychology, as have many philosophers and New religious movements. Judaism teaches that [...] "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. Christianity has tended to see the mind as distinct from the soul (Greek nous) and sometimes further distinguished from the spirit. Western esoteric traditions sometimes refer to a mental body that exists on a plane other than the physical. Hinduism's various philosophical schools have debated whether the human soul (Sanskrit atman) is distinct from, or identical to, Brahman, the divine reality. Taoism sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the body. Confucianism sees the <b>mind,</b> <b>like</b> the body, as inherently perfectible.|$|E
2500|$|Charles, {{motivated}} not {{by small}} but great ambitions, implanted in his <b>mind</b> <b>like</b> a seed {{the resolution of}} taking Constantinople. He dreamed {{that if he could}} become the master of it, he would restore the entire monarchy, so to speak, of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He was very able not only in planning what he wished to do but in easily translating his thoughts into action. Clearly he surpassed all his predecessors in the strength of his nature and intelligence.... Nevertheless, neither his actions against the Greeks nor those of Michael Palaeologus against the Latins could be brought to a successful conclusion. For the strength of both was for a long time so evenly matched that it was well said (this was the opinion of discerning people) that if at that time such an Emperor had not been directing Greek affairs, the Empire would easily have succumbed to Charles, the King of Italy and, conversely, if such a King had not then been at the helm of Italian affairs, the hegemony of Italy would with little difficulty have passed to Michael Palaeologus.|$|E
2500|$|In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} whilst the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had {{the sense of a}} suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's <b>mind,</b> <b>like</b> a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|But he {{was also}} sure that Oldbuck's {{greatest}} resemblance was to his own author, and this view has been widely accepted by modern critics. [...] Scott's pursuit of antiquities {{was every bit as}} enthusiastic as Oldbuck's, and he could easily have said with the laird of Monkbarns “My great-great-great-grandfather – it's a shame to the English language that we have not a less clumsy way of expressing a relationship of which we have occasion to think and speak so frequently.” [...] A particular obsession of Scott's was the tracking down of Border ballads, which he edited in The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and likewise Oldbuck was “a diligent collector of these scraps of ancient poetry”. [...] In later years Scott repeatedly compared himself to Oldbuck when discussing his antiquarian pursuits in his letters. [...] The two men were equally capable of being taken in by fraudulent impositions on their credulity, as when Scott accepted the fake ballad “Barthram’s Dirge” and a manufactured Latin legend about a spectre knight from his friend Robert Surtees. [...] They were also equally prone to buying land purely for its historical associations, Scott being in the process of completing his acquisition of the entire wide-ranging site of the battle of Melrose while he was writing The Antiquary. [...] Oldbuck’s preference for publishing his scholarly papers and the proposed notes for Lovel's Caledoniad anonymously or pseudonymously recall the fact that The Antiquary, like all the earlier Waverley novels, first appeared without Scott's name. [...] Both men were careful in their daily expenditure, yet generous to others. [...] Scott gave to his creation many of his own family circumstances, legal training, and experiences in love, with the young Oldbuck's rejection by Eveline Neville echoing quite closely Scott’s own by Williamina Belsches, even to the retreat into antiquarianism as a distraction from his sorrows. [...] John Sutherland has suggested that the name of Oldbuck's house, Monkbarns, is analogous to that of Scott’s new home Abbotsford. [...] Scott and his brainchild took opposite sides in politics – [...] Oldbuck being a Whig, Scott a Tory – and many critics have been surprised at the defence of the French Revolution Scott allows Oldbuck to voice, but it has been claimed that Oldbuck's views on this question are identical with those expressed by Scott in his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Revolution being for both of them a historical necessity. [...] A. N. Wilson believed that if Scott had continued to quietly cultivate his friendships and the life of the <b>mind</b> <b>like</b> Oldbuck, rather than indulging a folie de grandeur like Wardour's, he would have died a happier man.|$|E
