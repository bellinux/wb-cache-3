2500|$|Despite {{the many}} accolades he had received, Winters {{remained}} humble about his service. During the interview {{segment of the}} miniseries Band of Brothers, Winters quoted a passage from a letter he received from Sergeant Mike Ranney, [...] "I cherish the memories of a question <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> asked {{me the other day}} when he said, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?' Grandpa said 'No...but I served in a company of heroes'." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of his arrest and the ensuing trial, Barry decided in June 1990 not to seek {{re-election}} as mayor. After his arrest and through his trial, Barry continued as mayor. He even ran as an independent for an at-large seat on the council against 74-year-old incumbent Hilda Mason. Mason, a former ally who had helped Barry recuperate after the 1977 shooting, took the challenge personally, saying, [...] "I do feel very disappointed in <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> Marion Barry." [...] Mason was endorsed by a majority of the council members and by Jesse Jackson, who was running for shadow senator.|$|E

For these reasons, I appoint <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> Karim, the son of my own son, Aly Salomone Khan to succeed to the title of Aga Khan and to the Imam and Pir of all Shia Ismailian followers” ...|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{compiled a}} mixed {{record on the}} subjects of race relations and desegregation. [...] While he initially voted against civil rights legislation, in 1959 he hired one of the Capitol's first black congressional aides, and he also took steps to integrate the United States Capitol Police {{for the first time}} since Reconstruction. Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring racial segregation. Byrd said that he regretted filibustering and voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would change it if he had the opportunity. Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. [...] "The death of <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> caused me to stop and think," [...] said Byrd, adding he came to realize [...] that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his. [...] During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff [...] "I'm the only one in the Senate who must vote for this bill".|$|E

[...] "So {{you are going to}} marry, and to go into Parliament in place of that good-for-nothing Sir Francis Clavering. I wanted him to give <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> his seat--why did he not give <b>my</b> <b>grandson</b> his seat? I hope you are to {{have a great deal of}} money with Miss Amory.

[...] And Kunigunde laid an ungentle grasp upon Friedmund, who was {{clinging}} to his mother, hiding his face in her gown. He struggled against the clutch, and would not look up or be detached.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{sensible}} question, Hoo-Hoo, {{a sensible}} question. As I have told you, {{in those days}} food-getting was easy. We were very wise. A few men got the food for many men. The other men did other things. As you say, I talked. I talked all the time, and for this food was given me--much food, fine food, beautiful food, food that I have not tasted in sixty years and shall never taste again. I sometimes think the most wonderful achievement of our tremendous civilization was food--its inconceivable abundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. O <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful things to eat." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are true}} savages. Already has begun {{the custom of}} wearing human teeth. In another {{generation}} you will be perforating your noses and ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another. And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as well--as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> have already begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was at Lake Temescal, not {{far from}} the {{one-time}} city of Oakland, that I came upon the first live human beings. Oh, <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> how can I describe to you my emotion, when, astride my horse and dropping down the hillside to the lake, I saw the smoke of a campfire rising through the trees. Almost did my heart stop beating. I felt that I was going crazy. Then I heard the cry of a babe--a human babe. And dogs barked, and my dogs answered. I did not know but what I was the one human alive in the whole world. It could not be true that here were others--smoke, and the cry of a babe.|$|R

"With {{regard to}} my books, those I had in France and those I left in Philadelphia being now {{assembled}} together here, and a catalogue made of them, {{it is my}} intention {{to dispose of the}} same as follows: My 'History of the Academy of Sciences,' in sixty or seventy volumes quarto, I give to the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, of which I have the honour to be president.

6000|$|... "That {{was the way}} the Scarlet Death slew. I {{caught up}} my handbag and fled. The sights in the streets were terrible. One {{stumbled}} on bodies everywhere. Some were not yet dead. And even as you looked, you saw men sink down with the death fastened upon them. There were numerous fires burning in Berkeley, while Oakland and San Francisco were apparently being swept by vast conflagrations. The smoke of the burning filled the heavens, so that the midday was as a gloomy twilight, and, in the shifts of wind, sometimes the sun shone through dimly, a dull red orb. Truly, <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> it was like {{the last days of the}} end of the world.|$|R

6000|$|... "Our {{progress}} was painfully slow. The {{women and children}} could not walk fast. They did not dream of walking, <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> in the way all people walk to-day. In truth, none of us knew how to walk. It was not until after the plague that I learned really to walk. So {{it was that the}} pace of the slowest was the pace of all, for we dared not separate on account of the prowlers. There were not so many now of these human beasts of prey. The plague had already well diminished their numbers, but enough still lived to be a constant menace to us. Many of the beautiful residences were untouched by fire, yet smoking ruins were everywhere. The prowlers, too, seemed to have got over their insensate desire to burn, and it was more rarely that we saw houses freshly on fire.|$|R

The man who had sent them, perched in his lofty building, had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great conflagrations he had described as raging around him. And what had occurred in New York had been duplicated in all the other cities. It was the same in San Francisco, and Oakland, and Berkeley. By Thursday the people were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled, and dead bodies lay everywhere. Thursday night the panic outrush for the country began. Imagine, <b>my</b> <b>grandsons,</b> people, thicker than the salmon-run you have seen on the Sacramento river, pouring out of the cities by millions, madly over the country, in vain attempt to escape the ubiquitous death.
