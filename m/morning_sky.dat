5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the <b>morning</b> <b>sky</b> and had passed extremely close to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E

500|$|Japanese astronomers using a {{coronagraph}} saw {{the comet}} break into three pieces 30 minutes before perihelion. [...] When the comet reappeared in the <b>morning</b> <b>sky</b> in early November, {{two of these}} nuclei were definitely detected with the third suspected. [...] The comet developed a very prominent tail, about 25° in length, before fading throughout November. [...] It was last detected in January 1966.|$|E
500|$|The Great Comet of 1843 {{was first}} noticed in early February of that year, just over {{three weeks before}} its {{perihelion}} passage. By February 27 it was easily visible in the daytime sky, and observers described seeing a tail 2–3° long stretching away from the Sun before being lost {{in the glare of}} the sky. After its perihelion passage, it reappeared in the <b>morning</b> <b>sky,</b> and developed an extremely long tail. [...] It extended about 45° across the sky on March 11 and was more than 2° wide; the tail was calculated to be more than 300 million kilometers (2AU) long. [...] This held the record for the longest measured cometary tail until 2000, when Comet Hyakutake's tail was found to stretch to some 550 million kilometers in length. (The Earth–Sun distance—1AU—is only 150 million kilometers.) ...|$|E
500|$|Lying {{directly}} {{south of}} Gemini's bright stars Castor and Pollux, Canis Minor {{is a small}} constellation bordered by Monoceros to the south, Gemini to the north, Cancer to the northeast, and Hydra to the east. It does not border Canis Major; Monoceros is in between the two. Covering 183 square degrees, Canis Minor ranks seventy-first of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. The constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [...] and , while the declination coordinates are between [...] and [...] Most visible in the evening sky from January to March, Canis Minor is most prominent at 10 PM during mid-February. It is then seen {{earlier in the evening}} until July, when it is only visible after sunset before setting itself, and rising in the <b>morning</b> <b>sky</b> before dawn. The constellation's three-letter abbreviation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is [...] "CMi".|$|E

50|$|The rhyme is a rule {{of thumb}} used for weather {{forecasting}} during the past two millennia. It is based on the reddish glow of the <b>morning</b> or evening <b>sky,</b> caused by haze or clouds related to storms in the region. If the <b>morning</b> <b>skies</b> are red, it is because clear skies over the horizon to the east permit the sun to light the undersides of moisture-bearing clouds. The saying assumes that more such clouds are coming in from the west. Conversely, in order to see red clouds in the evening, sunlight must have a clear path from the west, so therefore the prevailing westerly wind must be bringing clear skies.|$|R

500|$|Bright {{stars were}} {{important}} to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of Fiji at 17°S and thus passes directly over the islands each night. Sirius served as {{the body of a}} [...] "Great Bird" [...] constellation called Manu, with Canopus as the southern wingtip and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. Just as the appearance of Sirius in the <b>morning</b> <b>sky</b> marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the Māori, whose name Takurua described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the winter solstice was marked by celebration in Hawaii, where it was known as Ka'ulua, [...] "Queen of Heaven". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including Tau-ua in the Marquesas Islands, Rehua in New Zealand, and Ta'urua-fau-papa [...] "Festivity of original high chiefs" [...] and Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai [...] "Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies" [...] in Tahiti. The Hawaiian people had many names for Sirius, including Aa ("glowing"), Hoku-kauopae, Kau-ano-meha (also Kaulanomeha), [...] "Standing-alone-and-sacred", Hiki-kauelia or Hiki-kauilia (the navigational name), Hiki-kau-lono-meha ("star of solitary Lono", the astrological name), Kaulua (also Kaulua-ihai-mohai, [...] "flower of the heavens"), Hiki-kauelia, Hoku-hoo-kele-waa ("star which causes the canoe to sail", a marine navigation name), and Kaulua-lena ("yellow star"). The people of the Society Islands called Sirius variously Taurua-fau-papa, Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha, and Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai. Other names for Sirius included Palolo-mua (Futuna), Mere (Mangaia), Apura (Manihiki), Taku-ua (Marquesas Islands), and Tokiva (Pukapuka). In the cosmology of the Tuamotus, Sirius had various names, including Takurua-te-upuupu, Te Kaha ("coconut fibre"), Te Upuupu, Taranga, and Vero-ma-torutoru ("flaming and diminishing").|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "planet" [...] {{comes from}} the Greek term [...] (planētēs), meaning [...] "wanderer", as ancient astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in {{relation}} to the other stars. Five planets can be seen with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the Greek names being Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Zeus and Cronus. Sometimes the luminaries, the Sun and Moon, are added to the list of naked eye planets to make a total of seven. Since the planets disappear from time to time when they approach the Sun, careful attention is required to identify all five. Observations of Venus are not straightforward. Early Greeks thought that the evening and morning appearances of Venus represented two different objects, calling it Hesperus ("evening star") when it appeared in the western evening sky and Phosphorus ("light-bringer") when it appeared in the eastern <b>morning</b> <b>sky.</b> They eventually came to recognize that both objects were the same planet. Pythagoras is given credit for this realization.|$|E
