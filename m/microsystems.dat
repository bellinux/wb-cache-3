40|$|A small quantum {{scattering}} system (the <b>microsystem)</b> is {{studied in}} interaction {{with a large}} system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the <b>microsystem</b> in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as compared to typical energies/momenta within the <b>microsystem).</b> The analysis is carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking place within the macrosystem is assumed {{to depend on the}} stochastic variables in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the <b>microsystem</b> is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state. Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude for the <b>microsystem</b> is highly non-linear. In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the ensemble (of <b>microsystem</b> plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the <b>microsystem</b> in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an entangled state.
