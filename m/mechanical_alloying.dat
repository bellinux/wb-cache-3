50|$|An {{amorphous}} metal (also known as metallic glass or glassy metal) {{is a solid}} metallic material, usually an alloy, with a disordered atomic-scale structure.

40|$|Abstract: Boron (B) {{has great}} {{potential}} {{to be the primary}} fuel in energetic systems for its high heating values per unit volume and mass. The existence of B 2 O 3 layer on its surface holding the combustion of B back has limited its extensive utilization. Adding magnesium (Mg) into B can improve its poor combustion performance according to the previous research. A new technique, cryomilling, was employed to prepare Mg and B (Mg/B) composite powders. The powders were cryomilled with a ball-to-powder ratio (BPR) of 80 : 1 (w/w) and an impeller rotation speed of 400 rpm, 500 rpm and 600 rpm. The cryomilling time is 5 h, 6 h and 7 h. A small amount of ferrum (Fe) is introduced into the powders in spite that the main phases are Mg and B. The effects of cryomilling parameters, such as cryomilling time and rotation speed on Mg/B composite powders were investigated. The results show the amount of active Mg and B is over 80 %.
