500|$|The {{acquisition}} of Nova Publications by Maclaren in 1954 gave New Worlds the stability to establish {{itself as a}} leading magazine. [...] Ashley describes the period from 1954 to 1960 as a [...] "Golden Age" [...] for New Worlds. [...] Carnell bought J. G. Ballard's first sale, [...] "Escapement", {{which appeared in the}} December 1956 New Worlds; Ballard {{went on to become a}} significant figure in the genre in the 1960s. Ballard was grateful to Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s. [...] Much of Ballard's work appeared in New Worlds and Science Fantasy, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell [...] "recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> writing in my own way." [...] Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with [...] "Visitors' Book" [...] in the April 1955 New Worlds. [...] James White began publishing with [...] "Assisted Passage" [...] in the January 1953 New Worlds, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with [...] "Sector General" [...] in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as The Day of the Triffids, began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with [...] "For All the Night" [...] in the April 1958 issue. [...] Arthur C. Clarke, another very successful British sf writer of the period, wrote relatively few short stories for the British market, but did publish [...] "Who's There" [...] in the November 1958 New Worlds. [...] Colin Kapp began his popular [...] "Unorthodox Engineers" [...] series with [...] "The Railways up on Cannis", in October 1959. [...] Other less well-known writers who were prolific during the late 1950s included J. T. McIntosh, Kenneth Bulmer, and E. C. Tubb.|$|E

[...] He sent imperial messengers to make sacrifices to Wei and restore the stone monument, and he also summoned Wei's wife and children, greatly awarding them.|$|E
2500|$|After Carter died of {{complications}} of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for [...] "a year or so", Ralph faced a hard {{decision on whether}} to continue performing on his own. [...] "I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. [...] But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls [...] [...] [...] I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 September Mr Dinos was one {{of eight}} three-year-olds to contest the classic St Leger over {{fourteen}} and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead after a quarter mile and led the field until the final turn but faded in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Bollin Eric, Highest, Bandari and Mamool. Cole later commented that the colt [...] "went too fast" [...] in the race. On 27 October the colt returned to France for the Group One Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse {{in which he was}} ridden by the French jockey Dominique Boeuf. He was made the 3.6/1 third choice in the betting behind the Andre Fabre-trained pair Morozov (Prix Hubert de Chaudenay) and Bernimixa (Prix de Pomone) whilst the other runners included Sulk and Cut Quartz (Prix Kergorlay). As in his previous French race he took the lead from the start and soon opened up a clear lead. He kept on well in the straight and won by two lengths from Sulk with a gap of four lengths back to Morozov in third. His victory made him the first British-trained winner of the race since Moonax triumphed in 1994. After the race Boeuf commented [...] "I controlled the race from start to finish. Mr Cole told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> if no-one else did, but not to make the pace too quick... he ran on again in the final furlong".|$|E
