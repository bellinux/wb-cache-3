What makes Helnwein's art significant is its ability to make us reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Cup day is {{a public}} holiday for all working within {{metropolitan}} Melbourne and some parts of regional Victoria, but not for some country Victorian cities and towns which hold their own spring carnivals. For Federal Public Servants it is also observed as a holiday in {{the entire state of}} Victoria, and from 2007 to 2009 also in the Australian Capital Territory known as Family and Community Day replacing Picnic Day. The Melbourne cup captures the public's imagination to the extent that people whether at work, home, school, or out and about usually stop to watch or listen to the great race. Many people from outside of Melbourne take a half or full day off work to celebrate the occasion. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that the day should be a national public holiday as Sick leave is said to increase on the day and productivity wanes.|$|E
500|$|Okereke read Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre's Critique of Everyday Life, works which analyse {{how people}} {{experience}} leisure in modern societies, and {{was inspired to}} pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. [...] "The Prayer" [...] is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while [...] "On" [...] specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, [...] "In a time when so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine." [...] "Sunday" [...] details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while [...] "SRXT" [...] {{takes the form of}} a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis. The album closer is named after Seroxat, a trade name for the antidepressant paroxetine, and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke's friends after they left university in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Sinko {{admits that}} the modern {{facility}} with large vats of cheese and milk processing would seem to contradict the word [...] "Handmade" [...] in the company name. According to him, all of the cheese is monitored, processed, and prepared by hand, but simply {{on a larger scale}} than most artisanal cheesemakers. Unlike most artisan cheeses, Beecher's is made largely with pasteurized milk. Dammeier believes that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> raw milk cheeses taste better due to renowned French cheeses, which were historically made of raw milk because the farms were unable to afford pasteurization. [...] "I've probably tasted 150 different cheeses this year, and I'm convinced that raw milk doesn't create more flavor," [...] he said, adding that his cheeses have a more consistent taste from not using raw milk. Nevertheless, Beecher's offers a raw milk version of their Flagship cheese. The cheeses they produce use no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Beecher's typically manufactures up to nine different varieties of cheeses each year, including a combination of their staple brands and various seasonal varieties.|$|E

2500|$|Berlin's chronic {{financial}} problems make any expansion not {{mandated by the}} Hauptstadtvertrag—the document that regulates the necessary changes to the city as the capital of Germany—unlikely. Furthermore, there is still great rivalry for construction money between the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. [...] After the construction boom that followed the reunification of the city, enthusiasm for further growth has cooled off; <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that Berlin's needs are adequately met by the present U- and S-Bahn. [...] As of 2007, the only proposals receiving serious consideration aim to facilitate travel around the existing system, such as moving Warschauer Straße's U-Bahn station closer to its S-Bahn station.|$|E
2500|$|H. axyridis, {{like other}} ladybeetles or ladybirds, uses {{isopropyl}} methoxy pyrazine {{as a defensive}} chemical to deter predation, but also contains this chemical in its hemolymph at much higher concentrations than many other such species, along with species/genus-specific defensive compounds such as harmonine. These insects will [...] "reflex bleed" [...] when agitated, releasing hemolymph from their legs. The liquid has a foul odour (similar to that of dead leaves) and can cause stains. Some people have allergic reactions, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis when exposed to these beetles. Sometimes, the beetles will bite humans, presumably {{in an attempt to}} acquire salt, although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> a pricking sensation as a ladybeetle walks across the skin, which is just the pressure from the ladybird's feet. Bites normally do no more harm than cause irritation, although a small number of people are allergic to bites.|$|E
60|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> {{the need}} of prayer to resist the evil in {{themselves}} and {{to keep them in}} mind of divine emotion. And many want not merely prayer but formal prayer and the support of others, praying in unison. The writer does not understand this desire or need for collective prayer very well, but there are people who appear to do so {{and there is no reason}} why they should not assemble for that purpose. And there is no doubt that divine poetry, divine maxims, religious thought finely expressed, may be heard, rehearsed, collected, published, and distributed by associations. The desire for expression implies a sort of assembly, a hearer at least as well as a speaker. And expression has many forms. People with a strong artistic impulse will necessarily want to express themselves by art when religion touches them, and many arts, architecture and the drama for example, are collective undertakings. I do not see why there should not be, under God, associations for building cathedrals and suchlike great still places urgent with beauty, into which men and women may go to rest from the clamour of the day's confusions; I do not see why men should not make great shrines and pictures expressing their sense of divine things, and why they should not combine in such enterprises rather than work to fill heterogeneous and chaotic art galleries. A wave of religious revival and religious clarification, such as I foresee, will most certainly bring with it a great revival of art, religious art, music, songs, and writings of all sorts, drama, the making of shrines, praying places, temples and retreats, the creation of pictures and sculptures. It is not necessary to have priestcraft and an organised church for such ends. Such enrichments of feeling and thought are part of the service of God.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, indeed, {{what would}} heaven be worth without God? But how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that {{the curse of}} this day is, that most people have {{forgotten}} THAT? They are selfishly anxious enough about their own souls, but they have forgotten God. They are religious, for fear of hell; {{but they are not}} godly, for they do not love God, or see God's hand in every thing. They forget that they have a Father in heaven; that He sends rain, and sunshine, and fruitful seasons; that He gives them all things richly to enjoy in spite of all their sins. His mercies are far above, out of their sight, and therefore His judgments are far away out of their sight too; and so they talk of the [...] "Visitation of God," [...] as if it was something that was very extraordinary, and happened very seldom; and when it came, only brought evil, harm, and sorrow. If a man lives on in health, they say he lives by the strength of his own constitution; if he drops down dead, they say he died by [...] "the visitation of God." [...] If the corn-crops go on all right and safe, they think THAT quite natural-- the effect of the soil, and the weather, and their own skill in farming and gardening. But if there comes a hailstorm or a blight, and spoils it all, and brings on a famine, they call it at once [...] "a visitation of God." [...] My friends! do you think God [...] "visits" [...] the earth or you only to harm you? I tell you that every blade of grass grows by [...] "the visitation of God." [...] I tell you that every healthy breath you ever drew, every cheerful hour you ever spent, every good crop you ever housed safely, came to you by [...] "the visitation of God." [...] I tell you that every sensible thought or plan that ever came into your heads,--every loving, honest, manly, womanly feeling that ever rose in your hearts, God [...] "visited" [...] you to put it there. If God's Spirit had not given it you, you would never have got it of yourselves.|$|E
