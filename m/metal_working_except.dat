40|$|The {{nomination}} of <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids {{as a candidate}} for chronic inhalation studies is based upon their high production volume, the large number of occupationally-exposed workers, and the lack of carcinogenicity and chronic toxicology data for this class of mixtures. Millions of gallons of <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids are used each day in industry for cutting, milling, drilling, stamping, and grinding. NIOSH and OSHA have estimated that over a million workers are engaged in these activities and are potentially exposed dermally and via inhalation {{to a wide variety of}} formulations that have been referred to among other things as cutting oils, machining fluids, metal removal fluids, <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids, etc. Past exposures to <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids have been associated with a variety of cancers in workers. Past and present exposures are associated with adverse respiratory effects in workers and experimental animals. The distinction between past and present exposures is important because <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluid formulations continue to change. Modifications are made to improve performance, reduce cost, meet the need of new applications, and abate health concerns of workers. Despite changing formulations and reduced occupational exposure levels, adverse respiratory effects in workers continue to be a persistent problem. While known or highl...|$|R

A technique for assessing the concentration of surface—active components of both synthetic and oil emulsion <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids is described. Results obtained using this technique provided evidence of surfactant depletion in oil emulsion fluids as a result of growth of a mixed fungal inoculum, but this effect was not recorded when these isolates were grown in synthetic fluids. Synthetic <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluds of known composition were formulated and the ability of selected fungal isolates to utilise both these fluids and the individual components thereof as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen was assessed. The <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluid components triethanolamine and diethanolamine borate were found to be readily available nutrient sources for growth of the isolates, the extent of growth being limited by the availability of carbon rather than nitrogen. Varying the initial pH of the medium was found to have no significant effect upon the extent of growth recorded at initial pH values of 7. 0, 8. 0 and 9. 0. The use of respirometric techniques provided evidence to suggest that some of the enzymes involved in the fungal degradation of synthetic <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluid components might be inducible. The effect of fungal growth upon the composition of the complete synthetic <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids was determined using the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas—liquid chromatography linked mass spectrometry.

40|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> {{industry}} {{needs to}} reduce the waste associated with scrap, worn tools, degradation of <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids, and etc. One task in this project concerned <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids (MWF), which typically consists of surfactants, anti-microbial agents, lubricating agents, complexing agents, {{and a number of}} other components. The waste stream volume from the MWF can be reduced by judiciously (1) recycling, (2) selective replacement of expended components, and (3) protecting against microbial contamination. This activity consists of developing an analytical method, amenable to automation, which addresses all three of the methods of extending the MWF lifetime, thereby reducing the waste stream. The technology for determining key components in MWF on-line (at the machine tool) did not exist. The Y- 12 Plant`s collaboration was selected for this particular endeavor because of its ongoing machining operations and expertise in automation. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding chronic exposure of machine shop personnel to <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluid mists generated during routine machining operations. The chemical composition of <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> fluids is fairly well known, however, the chemical and physical characteristics of the resulting aerosols (mists) are not as well known.

The data collect 1 on for this research was done through a quest 1 onna 1 re. The questionnaire was developed to cover seen COI' 1 ponents of operations management, i. e. operations strategy, product design, process selection and capacity planning, facility lay out, 1 ob design, inventory management, and other management techniques. The expectation of the questionnaire was to have qualitative data of the sample companies. Data from thirty-mo <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> companies were taken for this study. The results were analyzed in two ways First the results were analyzed under individual components of operations management in order to explore the level of operations management practices implementation under each component. In addition, the results were analyzed as a hole, to analyze the overall level of operations management practices implementation in Sri Lankan <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> industries. According to the results the level of operations management implementation in SriLankan <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> lndust 1 y is relatively low. Compared to each component, facility lay out is the lowest component in implementation It was revealed that there is a relationship between operations management implementation and duration in the business.
