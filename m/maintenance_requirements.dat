40|$|Amino acid {{requirement}} {{data can}} be determined in multiple fashions. One method for determining amino acid requirement is through modeling. A portion of the data required for a comprehensive model is the <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement.</b> Two studies were conducted to determine the <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> for the sulfur amino acids during the starter period for turkeys. A low protein diet was formulated so that different levels of total sulfur amino acids could be fed to young turkeys. A <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> of approximately 26 mg/bird/day was found in both experiments. This information, coupled with the amino acid requirements for growth, will allow {{for the construction of}} an effective model to predict amino acid requirements over a wide range of environment and physiological conditions...|$|R

5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirements</b> are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E

50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement.</b> The <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the <b>maintenance</b> margin <b>requirement,</b> the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|R
40|$|Methods to genetically improve gross food {{efficiency}} (GFE) in cattle usually {{rely on a}} high {{genetic correlation}} between GFE and growth rate. Estimating this genetic correlation for cattle grazing tropical pastures is extremely difficult, so a model of individual variation in growth has been developed based on component traits which are known to affect growth rate. The model assumes that there is individual variation in mature size, <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement,</b> intake to <b>maintenance</b> ratio, and susceptibility to heat stress and to tick and worm infestation. Nutritional level is assumed to interact with <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement,</b> so that under good nutrition {{a high level of}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> maximises growth rate, whereas under a low level of nutrition a low <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> leads to maximum growth rate. The model predicts that in the presence of environmental stress the correlation between growth rate and mature size is only about 0. 5, and there is no correlation between mature size and GFE. Growth rate and GFE are correlated with resistance to parasite and heat stress and to intake:maintenance ratio. Consequently growth rate and GFE are highly correlated, especially under stressful environmental conditions. The model predicts that growth rate in one environment will be highly genetically correlated with growth rate in other similar environments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} effect of food type (formulated diet vs. natural food) and fish size on protein and energy {{utilization}} efficiencies for growth in common sole, Solea solea (L.). Replicate groups of common sole (mean initial body weight ± SD was 45. 7 g ± 2. 1 and 111. 2 g ± 4. 2) received the diets at five (natural feed) or four (formulated diet) feeding levels. The protein utilization efficiency for growth (kgCP) was higher (P > 0. 001) in common sole fed ragworms than in common sole fed the formulated diet (respectively, 0. 40 and 0. 31). Likewise, the energy utilization efficiency for growth (kgGE) was higher (P = 0. 001) in common sole fed ragworms than in common sole fed the formulated diet (respectively, 0. 57 and 0. 33). The protein <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> was not different between food types (P = 0. 64) or fish size (P = 0. 41) being on average 0. 82 g kg− 0. 8 day− 1. The energy <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> was not different between food type (P = 0. 390) but differed between fish size (P = 0. 036). The gross energy <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> of small common sole was 35 kJ g− 0. 8 day− 1.

25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal {{forces on the}} moving parts, especially for sliding seals.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} to determine the <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> of adult dogs. Suitable publications were first identified, and then used to generate relationships amongst energy requirements, husbandry, activity level, methodology, sex, neuter status, dog size, and age in healthy adult dogs. Allometric equations for <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> were determined using log-log linear regression. So that the resulting equations could readily be compared with equations reported by the National Research Council, <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> {{in the current study}} were determined in kcal/kg 0. 75 body weight (BW). Ultimately, the data of 70 treatment groups from 29 publications were used, and mean (6 standard deviation) <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> were 142. 8655. 3 kcal. kgBW 20. 75. day 21. The corresponding allometric equation was 81. 5 kcal. kgBW 20. 93. day 21 (adjusted R 2 = 0. 64; 70 treatment groups). Type of husbandry had a significant effect on <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> (P, 0. 001) : requirements were greatest in racing dogs, followed by working dogs and hunting dogs, whilst the energy requirements of pet dogs and kennel dogs were least. <b>Maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> were less in neutered compared with sexually intact dogs (P, 0. 001), but there was no effect of sex. Further, reported activity level tended to effect the <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirement</b> of the dog (P = 0. 09). This review suggests that estimating <b>maintenance</b> energy <b>requirements</b> based on BW alone may not be accurate, but that predictions that factor in husbandry, neuter status and, possibly, activity level might be superior.

40|$|One of the {{prevailing}} theories of aging, the disposable soma theory, views aging {{as the result of}} the accumulation of damage through imperfect maintenance. Aging, then, is explained from an evolutionary perspective by asserting that this lack of maintenance exists because the required resources are better invested in reproduction. However, the amount of maintenance necessary to prevent aging, ‘maintenance requirement’ has so far been largely neglected and has certainly not been considered from an evolutionary perspective. To our knowledge we are the first to do so, and arrive at the conclusion that all <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> needs an evolutionary explanation. Increases in <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> can only be selected for if these are linked with either higher fecundity or better capabilities to cope with environmental challenges to the integrity of the organism. Several observations are suggestive of the latter kind of trade-off, the existence of which leads to the inevitable conclusion that the level of <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> is in principle unbound. Even the allocation of all available resources to maintenance could be unable to stop aging in some organisms. This has major implications for our understanding of the aging process on both the evolutionary and the mechanistic level. It means that the expected effect of measures to reallocate resources to maintenance from reproduction may be small in some species. We need to have an idea of how much maintenance is necessary in the first place. Our explorations of how natural selection is expected to act on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>requirement</b> provides the first step in understanding this...|$|R
