40|$|Nuclear fuel cycles {{safeguards}} {{should be}} considered in the dynamic context of a world deployment of various reactor types and varying availability of fuel-cycle services. There will be a close interaction between thermal-reactor cycles and the future deployment of fast breeders. The quantities of plutonium and the reprocessing, conversion, fabrication, and storage methods of the fuel for the fast breeders will {{have a significant impact on}} safeguards techniques. The approach to the fast breeder fuel cycle safeguards follows the general safeguards system approach proposed by the IAEA. Objective of IAEA safeguards is the detection of diversion of nuclear material and deterrence of such diversion. To achieve independent verification of <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>accountancy</b> requires the capability to monitor inventory status and verify material flows and quantities of all nuclear materials subject to safeguards. Containment and surveillance measures are applied to monitor key measurement points, maintain integrity of material balance, and complement material accountancy. The safeguards study attempts to develop a generic reference IAEA Safeguards System and explores various system options using containment/surveillance and material accountancy instrumentation and integrated systems designs...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of process samples for radionuclide content {{is an important}} part of current procedures for <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> and <b>accountancy</b> in the different process streams of a recycling plant. The destructive sample analysis techniques currently available necessitate a significant amount of time. It is therefore desirable to develop new sample analysis procedures that allow for a quick turnaround time and increased sample throughput with a minimum of deviation between samples. In particular new capabilities for rapid sample dissolution and radiochemical separation are required. Most of the radioanalytical techniques currently employed for sample analysis are based on manual laboratory procedures. Such procedures are time and labor intensive and not well suited for situations in which a rapid sample analysis is requires and/or large number of samples needed to be analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{comparing}} gas reservoir performance using two different methods, namely numerical simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> was conducted. The Songo Songo dry gas field in Tanzania {{was used for}} this study. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare results from the two methods with actual data obtained from the field and determine which one best fits the performance of dry gas reservoir. To accomplish the objective of this study, geology of the Songo Songo field was studied and physics and principles underlying gas reservoir simulation and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> were reviewed. These guided to set-up simulation procedures, designing flowchart for <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analysis and gathering relevant data. The geological formations and stratigraphy gave guidelines to reveal factors affecting the performance of the Songo Songo reservoir. From this study, it was determined that, reservoir simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gave similar trends of the performance curves in the pR/Z plot. The analysis of variance at 95 % confidence level indicated that the probability of no significant difference between the results of the two methods was equal to 0. 927. It is early to specify that reservoir simulation or general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gives better performance of the Songo Songo dry gas reservoir because the history of the field is short and the pressure support in reservoir simulation model and in general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> model is different. Both reservoir simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> models are advised for modelling the performance of Songo Songo dry gas reservoir.

40|$|Estimating {{original}} hydrocarbons {{in place}} (OHIP) in a reservoir is fundamentally important to estimating reserves and potential profitability. Quantifying the uncertainties in OHIP estimates can improve reservoir development and investment decision-making for individual reservoirs {{and can lead}} to improved portfolio performance. Two traditional methods for estimating OHIP are volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> methods. Probabilistic estimates of OHIP are commonly generated prior to significant production from a reservoir by combining volumetric analysis with Monte Carlo methods. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> is routinely used to analyze reservoir performance and estimate OHIP. Although <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> has uncertainties due to errors in pressure and other parameters, probabilistic estimates are seldom done. In this thesis I use a Bayesian formulation to integrate volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses and to quantify uncertainty in the combined OHIP estimates. Specifically, I apply Bayes?? rule to the Havlena and Odeh <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> equation to estimate original oil in place, N, and relative gas-cap size, m, for a gas-cap drive oil reservoir. The paper considers uncertainty and correlation in the volumetric estimates of N and m (reflected in the prior probability distribution), as well as uncertainty in the pressure data (reflected in the likelihood distribution). Approximation of the covariance of the posterior distribution allows quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of N and m resulting from the combined volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses. Several example applications to illustrate the value of this integrated approach are presented. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> data reduce the uncertainty in the volumetric estimate, and the volumetric data reduce the considerable non-uniqueness of the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> solution, resulting in more accurate OHIP estimates than from the separate analyses. One of the advantages over reservoir simulation is that, with the smaller number of parameters in this approach, we can easily sample the entire posterior distribution, resulting in more complete quantification of uncertainty. The approach can also detect underestimation of uncertainty in either volumetric data or <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> data, indicated by insufficient overlap of the prior and likelihood distributions. When this occurs, the volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses should be revisited and the uncertainties of each reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Accurate <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> {{serve as}} {{essential}} tools for controlling, evaluating and optimising petrochemical processes. In natural gas processing plants, {{where there are}} only phase separation processes and no chemical reactions, accurate <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> are crucial for ensuring the optimal processing of the natural gas hydrocarbons. Due to random and gross errors, caused by faulty or miscalibrated instrumentation, wrong sampling methods and erroneous laboratory analyses, measured data are unreliable and unsuitable for <b>material</b> <b>balances.</b> In order to compensate for incorrect measured variables, data reconciliation is required, to satisfy {{the constraints of the}} <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> and minimise the residual error between the measured and the adjusted variables. Although many software packages exist that do data reconciliation, this work used Microsoft Excel to perform <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> reconciliation on Sasol's natural gas processing plant at Temane, because it is the most widely used engineering tool in the petrochemical industry. A literature study was done and mathematical techniques for the reconciliation of plant data, and statistical methods to verify the results, were obtained. Spreadsheets were created in Microsoft Excel to: process raw input data: derive correction coefficients from historic data; conduct steady-state testing; eliminate gross errors; reconcile the <b>material</b> <b>balance,</b> and verify the results via a sensitivity analysis.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} {{and benefits of}} two new approaches {{to the analysis of}} safeguards data from reprocessing plants. Both approaches involve some level of plant modeling. All models involve some form of mass balance, either applied in the usual way that leads to <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> for individual process vessels at discrete times or applied by accounting for pipe flow rates that leads to <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> for individual process vessels at continuous times. In the first case, <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> are computed after each tank-to-tank transfer. In the second case, <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> can be computed at any desired time. The two approaches can be described as follows. The first approach considers the application of a new multivariate sequential test. The test statistic is a scalar, but the monitored residual is a vector. The second approach considers the application of recent nonlinear time series methods for the purpose of empirically building a model for the expected magnitude of a <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> or other scalar variable.

30|$|Standard BO PVT {{properties}} {{of a gas}} condensate reservoir have been rigorously simulated based on hypothetical reservoir fluid and prescribed reservoir and surface production conditions to {{provide insight into the}} limitations of black-oil PVT formulations. Simulation results demonstrated that species <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> conservation of surface gas and stock tank oil pseudo-components can be violated by the BO PVT model, while still honoring overall <b>material</b> <b>balance.</b> The limitation stems from assumption inherent to the pseudo-component model, which requires the composition of every pseudo-component to remain the same regardless of pressure. The violation of the species <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> principle by the BO PVT model leads to significant errors in standard BO PVT property estimations when techniques that rely on species <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> statements are used.

The approximation is formulated directly from the rigorous <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> for the case of an abnormally-pressured gas reservoir. The primary assumption in this derivation is that WGp < 1 or Ce(p) (pi-p) < 1. Further, we can proceed by assuming that W is either constant or some arbitrary function. If we assume W=constant, then the following form results: At first glance there may be concern that this approximation is not sufficiently valid for field applications ? however, we have shown this relation to be an extraordinarily accurate approximation of the rigorous <b>material</b> <b>balance.</b> This result is suited not only for use as a characteristic model, but also for use as a data analysis mechanism (i. e., this result is used to develop a suite of analysis plots, plotting functions, a type curve, etc.).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} statistical decision theory to the testing of a nuclear <b>material</b> <b>balance.</b> It is aimed at testing a balance when there is some process hold-up which remains unmeasured or where there may be uncorrected biases in the measurement system. Possible examples occur {{in the case of}} reprocessing plants and enrichment facilities. For an incomplete balance, the method requires upper and lower tolerance limits for the net effect of holdup on the <b>material</b> <b>balance.</b> For uncorrected biases the method requires a range of values that can be tolerated for the cumulative effect of bias in the balance. The tolerance limits on hold-up and the tolerated range for the effect of bias, are used to determine the composite null hypothesis for the statistical test. The test approach provides a simple and comprehensible management of false alarm risk and is numerically easy to apply. The paper describes the numerical solution for choosing an acceptance region for the balance in terms of the tolerance limits for hold-up and bias, the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> measurement error standard deviation and the risk aversion parameter.

Typically a cumulative MUF (CUMUF) statistic, which utilizes all the available flow data, is also calculated; but there is no statutory requirement that it be reported or evaluated. Previous work has shown that cumulative MUF has greater power than MUF to detect small constant losses. Techniques which emphasize the sequential nature of MUF (that is, MUF as a sequence of values related over time) are also expected to be more sensitive for detecting losses. The recursive estimation algorithm known as the Kalman filter has been proposed as a possible solution which uses the above idea.
