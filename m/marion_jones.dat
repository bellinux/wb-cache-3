5|$|A {{sample for}} an out-of-competition drugs test that Chambers had {{provided}} in Germany on 1 August 2003 was re-examined in October and subsequently {{tested positive for}} banned substances. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO); the workplace of both Chambers' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. Both men faced charges of distributing illegal drugs to athletes in the United States. The BALCO Scandal uncovered drug use {{in a wide range}} of sportsmen and women, including sprinters <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> and Tim Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Allmänna Idrottsförening (MAI), {{the largest}} {{athletics}} club in Malmö, {{have used the}} stadium for training purposes and outdoor competition since the stadium's inauguration in 1958. MAI organises its own international athletic competition, the MAI Gala, which has been held since the 1930s. It was originally hosted at Malmö IP, but moved to Malmö Stadion after its construction. Some notable athletes who have competed in the gala are <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> Maurice Greene, Sergej Bubka and Kajsa Bergqvist.|$|E
5|$|The agents authorize Jones {{to recover}} the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the {{headpiece}} is {{in the possession of}} Ravenwood's daughter <b>Marion.</b> <b>Jones</b> visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{originally}} won bronze, but on 10 April 2008, following <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{admission that}} she had used performance-enhancing drugs, the entire team was stripped of their medals. However, Jones's teammates appealed that decision by taking {{the case to the}} Court of Arbitration. On July 16, 2010, CAS ruled in the athletes favor and both American women relay squads had their medals reallocated.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the revelations}} about <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones's</b> use of steroids, Thanou, who {{finished}} 2nd behind Jones in the 100 m at Sydney 2000, was {{in line to}} be awarded the American's gold medal, but due to Thanou's own tainted record the IOC, {{after two years of}} deliberation, opted to punish Jones without rewarding Thanou. Jones' gold medal was withdrawn but was withheld by the IOC, Thanou remaining a silver medallist.|$|R
50|$|Campbell-Brown's {{personal}} best of 10.76 s in the 100 m ranks her all-time top {{ten in the}} world (9th place) and fourth among Jamaican women. Her 200 m best (21.74 s) ranks her in the all-time top ten in the world. This time is the third best among Jamaican women. It is the fourth fastest time of the 21st century, and was the fastest since <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones's</b> 21.62 s in Johannesburg 1998. She has earned a total of 46 medals in her illustrious career (27 gold, 16 silver, 3 bronze).|$|R
5|$|The {{profile of}} the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, {{with a number of}} athletes {{becoming}} household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith-Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and prominent cases, such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.|$|E
5|$|The {{winners of}} the award are {{typically}} announced in late November or early December {{after the end of}} the outdoor track and field season. A number of athletes have received the award on more than one occasion: Jackie Joyner-Kersee was the first to do so with back-to-back wins in 1986 and 1987, while Carl Lewis won his second award in 1991. Michael Johnson was the first to receive the award three times (winning consecutively from 1994–1996) and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> became the first woman to collect three awards after wins in 1997, 1998 and 2002. In 2012, Allyson Felix won the award for the fourth time, thus distinguishing herself as the athlete with the most wins. 2014 winners are Mebrahtom Keflezighi and Jennifer Simpson. Winners receive a replica of the award while the original remains on permanent display at the USATF Headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The Washington Post, citing {{unidentified}} sources {{with knowledge}} of drug results from the USA Track and Field Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana, reported that on June 23, 2006, an [...] "A" [...] sample of <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones's</b> urine tested positive for Erythropoietin (EPO), a banned performance enhancer. Jones withdrew from the Weltklasse Golden League meet in Switzerland, citing [...] "personal reasons", and once more denied using performance-enhancing drugs. She retained lawyer Howard Jacobs, who has represented many athletes in doping cases, including Tim Montgomery and cyclist Floyd Landis. On September 6, 2006, Jones's lawyers announced that her [...] "B" [...] sample had tested negative, which cleared her from the doping allegations.|$|R
50|$|The {{positive}} {{drug test}} for Nigeria's Innocent Asonze in 1999 {{marked the first}} instance where a medal-winning team was disqualified at the World Championships in Athletics. Brazil was elevated to the bronze medal as a result. Doping persisted two years later, as France's Christophe Cheval was disqualified after a positive test for nandrolone shortly before the event (the team were semi-finalists only). The greatest disqualifications yet followed after the BALCO scandal in 2005. Tim Montgomery of the 2001-winning men's team was later disqualified following his admission of doping during the period, meaning that the American gold medallists were stricken from the record (South Africa were elevated as champions). Similarly, <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones's</b> and Kelli White's admitted usage led to the disqualification of the winning American women's team (Germany were made champions as a result).|$|R
25|$|One athlete was disqualified for a doping infraction: Rickey Harris, a men's 400m hurdles finalist, {{was later}} {{shown to have}} failed a drug test a month earlier at the same venue. Sprinters <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> Chryste Gaines and Tim Montgomery both {{attended}} but withdrew from the championships, citing injury. Montgomery and Gaines were banned from the sport later that year for doping {{as part of the}} BALCO scandal, which also implicated Jones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> {{winner of}} three gold and two bronze medals for the United States, relinquished them in October 2007 after confessing {{that she had}} taken {{tetrahydrogestrinone}} (THG) from September 2000 through July 2001. The IOC formally stripped Jones and her relay teammates of their 5 medals, although her teammates were to be offered opportunity to present a case for retaining their medals. Eventually, Jones's teammates had their medals reinstated. Jones was also banned from competing for two years by the IAAF.|$|E
25|$|Burrell was runner-up to Shana Williams at the {{national}} indoor championships, but still was selected for the 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships and she finished eighth {{in the long jump}} final. She won her first and only outdoor American title with a personal record of 6.96m in Eugene, Oregon. She reached the long jump final at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics alongside fellow Americans <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> and Shana Williams. Burrell finished sixth at what would be her first and only appearance on the outdoor world stage.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the highest}} profile doping scandals have {{involved}} the Olympic 100m competition: Ben Johnson won the 1988 Olympic 100m title in a world record time of 9.79 seconds but was later stripped of the titles after failing a drug test. <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> was the 2000 women's Olympic 100m gold medallist but had her results annulled after admitting to using performance-enhancing drugs during her Olympic victory. These controversies have affected public perceptions of drug usage among sprint athletes, as well as track and field and the Olympics in general.|$|E
25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time offenders are banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
25|$|Another {{high-profile}} doping {{case involved}} the 2000 Olympic women's 100m champion <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> though no doping infractions {{occurred during the}} Olympics. Having {{been one of the}} stars of the games—she won three gold and two bronze medals in track and field events—Jones was later implicated in doping through the BALCO scandal. She lied to federal agents and a grand jury during questioning around the scandal, but later admitted in 2007 to using Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) during the period of her Olympic success. The IOC annulled all her Olympic results, including her 100m title. Given that the 2000 women's runner-up Ekaterini Thanou had herself been banned for drug usage, the IOC chose not to upgrade her to the gold medal position, but rather leave the position vacant. Working around the dilemma, the IOC decided to raise bronze medallist Tayna Lawrence to joint silver and fourth-placed Merlene Ottey to the bronze medal position.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, she was {{the runner}} up at the United States Olympic Track and Field Trials, jumping a wind-assisted 6.97m and earning {{selection}} for the upcoming Summer Olympics. In August, she set an outdoor career best mark of 6.98m to w{{in the long jump}} at the DN Galan meeting in Stockholm. Representing the United States at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, she reached the event final as the third best qualifier behind Heike Drechsler and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> having cleared 6.77m; however, Burrell could not match her earlier form and ended the competition final with a sole legal jump of 6.38m, finishing in tenth place. She closed her season with a silver medal in the long jump at the 2000 IAAF Grand Prix Final, where she had a wind-assisted jump of 6.99m behind Drechsler. She also ran in the 100m hurdles at the competition and was seventh in the final.|$|E
25|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{in the final}} are awarded a gold, silver and bronze medal, respectively. If runners cannot be separated by their time (recorded to one hundredth of a second) further analysis is used to distinguish their times to the thousandth of a second. In the 2008 Women's 100m final the minor medallists Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart could not be separated by this method and were both awarded the silver medal. Medal positions in a 100m race have only been shared on one other occasion in Olympic history: Alajos Szokolyi and Francis Lane were joint third at the 1896 men's final. If it is subsequently found that an athlete broke the competition rules then the IOC may strip athletes of their Olympic medals. This has occurred twice in the 100m: Ben Johnson was awarded gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but was soon disqualified after his post-race drug test was positive for banned substances. The 2000 women's Olympic champion <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> held her medal for a longer period, and was only disqualified seven years later after admitting to doping during that period.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins at}} 6:00 AM (previously 5:00 AM) on Holy Saturday morning, near Mile 2 on Belize's George Price Highway, a {{favorite}} road for cycling events. Recently {{there has been}} a lead-out from inside Belize City at the BTL Park with actual racing beginning on the highway. Cyclists race to the western town of San Ignacio, in the Cayo District, turn there and return to Belize City, finishing at the <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> Sports Complex (formerly the National Stadium) with two laps on the asphalt track (more recently on flat straight portions of Princess Margaret Drive and Marine Parade while the Complex is under renovation). The estimated distance of the Classic is some 142.4 miles. Participation is limited mainly to amateur cyclists of any country, and cyclists from Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and the United States have participated. In addition to prizes awarded {{at the end of the}} race, station prizes are handed out at strategic points on the road going and coming. These prizes are usually cash donations, farm produce or certificates for trophies, jewelry and other items. Belizeans normally line the roadway to cheer on Belize's representatives in the race. While the cyclists are pushed toward Cayo by southeasterly or even easterly winds, a combination of those same fierce winds and the usual muggy conditions of Belize in the dry season traditionally faces cyclists on the return journey.|$|E
500|$|The inaugural {{winner of}} the award was American athlete <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> who, {{at the time of}} the presentation, was {{considered}} to be [...] "the world's dominant sprinter".|$|E
500|$|Wheatley's {{name and}} those of several of his {{teammates}} {{were found on the}} list of clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) that had given performance-enhancing drugs to <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> and others. [...] As a result, he, and teammates Chris Hetherington, Dana Stubblefield, and Chris Cooper were called to testify before a 2003federal grand jury investigating a laboratory that produces nutritional supplements. [...] Johnnie Morton was called before the same jury. [...] Wheatley, Stubblefield, and Morton all declined to comment. [...] This court appearance in the BALCO hearings was notable for Wheatley's assault of a freelance photographer who attempted to take Wheatley's photo outside the Philip Burton Federal Building just after Wheatley had informed the KNTV cameraman that he would sue anyone who took his picture.|$|E
500|$|Following Brauman's {{release from}} prison, Gay set out {{preparing}} for the Beijing Olympics, training with both Brauman and Jon Drummond in the off-season. Returning to competition in May, he continued as he had left off in 2007: winning the 200m in Kingston, taking gold in both sprints at the Adidas Track Classic, and finishing second in the 100m at the Reebok Grand Prix with a 9.85s run. However, Gay now faced a new, emerging challenger in Usain Bolt; at the latter event Bolt had beaten Gay with a world-record-setting 9.72s. Taking this into consideration, he realized that a world record time {{would be needed to}} beat both Bolt and Powell at the Olympics; Gay aimed to run below 9.70s. With athletes running such quick times, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) sought to counter claims of performance-enhancing drugs use through [...] "Project Believe", a regular, extensive drugs testing program. The BALCO scandal and the banning of high-profile athletes, including Gatlin and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> had damaged the public's perception of sprinting and the USADA recruited Gay to prove clean athletes could be just as successful.|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, we have nothing to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

2500|$|Márquez {{attracted}} controversy {{by hiring}} {{strength and conditioning}} coach Angel [...] "Memo Heredia" [...] Hernandez, who had supplied performance-enhancing drugs to sprinters <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> and Tim Montgomery in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, a major scandal arose {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that a company called BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), owned by Victor Conte, had been producing so-called [...] "designer steroids", (specifically [...] "the clear" [...] and [...] "the cream") which are steroids that could not be detected through drug tests at that time. In addition, the company had connections to several San Francisco Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports. Among the many athletes who have been linked to BALCO are Olympic sprinters Tim Montgomery and <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones,</b> Olympic shot-putter C. J. Hunter, and Major League Baseball players Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Before his Jeopardy! appearance, Jennings was {{a member}} of BYU's Quiz Bowl Team. Jennings' run began during Jeopardy!s 20th season with the episode aired on June 2, 2004, in which he {{unseated}} 2-time returning champion Jerry Harvey, and continued into season 21. In that first episode, Jennings's entire winning streak nearly ended before it even began. The Final Jeopardy answer was, [...] "She's the first female track & field athlete to win medals in 5 different events at a single Olympics." [...] Jennings responded with [...] "Who is Jones?", referring to <b>Marion</b> <b>Jones</b> (the shows were recorded before she was stripped of her medals as a result of admitted doping). Host Alex Trebek said, [...] "We will accept that, in terms of female athletes, there aren't that many." [...] If the response had not been accepted, Jennings would have finished in 3rd place, and challenger Julia Lazarus would have won the game instead. Jennings' run was interrupted by the off-season break in July until September, 2004 Kids' Week, the Tournament of Champions (aired from September 20, 2004 through October 1, 2004), the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election (aired on Tuesday November 2, 2004, pushing his weeks of episodes to air from Wednesday to Saturday) and the College Championship (aired from November 10, 2004 through November 23, 2004). He did not participate in the Tournament of Champions, as invitations are only extended to champions who have already been defeated (with the exception of the winner(s) of the College Championship), which Jennings had not yet been.|$|E
