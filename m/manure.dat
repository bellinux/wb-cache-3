5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock <b>manure</b> production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by <b>manure</b> production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse <b>manure</b> was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. <b>Manure</b> was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E

40|$|<b>Manures</b> are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of <b>manures.</b> The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of <b>manures</b> is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of <b>manures</b> and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of <b>manures</b> and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of <b>manures</b> could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the transfer of N via biological nitrogen fixation from green <b>manures</b> to intercropped lettuce using the 15 N abundance method. The treatments consisted of lettuce with black oats, lettuce with cowpea, lettuce with white lupin and monocropped lettuce (control). Green <b>manures</b> were sown at two different times including the following: 60 days before transplanting of lettuce seedlings and simultaneous to transplanting of lettuce seedlings. N transfer was estimated using the natural 15 N abundance method. It was observed that lettuce intercropped with green <b>manures</b> reached the same fresh mass of monocropped lettuce when the green <b>manures</b> were sown {{at the same time}} as the vegetables were planted. However, when the green <b>manures</b> were sown previously, the fresh mass of the monocropped lettuce was higher, and independent of the sowing time of green <b>manures,</b> the monocropped lettuce reached a higher dry mass. White lupin and cowpea transferred higher amounts of N regardless of sowing time, and the C:N ratio of white lupin to cowpea was lower compared to black oats.
