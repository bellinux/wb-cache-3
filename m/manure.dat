5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock <b>manure</b> production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by <b>manure</b> production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Å abac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse <b>manure</b> was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. <b>Manure</b> was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E

40|$|<b>Manures</b> are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of <b>manures.</b> The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of <b>manures</b> is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of <b>manures</b> and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of <b>manures</b> and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of <b>manures</b> could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the transfer of N via biological nitrogen fixation from green <b>manures</b> to intercropped lettuce using the 15 N abundance method. The treatments consisted of lettuce with black oats, lettuce with cowpea, lettuce with white lupin and monocropped lettuce (control). Green <b>manures</b> were sown at two different times including the following: 60 days before transplanting of lettuce seedlings and simultaneous to transplanting of lettuce seedlings. N transfer was estimated using the natural 15 N abundance method. It was observed that lettuce intercropped with green <b>manures</b> reached the same fresh mass of monocropped lettuce when the green <b>manures</b> were sown {{at the same time}} as the vegetables were planted. However, when the green <b>manures</b> were sown previously, the fresh mass of the monocropped lettuce was higher, and independent of the sowing time of green <b>manures,</b> the monocropped lettuce reached a higher dry mass. White lupin and cowpea transferred higher amounts of N regardless of sowing time, and the C:N ratio of white lupin to cowpea was lower compared to black oats.
