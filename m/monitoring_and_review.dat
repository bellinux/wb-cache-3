Noted psychologists Dr Don Bannister and Dr James Hemming were CW members, and via Hemming and Wintringham so did their friend Ernst Schumacher make contributions to party thought.

Under this model, the Executive Committee, responsible for current decision-making, is shadowed by a scrutiny panel, known in CW as the Sensory Committee, whose role is <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>review,</b> research and longer-term development. CW's interest in optimising social organisation consistent with its principles also led it to develop close {{links with the}} School of Integrative Social Research at Braziers Park, Oxfordshire.|$|E

50|$|Polypharmacy {{is the use}} of four or more {{medications}} by a patient, generally adults aged over 65 years.

Polypharmacy is not always bad, but it is bad in many instances, often being more harmful than helpful or presenting too much risk for too little benefit. Therefore, health professionals consider it a situation that requires <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> to validate whether all of the medications are still necessary. Concerns about polypharmacy include increased adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, prescribing cascade, and higher costs. Polypharmacy is often associated with a decreased quality of life, including decreased mobility and cognition.|$|E
