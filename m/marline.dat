25|$|There {{are three}} Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the borough; <b>Marline</b> Valley Woods, Combe Haven and Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach. <b>Marline</b> Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It {{is an ancient}} {{woodland}} of Pedunculate oak—hornbeam which is uncommon nationally. Sussex Wildlife Trust own part of the site. Combe Haven is another site of biological interest, with alluvial meadows, and the largest reed bed in the county, providing habitat for breeding birds. It is in the West St Leonards ward, stretching into the parish of Crowhurst. The final SSSI, Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach, is within the Ore ward of Hastings, extending into the neighbouring Fairlight and Pett parishes. The site runs along the coast and is of both biological and geological interest. The cliffs hold many fossils and the site has many habitats, including ancient woodland and shingle beaches.|$|E

The couple had three more children: William Robert Knorr (born September 15, 1967), Robert Wallace Knorr, Jr. (born December 31, 1968) and Theresa Marie [...] "Terry" [...] Knorr (born August 5, 1970, died December 8, 2011), whom Theresa named after herself. Theresa and Robert Knorr's {{marriage}} began to deteriorate after Theresa began accusing her husband of having affairs. Fed up with Theresa's constant accusations, Knorr left her in June 1969 and was granted a divorce in 1970. After the divorce, Robert Knorr attempted to see his children but Theresa prevented him from doing so.|$|E

She was {{overhauled}} and then on 3 November 1986 the platform supply vessel Vigen Supplier towed her out of Falmouth. Searoyal renamed her Queen M and registered her in Limassol under the Cypriot flag of convenience. She was operated by a Searoyal subsidiary, <b>Marlines</b> Ferries.

[...] The crew call him the [...] "sailor's waiter," [...] as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, <b>marline,</b> and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which {{includes}} serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. [...] He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged {{to work with the}} crew. [...] He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. [...] His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.|$|E

50|$|This hull armor {{had been}} {{installed}} {{in just three}} days, {{more than a year}} before, while Kearsarge was in port at the Azores. It was made using 720 ft of 1.7 in single-link iron chain and covered hull spaces 49 ft long by 6 ft deep. It was stopped up and down in three layers to eye-bolts with <b>marlines</b> and secured by iron dogs. This was then concealed behind 1 in deal-boards painted black to match the upper hulls color. This chain cladding was placed along Kearsarges port and starboard midsection down to her waterline, for the purpose of protecting her engines and boilers when the upper portion of the cruiser's coal bunkers were empty. This armor belt was hit twice during the fight: First in the starboard gangway by one of Alabamas 32-pounder shells which cut the chain armor, denting the hull planking underneath, then again by a second 32-pounder shell that exploded and broke a link of the chain, tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. Even if the shells had been delivered by Alabamas more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, the impacts were more than 5 ft above the waterline and would therefore have missed her vital machinery.|$|R
5000|$|Kearsarge's hull armor {{had been}} {{installed}} {{in just three}} days, {{more than a year}} before, while she was in port at the Azores. It was made using [...] of 1.7 in single link iron chain and covered hull spaces 49 ft long by 6 ft deep. It was stopped up and down to eye-bolts with <b>marlines</b> and secured by iron dogs. Her chain armor was concealed behind 1-inch deal-boards painted black to match the upper hull's color. This [...] "chaincladding" [...] was placed along Kearsarges port and starboard midsection down to the waterline, for additional protection of her engine and boilers when the upper portion of her coal bunkers were empty (coal bunkers played an important part in the protection of early steam vessels, such as protected cruisers). A hit to her engine or boilers could easily leave Kearsarge dead in the water and vulnerable, or even cause a boiler explosion or fire that could destroy the cruiser. Her armor belt was hit twice during the fight: First in the starboard gangway by one of Alabamas 32-pounder shells that cut the chain armor, denting the hull planking underneath, then again by a second 32-pounder shell that exploded and broke a link of the chain armor, tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. If those rounds had come from Alabamas more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, they would have easily penetrated, but the likely result would not have been very serious, as both shots struck the hull a little more than five feet above the waterline. Even if both shots had penetrated Kearsarges side, they would have completely missed her vital machinery. However, a 100-pound shell could have done a great deal of damage to her interior and nearby crewmen; hot fragments could have easily set fire to the cruiser, one of the greatest risks aboard a wooden vessel. A little more than an hour after the first shot was fired, Alabama was reduced to a sinking wreck by Kearsarges powerful 11 in Dahlgrens, forcing Captain Semmes to strike his colors and to send one of his two surviving boats to Kearsarge to ask for assistance.|$|R

If you take {{a hundred and fifty}} people off a steamer that has sunk, and if you get a man as shrewd as Mr. Smith to plug the timber seams with mallet and <b>marline,</b> and if you turn ten bandsmen of the Mariposa band on to your hand pump on the bow of the lower decks--float? why, what else can she do? ...|$|E
60|$|On the fore-yard, Mr. Leach {{passed out}} on one yard-arm, and his co-adventurer, a common seaman, on the other. Each left a hook in the knot of the inner buntline, as he went out, and dropped the ball of <b>marline</b> on deck. The same was done at the outer buntlines, and at the leachlines. Here the mate returned, {{according}} to his orders, leaped upon the rigging, and thence upon a backstay, when he slid on deck with a velocity that set aim at defiance. Notwithstanding the quickness of his motions, Mr. Leach received a trifling hit on the shoulder, and several bullets whizzed near him.|$|E
60|$|Two {{men were}} {{prepared}} to run up on the fore-yard at the word. Both of these, {{one of whom was}} Mr. Leach, carried three small balls of <b>marline,</b> to the end of each of which was attached a cod-hook, the barb being filed off in order to prevent its being caught. By means of these hooks the balls were fastened to the jackets of the adventurers. Two others stood ready {{at the foot of the}} main and mizzen riggings. By the gun lay Paul and three men; while several of the passengers, and a few of the best shots among the crew, were stationed on the forecastle, armed with muskets and fowling-pieces.|$|E
60|$|The cockswain {{seized the}} harpoon which {{leaned against the}} wall, and dropped its barbed {{extremity}} within a foot of the breast of his assailant, {{with an expression of}} the eye that denoted the danger of a nearer approach. The captain, however, wanted not for courage, and stung to the quick by the insult he had received, he made a desperate parry, and attempted to pass within the point of the novel weapon of his adversary. The slight shock was followed by a sweeping whirl of the harpoon, and Borroughchffe found himself without arms, completely at the mercy of his foe. The bloody intentions of Tom vanished with his success; for, laying aside his weapon, he advanced upon his antagonist, and seized him with an open palm. One more struggle, in which the captain discovered his incompetency to make any defence against the strength of a man who managed him {{as if he had been}} a child, decided the matter. When the captain was passive in the hands of his foe, the cockswain produced sundry pieces of sennit, <b>marline,</b> and ratlin-stuff, from his pockets, which appeared to contain as great a variety of small cordage as a boatswain's storeroom, and proceeded to lash the arms of the conquered soldier to the posts of his bed, with a coolness that had not been disturbed since the commencement of hostilities, a silence that seemed inflexible, and a dexterity that none but a seaman could equal. When this part of his plan was executed, Tom paused a moment, and gazed around him as if in quest of something. The naked sword caught his eye, and, with this weapon in his hand, he deliberately approached his captive, whose alarm prevented his observing that the cockswain had snapped the blade asunder from the handle, and that he had already encircled the latter with <b>marline.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} passed: the {{brigantine}} drifting hither and thither, and nothing in sight but the sea, when forth again on its stillness rung Annatoo's domestic alarum. The truce was up. Most egregiously had the lady infringed it; appropriating to herself various objects previously disclaimed {{in favor of}} Samoa. Besides, forever on the prowl, she was perpetually going up and down; with untiring energy, exploring every nook and cranny; carrying off her spoils and diligently secreting them. Having little idea of feminine adaptations, she pilfered whatever came handy:--iron hooks, dollars, bolts, hatchets, and stopping not at balls of <b>marline</b> and sheets of copper. All this, poor Samoa would have borne with what patience he might, rather than again renew the war, were it not, that the audacious dame charged him with peculations upon her own private stores; though of any such thing he was innocent as the bowsprit.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} one very {{extensive}} warehouse among the rest that needs special mention--the ship's Yeoman's storeroom. In the Neversink it was down in the ship's basement, beneath the berth-deck, and you went to it {{by way of the}} Fore-passage, a very dim, devious corridor, indeed. Entering--say at noonday--you find yourself in a gloomy apartment, lit by a solitary lamp. On one side are shelves, filled with balls of <b>marline,</b> ratlin-stuf, seizing-stuff, spun-yarn, and numerous twines of assorted sizes. In another direction you see large cases containing heaps of articles, reminding one of a shoemaker's furnishing-store--wooden serving-mallets, fids, toggles, and heavers: iron prickers and marling-spikes; in a third quarter you see a sort of hardware shop--shelves piled with all manner of hooks, bolts, nails, screws, and thimbles; and, in still another direction, you see a block-maker's store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and wheels.|$|E
60|$|A {{thorough}} sailor {{must understand}} much of other avocations. He {{must be a}} bit of an embroiderer, to work fanciful collars of hempen lace about the shrouds; he must be something of a weaver, to weave mats of rope-yarns for lashings to the boats; he must have a touch of millinery, so as to tie graceful bows and knots, such as Matthew Walker's roses, and Turk's heads; he must {{be a bit of}} a musician, in order to sing out at the halyards; he must be a sort of jeweler, to set dead-eyes in the standing rigging; he must be a carpenter, to enable him to make a jurymast out of a yard in case of emergency; he must be a sempstress, to darn and mend the sails; a ropemaker, to twist <b>marline</b> and Spanish foxes; a blacksmith, to make hooks and thimbles for the blocks: in short, he must be a sort of Jack of all trades, in order to master his own. And this, perhaps, in a greater or less degree, is pretty much the case with all things else; for you know nothing till you know all; which is the reason we never know anything.|$|E

[...] "No, he ain't wonderful; that's not the word. He's a life-preserver, that's wot he is. None o' your hinflated injinrubber or cork affairs, but a reg'lar, hanimated, walkin', self-actin' life-preserver. Why, I've know'd him, off and on, since he was {{the length of a}} <b>marline</b> spike, d'ye see--an' I've seed him save dozens, ay dozens, of lives--men, women, and children,--in lifeboats, an' in luggers, an' swimmin'. Why, he thinks no more o' that wot he's done to-night, than he does of eatin' salt junk. He's got a silver medal from the Royal Life-Boat Institution, an' another from the Queen of Spain, and a gold 'un from some other king or queen, I don't 'xactly know who--besides no end o' thanks, written on paper, also on wot they calls wellum, in beautiful German text and small-hand;--ho! you know, nobody knows wot that feller's been a-doin' of all his life.

6000|$|... "The amazement of our {{visitors}} is very great. Myouk, {{his wife}} and baby, and his son Meetek, are now our guests. When they first came in sight of the brig they uttered a wild shout--the men did so, at least--and tossed their arms and opened their eyes and mouths. They have never shut them since. They go all round the vessel, staring and gaping with amazement. We have given them a number of useful presents, and intend to send them home loaded with gifts for their friends. It is necessary {{to make a good}} impression on them. Our lives depend very much on the friendship of these poor people. We find that they are terrible thieves. A number of knives and a hatchet were missed--they were found hidden in Myouk's sledge. We tried to prevail on Oomia to sell her long boots. To our surprise she was quite willing to part with one, but nothing would induce her to give up the other. One of the men observed her steal a knife out of the cabin and hide it in the leg of her boot. The reason was now plain. We pulled off the boot without asking leave, and found there a large assortment of articles stolen from us. Two or three knives, a spoon, a bit of hoop-iron, and a <b>marline</b> spike. I have tried to make them understand, by signs, that this is very wicked conduct, but they only laugh at me. They are not in the least ashamed, and evidently regard stealing as no sin.|$|E
60|$|I was the {{attendant}} or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of <b>marline</b> between the long yarns of the warp, using my own {{hand for the}} shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn; I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship {{and all over the}} sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance-- aye, chance, free will, and necessity--no wise incompatible-- all interweavingly working together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course-- its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.|$|E
6000|$|As we {{were going}} forward, the second mate {{called one of the}} sailors by name:-"You, Bill?" [...] and Bill answered, [...] "Sir?" [...] just as if the second mate was a born gentleman. It {{surprised}} me not a little, to see a man in such a shabby, shaggy old jacket addressed so respectfully; but I had been quite as much surprised when I heard the chief mate call him Mr. Rigs during the scene on the quarter-deck; as if this Mr. Rigs was a great merchant living in a marble house in Lafayette Place. But I was not very long in finding out, that at sea all officers are Misters, and would take it for an insult if any seaman presumed to omit calling them so. And {{it is also one of}} their rights and privileges to be called sir when addressed--Yes, sir; No, sir; Ay, ay, sir; and they are as particular about being sirred as so many knights and baronets; though their titles are not hereditary, as is the case with the Sir Johns and Sir Joshuas in England. But so far as the second mate is concerned, his tides are the only dignities he enjoys; for, upon the whole, he leads a puppyish We indeed. He is not deemed company at any time for the captain, though the chief mate occasionally is, at least deck-company, though not in the cabin; and besides this, the second mate has to breakfast, lunch, dine, and sup off the leavings of the cabin table, and even the steward, who is accountable to nobody but the captain, sometimes treats him cavalierly; and he has to run aloft when topsails are reefed; and put his hand a good way down into the tar-bucket; and keep the key of the boatswain's locker, and fetch and carry balls of <b>marline</b> and seizing-stuff for the sailors when at work in the rigging; besides doing many other things, which a true-born baronet of any spirit would rather die and give up his title than stand.|$|E
