25|$|The optical {{absorption}} spectrum of pyridine in hexane contains three bands at the wavelengths of 195nm (π→π* transition, <b>molar</b> <b>absorptivity</b> ε=7500L·mol−1·cm−1), 251nm (π→π* transition, ε=2000L·mol−1·cm−1) and 270nm (n→π* transition, ε=450L·mol−1·cm−1). The 1H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectrum of pyridine contains three signals with the integral intensity ratio of 2:1:2 that correspond to the three chemically different protons in the molecule. These signals originate from the α-protons (positions 2 and 6, chemical shift 8.5ppm), γ-proton (position 4, 7.5ppm) and β-protons (positions 3 and 5, 7.1ppm). The carbon analog of pyridine, benzene, has only one proton signal at 7.27ppm. The larger chemical shifts of the α- and γ-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the α- and γ-positions, which {{can be derived from}} the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13CNMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at δ(α-C)=150ppm, δ(β-C)=124ppm and δ(γ-C)=136ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.|$|E
