PD waveform predictions are combined with a noise spectrum estimation to construct matched filters. The PD waveform is specific for each cable circuit under test and the predictions are based on online system identification measurements and a standard cable model. For some cable circuits, for instance with a ring-main-unit along the cable, the predicted waveforms only approximate the real waveforms due to signal distortion not accounted for in the model. This results in suboptimal detection sensitivity. This paper describes an automated procedure for updating the matched filters based on detected PD signals. The algorithm analyzes detected pulses to judge whether the current set of matched filters perform optimally. If not, the current set of matched filters is updated, increasing the PD detection sensitivity and potentially also the location accuracy. At the same time, recognition of recurring disturbances is improved and better rejection criteria can be defined. The method is tested on signals measured on live cable connections...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{industrial process}} to produce <b>medium-voltage</b> electric <b>cables</b> based on EPDM consists of cross-linking by peroxides with high-temperature steam (pressurized water vapor). Suboptimal material cross-linking is usually {{due to a}} decrease of the temperature along the vulcanization pipe. Temperature variations are connected to variations in steam pressure into pipe system. A combined numerical and experimental approach to optimize the production process of <b>medium-voltage,</b> rubber-insulated electric <b>cables</b> vulcanized with steam water is presented. The numerical {{part of this process}} is based on the use of finite elements and an optimization genetic algorithm (GA) and will be presented in Part 2.

In particular, the final cross-linking degree is experimentally obtained by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) determination of nondecomposed peroxide from the external layer to the core of the cable insulation. The final task is to minimize the difference between numerically predicted and experimentally determined cross-linking degree using a steam-temperature profile along the pipe to explain the variations. A preliminary evaluation of kinetic-reaction constants of rubber cured with peroxides is provided with the support of a comprehensive experimental investigation of the curing process by means of standard rheometer characterizations done at different curing temperatures. An existing mathematical, kinetic model is applied to the experimentally determined rheometer curves, allowing the determination of partial-reaction kinetic constants used in the finite-element computations...|$|R

This paper addresses a few of the new challenges related to the integration of these systems in various cable networks. The effect of ring-main-units (RMUs) and substations on the propagation of PD signals is studied to determine feasible options for PD monitoring on two consecutive cables connected through an RMU or a substation. Different algorithms for PD pulse arrival time estimation are analyzed for robustness and PD origin location accuracy. An algorithm based on the signal energy proved to be most suitable for complex circuits where the PD shape is not only distorted by the propagation through the cable, but also by complex impedances in the RMUs along the cable under test and each cable end. Matched filters for PD detection can be improved using measured PD signals. This results in improved detection sensitivity and location accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Online partial {{discharge}} (PD) monitoring systems are traditionally installed {{at a single}} <b>medium-voltage</b> (MV) <b>cable</b> connection between two ring-main-units (RMUs). It is more efficient to monitor two or more consecutive cables using a single monitoring sys-tem. Moreover, practical experience with the PD-OL system [1], shows that for substations, with many paral-lel MV cables, and RMUs installing the inductive sensor may be hampered or even impossible. In this paper the influence of RMUs and substations on the propagation of PDs is studied. An RMU or substation can be mod-eled as a combination of complex impedances represent-ing switchgear, transformer and MV cables. A PD pulse from a cable encounters a load impedance that does not match the cable's characteristic impedance, resulting in partial reflection and partial transmission transmission to other cables. Models for RMUs and substations are pro-posed and verified by measurements. Feasible options for online PD monitoring through RMUs or substations are determined...|$|R
40|$|A comprehensive, combined, {{numerical}} model is presented, based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimization and heat-transfer finite-element computations. The numerical analyses {{were carried out}} to evaluate the final cross-linking degree of a <b>medium-voltage</b> electric <b>cable</b> subjected to industrial peroxide reticulation. The difference between numerically predicted and experimentally determined cross-linking degree along {{the thickness of the}} insulator is then minimized, when a variable steam-temperature profile along the pipe length is assumed to explain the unexpected undervulcanization of the cable in the internal layers. To minimize the gap between the experimentally determined degree of curing and numerical predictions, a GA optimization is used for best fit, instead of the steepest-descendent, standard least-squares, which is not applicable in this case because the objective function is not analytically known. The cable was supposedly vulcanized under four different conditions. The degree of cross-linking is experimentally obtained by determining the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the nondecomposed peroxide from the external layer to the core of the cable. The proposed GA approach exploits a specifically crafted, zooming strategy, consisting of the subdivision of the population at each iteration into two subgroups, depending on the individual's grade of fitness (elitist strategy). The integrated, numerical, experimental approach allows optimization of the amount of peroxide in the compound and comparison of the performances of different peroxide mixtures. The degree of cross-linking compliance can be obtained {{as a function of the}} temperature gradient measured in the steam pipe. Production conditions can be automatically calculated according to the cable parameters, by increasing the quality reliability and reducing the scraps...|$|R
40|$|Transformers {{connected}} at the <b>medium-voltage</b> {{level in}} <b>cable</b> grids, such as wind park collection grids and industrial grids, {{are exposed to}} the stress of very fast transients. These electric transients are mainly generated during breaker switching operations and the rise time of the transient voltage in such systems is much shorter compared to the rise times of transients generated in transmission systems at a high-voltage level. In this paper, the internal voltage stress is studied during very fast transients generated during transformer energization. Instead of using a breaker, the energizing tests are performed using a low-impedance pulse generator that can generate lightning impulse-shaped waveforms and voltage steps with rise times varying between 35 and 500 ns. Experiments show that during very fast transients with a 35 -ns rise time and 1 -p. u. magnitude, the interturn voltage exceeds the level obtained with a lightning impulse-shaped voltage waveform of 4. 4 pu. Furthermore, during a specific switching scenario with delta-connected transformers, where the winding is excited from both ends, the same 1 -p. u. / 35 -ns voltage step generates an interturn voltage that exceeds the 1 -p. u. level, which is more than 2. 5 times higher voltage stress than during a lightning impulse test...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} asset {{age of the}} medium voltage distribution network, more failures are being observed. The ability to understand the source or mechanism of a particular defect {{plays an important role}} in facilitating a more effective diagnostic replacement strategy. This paper investigates the cause of failure in a <b>medium-voltage</b> EPR-insulated underground <b>cable.</b> The cable was taken out of service after breakdown occurred. After a 40 m section was removed for more accurate lab-based analysis, the fault location was pinpointed to within a few centimeters and confirmed as a shunt resistance fault between the core and sheath. This investigation is concerned with a study of observed particle contamination in the EPR layer as it relates to the observed breakdown in the cable. Geometric details of the surrounding dielectric have been acquired using 3 -dimensional X-ray computed tomography techniques. This has revealed details of numerous high-density particles contaminating the dielectric medium. The average particle diameter was around 100 m. To investigate the effect on cable breakdown, the electric field distribution in the region between the core and sheath has been modeled in the presence of contaminating particles using finite element techniques. The field was also modeled in the presence of an observed eccentricity of the core. Electric field variation due to core eccentricity was less severe than that due to particle contamination but slightly increases electric field intensity. It is hypothesized that the particle contamination resulted in a localised electric field sufficient to initiate partial discharge, leading to localised degradation and eventual breakdown...|$|R
40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection and location {{has proven to}} be a valuable tool for assessing the condition of <b>medium-voltage</b> (MV) power <b>cables</b> in service. A few advances are discussed in this paper. It is of importance to know all factors affecting PD activity in order to judge its severity. Cable temperature, more specifically its variation due to load cycling, is one key parameter. From the variation of the signal propagation velocity along the cable it is shown that the temperature can be monitored within one degree centigrade accuracy. The PD activity was found to respond upon temperature cycling caused by load variation. Moreover, data gathered from years of field experience has led to more insight in the predictability of upcoming faults based on (trends in) PD activity. It is possible now to identify the time between the moment {{partial discharge}}s appear (or reach a certain level) and a final breakdown for different types of cable insulation. Occasionally, cable faults occur without being preceded by PD activity. For distribution network operators, a quick location of a MV cable fault, either a direct complete fault or a self-healing (or intermittent) fault, will contribute to reduce the outages both in duration and frequency. The earlier applied PD location technique is extended to capture also faults based on first arrival of the associated transients. This fault pinpointing is possible for any MV power cable type within 1 % of the cable length, independent of the network grounding and whether a fault is a permanent one or a self-healing one.
