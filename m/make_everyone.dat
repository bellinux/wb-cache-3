5|$|A central {{principle}} of mainstream economics is that trade can <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim. Diane Elson, Caren Grown and Nilufer Cagatay explore {{the role that}} gender inequalities play in international trade and how such trade reshapes gender inequality itself. They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.|$|E

Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualitative}} {{review of}} previous literature looking at self-report data suggests {{that men and}} women use impression management tactics in the corporate world that are consistent with stereotypical gender roles when presenting themselves to others. This research proposes that women are put in a double bind where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> aware of possible discrimination.|$|E

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character.

Chris always stays extremely well-hydrated, {{and as a result}} of his extreme exercise regimen has only 2.8% body fat, which makes him very susceptible to illness due to a weakened immune system. His ambition is to become the first human being to live 150 years. Chris always greets people with a firm handshake and direct eye contact, and to remember their names often points directly at people and repeats their names upon first meeting them. His constant desire to <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> around him happy means Chris hates having to deliver bad news, a task he often assigns to his subordinates, usually Ben Wyatt. He often declares things to be [...] "literally" [...] the best thing he's ever seen or done, strongly emphasizing the word and pronouncing it [...] "littrally".

500|$|In July 1974, Revie {{accepted}} {{the offer of}} the England manager's job, succeeding Alf Ramsey and caretaker-manager Joe Mercer. The Football Association, particularly Ted Croker, were impressed with Revie's personality and ideas. He was a popular appointment with the press and supporters; noted journalist Brian Glanville wrote that [...] "Revie was the obvious choice". Revie attempted to build {{a relationship with the}} media, and also invited 81 prospective and established England players to a meeting in Manchester to <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> feel included, where he announced that he would establish extra pay for international players as well as bonus payments for wins and draws. He held a meeting with Alan Hardaker, chairman of the Football League, but Hardaker had long resented Revie and was very reluctant to accept his proposal to rearrange league fixtures to benefit the England team. He also had difficult relationships with figures within the FA, most notoriously with chairman Sir Harold Thompson, who allegedly attempted to influence Revie's team selections and undermine him publicly. As well as this he found difficulty in his attempts to introduce the Leeds traditions into the England camp, such as carpet bowls and bingo, which were met with resentment and disdain by some England internationals. Colin Todd stated that Revie was ill-suited to the England job, with his strengths lying in the day-to-day contact found only in club management rather than the politics and committee meetings of international management.|$|E

[...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings.

500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K.

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would <b>make</b> <b>everyone</b> think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story.

[...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office.

[...] Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist. MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight [...] "misguided". One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads: [...] "I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that [...] "he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on {{the court of public opinion}} and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate".|$|E

Resource monotonicity (more cake to share <b>makes</b> <b>everyone</b> happy) is incompatible with either ESG or NE, and Population Monotonicity (one more mouth to feed <b>makes</b> <b>everyone</b> unhappy) is incompatible with NE.
