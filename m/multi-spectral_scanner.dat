40|$|Direct {{georeferencing}} {{is defined}} as direct measurement of exterior orientation parameters, using positioning and orientation sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS). Imaging sensors, most frequently supported by direct georeferencing, are digital cameras, lidar systems, <b>multi-spectral</b> <b>scanners,</b> or synthetic aperture radar (SAR). While for scanning sensors the use of direct georeferencing is compulsory, frame digital cameras can also directly benefit from this technique of sensor orientation. With direct sensor orientation, the requirement for ground control points (GCP), tie point matching and aerial triangulation (AT) is significantly reduced. The most expensive part of these three requirements is the need of GCP and under exclusion of this part the other two parts are always available for images from digital frame cameras. This paper {{is focused on the}} integration of this existing additional information into the Kalman filter used for direct georeferencing with GPS and INS. The aim is to use the relative orientation information of images extracted with the aid of tie points as an additional update to support the drifting gyros of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) directly like GPS does for the accelerometers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Airborne laser <b>scanners</b> and <b>multi-spectral</b> <b>scanners</b> provide {{information}} on height and spectra that offer exciting possibilities for extracting features in complicated urban areas. We apply an object-based approach to building extraction from image data in an approach that differs from conventional perpixel approaches. Since image objects are extracted based on the thematic and geometric components of objects, quality assessments {{will have to be}} made object-based with respect to these components. The known per-pixel-based methods for assessing quality have been examined in the new situation as well as their limitations. A new framework for carrying out quality assessments by measuring the similarity between the results of feature extraction and reference data is proposed in this paper, The proposed framework consists of both per-object and per-pixel measures of quality, thus providing measures pertaining to qualitative and quantitative measurements of object quality from thematic and geometric aspects. The proposed framework and measures of quality have been applied to an assessment of the results of object-based building extraction using high-resolution laser data and multi-spectral data in two test cases. The results show that the per-object-based method of assessing quality gives additional information to conventional per-pixel, attribute-only assessment methods.

40|$|South Kurdofan {{region was}} known for its high {{potential}} of soil resources. The extent of the region is about 140, 000 km 2. It enjoys a semi-arid climate with high rainfall favouring rainfed agriculture. Traditional agriculture was the main practice of land use beside natural grazing and forestry. The environment was kept in balance. Recently, since the 60 s, the region {{has been subjected to}} unwise mechanized farming, overgrazing and deforestation. This affected the natural resources and led to land degradation. The main objectives of the study are how to solve the problems and to reverse the decline in productivity and to increase production on sustainable basis. The terrain analysis method comprised visual interpretation of satellite data, complemented with ground truth data gained from the field reconnaissance. Preliminary terrain analysis was undertaken using Landsat <b>Multi-Spectral</b> <b>Scannering</b> (MSS). Field reconnaissance to verify the initial interpretation, enabled more precise delineation of the units and provided more information on their physiographic character. Further refinement on the classification system and of the spatial distribution of the units was accomplished using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. Topographic information has been obtained from 1 : 250, 000 and 1, 100, 000 topographic sheets. Twenty eight profiles were dug and sampled for chemical and physical analysis. A total of 29 units which fall in nine physiographic classes have been recognized. However several kinds of soils, because of their sealed surface are given locally the same name "Gardud".

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, United States Forest Service, and National Interagency Fire Center have {{developed}} a partnership to develop and demonstrate technology to improve airborne wildfire imaging and data dissemination. In the summer of 2007, a <b>multi-spectral</b> infrared <b>scanner</b> was integrated into NASA's Ikhana Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) (a General Atomics Predator-B) and launched on four long duration wildfire mapping demonstration missions covering eight western states.

All objectives of the mission demonstrations were achieved. In late October, wind-driven wildfires erupted in five southern California counties.

40|$|Mapping the submerse {{vegetation}} is {{of prime}} {{importance for the}} ecological evaluation of an entire lake. Remote sensing techniques are efficient for such mapping tasks, if the retrieval algorithms and processing methods are robust and mostly independent from additional ground truth measurements. The Modular Inversion Program (MIP) follows this concept. It is a processing tool designed for the recovery of hydro-biological parameters from multi- and hyper-spectral remote sensing data. The architecture of the program consists of physical inversion schemes that derive bio-physical parameters from the measured radiance signal at the sensor. Program modules exist for the retrieval of aerosols, sun glitter correction, atmospheric corrections, retrieval of water constituents among others. For the purpose of mapping the bottom coverage in optically shallow waters, two modules {{have been added to}} MIP. The first module calculates the bottom reflectance using the subsurface reflectance, the depth and an approximation of the water constituent concentrations as input. The second module fractionalizes the bottom reflectance to three endmembers of specific reflectance spectra by linear unmixing. The three endmembers are specific reflectance spectra of bottom sediments, small growing macrophytes (Characeae) and tall macrophytes such as Potamogeton perfoliatus & P. pectinatus. The processing system has been tested with data collected from the <b>multi-spectral</b> airborne <b>scanner</b> Daedalus AADS 1268 at Lake Constance, Germany, for multi- temporal analysis...|$|R
50|$|Each {{spectral}} band had different scientific uses. Band 4 primarily investigated areas of water, {{with the ability}} to detect sediment laden areas and areas of shallow water. Band 5 was primarily used to identify cultural features. Band 6 sensed the vegetation boundaries between land, water, and landforms. Band 7 was the most proficient at sensing through atmospheric haze, and identified water and land boundaries, vegetation, and landforms. The scene size for the scanners of the MSS was 170 km to 185 km, which is the area the sensors could survey per scan. The ground sampling interval of the MSS was 57 m to 79 m, which is medium resolution. Unlike the previous two Landsat missions, a thermal band was built into Landsat 3's <b>Multi-Spectral</b> <b>Scanner,</b> but this instrument failed shortly after the satellite was deployed on July 11, 1978.
