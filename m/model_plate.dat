The single <b>plate</b> <b>model</b> {{is the basis for}} the multiple <b>plates</b> <b>model</b> which we take to be a periodic array of identical plates.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of the paint layer used for {{infrared}} thermography on the heat source estimation for thin plates. The thermal behaviour of two plates is studied using finite element modelling. The first one is composed of the studied homogeneous material. The second one is a sandwich plate composed of a central material covered on each side with a high emissivity paint layer. For the two plates, two thermal loading cases are simulated. Case 1 corresponds to natural cooling from a initial uniform temperature to room temperature. Case 2 corresponds to a situation where the initial uniform temperature is equal to room temperature. In both cases, the central material is loaded with internal heat sources leading to temperature field variation. From the computed external surface temperature, heat sources and energy are then estimated using homogeneous plate and sandwich <b>plate</b> <b>models</b> derived from the heat diffusion equation. Then, the estimated heat sources are compared to the one input in the finite element model. It is shown that the paint layer significantly isolates the central material from the external environment. In case 1, it is shown that the error is reduced from 10 % with the homogeneous <b>plate</b> <b>model</b> to 5 %, with the sandwich <b>plate</b> <b>model.</b> In case 2, heat sources are estimated with an error of less than 8 % with the homogeneous <b>plate</b> <b>model</b> while it is below 2 % with the sandwich <b>plate</b> <b>model.</b> The sandwich <b>plate</b> <b>model</b> is thus significantly more accurate for heat source and energy estimations than the homogeneous <b>plate</b> <b>model...</b>|$|R

It is targeted to graduate students how want to discover <b>plate</b> <b>models</b> but deals also with latest developments on higher order <b>models.</b> <b>Plates</b> <b>models</b> are both an ancient matter and a still active field of research. First attempts {{date back to the}} beginning of the 19 th century with Sophie Germain. Very efficient models have been suggested for homogeneous and isotropic plates by Love (1888) for thin plates and Reissner (1945) for thick plates. However, the extension of such models to more general situations [...] such as laminated plates with highly anisotropic layers [...] and periodic plates [...] such as honeycomb sandwich panels [...] raised a number of difficulties. An extremely wide literature is accessible on these questions, from very simplistic approaches, which are very limited, to extremely elaborated mathematical theories, which might refrain the beginner. Starting from continuum mechanics concepts, this book introduces <b>plate</b> <b>models</b> of progressive complexity and tackles rigorously the influence of the thickness of the plate and of the heterogeneity. It provides also latest research results. The major part of the book deals with a new theory which is the extension to general situations of the well established Reissner-Mindlin theory.
