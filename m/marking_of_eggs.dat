40|$|The Dufour's gland {{is found}} closely {{associated}} with the sting apparatus of all female hymenopterans, playing multiple roles among bees. In some species of Bombus the gland may be involved in production of nestmate recognition pheromones, but in B. terrestris its function is not certain yet. The morphology of the Dufour's gland of B. terrestris queens and the ultrastructural features of its cells were studied in different ages and behavioural stages using routine transmission electron microscopy. Measurements of the length and the diameter of the gland in the same conditions were also made. The Dufour's gland of the queen increases significantly in size (both in length and in diameter) with age and reproductive activity. The ultrastructural features of the gland show electrondense material that comes from the haemolymph. This material is also present in the intercellular spaces, and is conducted to the subcuticular space, to be released directly into the glandular lumen. Hence {{at least part of the}} secretion is probably taken up directly from the haemolymph. The ultrastructural features indicate a more active phase of the gland corresponding to the period of egg-laying of the queen, and a decrease in activity when the queen is in hibernation as well as after the competition point. In conclusion, the gland is probably involved in reproduction, more specifically, in the <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|E

40|$|Eosinophils form 50 % {{of cells}} in the host granulomatous {{response}} to Schistosoma mansoni eggs, but their functional role in these granulomas and their relation to egg destruction is unknown. We have studied the course of S. mansoni infection in mice treated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) or depleted of their eosinophils by monospecific anti-eosinophil serum (AES). At 6 -wk of infection (after 2 wk <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> deposition) the AES-treated animals were similar to NRS-treated controls with the exception that hepatic granulomas in the AES-treated animals were 50 % smaller and devoid of eosinophils.

These data suggest that eosinophil depletion delayed egg destruction.

The methods available for monitoring, reducing, and detecting the spoilage <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> and egg products also are reviewed. [br/][br/][br/]Under healthy breeding conditions, the egg content is generally sterile. It can be contaminated by a diversified microbiota-containing food spoilage microorganisms. Moreover, egg breaking systematically involves the contamination <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> white and egg yolk through contact with the spoiled shells, thus giving rise to highly perishable egg products. This article describes the spoilage characteristic and microbial flora <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and egg products. Additionally, several methodologies are highlighted, allowing for the control, reduction, or detection of the spoilage <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> and egg product...|$|R
