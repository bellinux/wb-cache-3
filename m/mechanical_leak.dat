40|$|LAST {{week was}} Mothers' Day. A perfect {{reminder}} that we owe much {{to this one}} person for bringing us into this world. Intrinsic {{to the understanding of}} the intricate biological process of giving birth is "menstruation". Menstruation can be an indication that pregnancy has not occurred. It is also commonly called "period" because of the periodic flow of blood and cells from the lining of the womb, once every 28 days or so. It lasts three to five days. Interestingly, besides humans, only the great apes exhibit such physiological cycles; what most mammalian species exhibit is called the estrus cycle. But to some, this vital biological process is crudely known as a "leak". Some even draw comparisons to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>leak</b> in the roof of a building. Such insinuations, in jest or otherwise, invariably leave a bad taste in the mouth. They are sexist and boils down to being disrespectful not only to women, but to a bodily function which is finely balanced to ensure the survival of the human species...|$|E

25|$|The {{solid black}} flag {{is used to}} summon a driver to the pits. It is usually {{associated}} with a penalty imposed on the driver for disobeying the rules, but may also be used when a car is suffering a <b>mechanical</b> failure, <b>leaking</b> fluid, exhibiting damage such as loose bodywork, loose hood, dragging bumper, or any other damage that could potentially become a hazard to the driver or other competitors. In some cases, the black flag {{may be used to}} call a driver to the pits when their radio is not working.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a method for characterizing {{membranes}} (ultrafiltration and microfiltration) used in drinking water production. The method accounts for the specific behaviour of microorganisms during filtration, namely their deformation under <b>mechanical</b> stress. The <b>leaks</b> of microorganisms are linked to the presence of a small number of defects or abnormally large pores in the membrane structure. Assuming that the defects are cylindrical capillaries, the range of pore diameters concerned by the method lies between 0. 05 and 1. 2 mm...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 3 Pump {{fugitive}} emissions {{can now be}} controlled to near zero levels {{by the use of}} a simplified dual seal system. A magnetic fluid secondary seal traps any vapors that leak past the primary mechanical seal. This arrangement requires no external support equipment other than venting the vapors to a suitable disposal or recovery system. Magnetic fluid seals have provided hermetic sealing for various gas applications over the last 20 years. One common use is as exclusion seals for magnetic disk drives. Adaptation of this technology to centrifugal pump applications required an extensive development effort. Laboratory tests show maximum emission rates of less than 3. 0 ppm of organic vapors. Field evaluations on process pumps confirm the feasibility of using this technology to achieve strict emission control. Magnetic fluid seals are nonwearing devices. Improved technology allows renewal of the magnetic fluid while the pump is in operation. The magnetic fluid barrier provides a hermetic seal even if the <b>mechanical</b> seal <b>leak</b> rate increases due to wear...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{surgical}} gloves {{used at the}} Royal Hobart Hospital are 'Individually Tested' (IT) gloves, in which each glove is tested for leaks by the manufacturer prior to sterilization and packaging. A cheaper brand of glove is available in which sample gloves from manufactured batches are tested for leaks (BT), but not each glove. The latter gloves were widely rejected by surgeons on the theoretical ground {{that there would be}} more perforations, and consequently more wound infection and greater exposure of staff to patient pathogens. However no objective study had been done to test this conjecture. The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the two brands of gloves by mechanical and microbiological methods, and to compare the incidence of postoperative wound infection following the use of either brand. 110 unused gloves of each brand were tested for leaks. 318 IT and 278 BT gloves were then tested after clean surgery, for <b>mechanical</b> <b>leaks.</b> Scrub-team member's gloves and hands were cultured post-surgery. Wound infection rates were compared. The pre-use perforation rate was not significantly different. The macroperforation rate for if gloves was slightly but statistically significantly higher than for BT gloves, and no bias in types of operations or in staff members could be uncovered to account for this. Growth of normal skin flora was found on virtually every wearer's hands after removal of gloves, suggesting a failure of current scrub techniques or solutions to eliminate skin flora. Furthermore these bacteria were commonly cultured from the outside of the gloves at the conclusion of surgery, indicating development of microporosity of the glove-latex during surgery. There was a statistically significant difference in the glove outer-surface bacterial detection rates between the brands (BT>IT) indicating a difference in latex properties between brands. It is suggested that a standardized form of this test could be developed as a quality measure of surgical gloves. A final finding was the absence of translation of macroperforation rates or bacterial culture rates into morbidity as measured by wound infection. It could be concluded that for this type of surgery, the detected glove differences are irrelevant with regard to patient morbidity. However caution is suggested in extending these findings to situations of known patient infectivity (eg. HIV or viral hepatitis) or to cases where Am contamination could be a serious problem (eg. joint surgery or neurosurgery). The data adds weight to the strategy of double gloving...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a novel means of closing and sealing small type B radioactive material transport packages for surface or air transport as governed by 10 CFR 71 or NUREG- 0360 {{has been developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). This method is a controlled brazing process {{that may be used}} to attach and seal a closure lid to a containment vessel and then remove it at a later time. The process may be performed multiple times without the need for special preparations of the braze joint. A number of advantages for utilization of this technique have been determined. A brazed seal has integrity at high temperatures for better protection in accident or abnormal environments. A properly designed joint has essentially the same strength as the parent metal. A closure that is brazed, therefore, will no longer be the anticipated point of failure for a broad range of accident environments. This technique will allow the containment vessel design to be optimized with a lighter, more uniform wall thickness throughout. Finally, with a well defined process for sealing, <b>mechanical</b> inspection, <b>leak</b> testing, and then reopening at a later time, automation of the process is relatively straightforward and the overall system should be as easy to use as one that utilizes elastomeric seals for containment...|$|R
40|$|Esophageal {{anastomosis}} {{is still}} {{associated with a}} high rate of complications even though they have decreased considerably in recent years. Anastomotic leaks are more frequent in the neck than in the chest, and related mortality rate is not different. The leakage incidence does not depend on suture materials or on technical modalities used to perform the anastomosis. In fact, there is no difference between the leakage rate when comparing manual and <b>mechanical</b> anastomoses. The <b>leak</b> incidence after both mechanical and manual anastomoses is much higher in collective reviews than in reports coming from leading centers. "Frequent" esophageal surgeons can learn from their previous experience and therefore avoid technical errors, whereas "causal" esophageal surgeons do not have this opportunity. Performing an esophageal anastomosis is a technical matter, and suture healing is independent of the patient's biologic situation. Anastomotic fibrotic strictures are frequent after both manual and mechanical anastomoses, and most can be avoided by meticulous suturing technique...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{report the}} outcome of {{artificial}} urinary sphincter (AUS) in female patients {{for the treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence (SUI). PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all female patients with AUS implanted over the last 25 years in one institution. Patient demographics, renal tract imaging and urodynamics assessment were documented. Outcomes measures included complications, duration and cause of AUS failure. Urinary continence was defined as no pad use after AUS insertion. AUS failure was defined as malfunction, infection or erosion. AUS malfunction included either <b>mechanical</b> (fluid <b>leak)</b> or non-mechanical (infection or surgical damage to AUS). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine device failure over time. RESULTS In all, 47 consecutive women with a mean (range) age of 51 (17 - 78) years received an AUS for the treatment of UI. Of these, 35 women had failed anti-incontinence surgery previously. There were two wound infections after AUS insertion but no mortality. Of the 47 AUS implanted, 39 (83 %) AUS remained in situ. Eight (17 %) AUS were removed due to AUS erosion or infection. There were 20 AUS revisions, 16 of which were primary AUS revisions. Most of the AUS revisions were related to mechanical malfunctions. Comparison of the proportion of AUS device survival over time using Kaplan-Meier analysis showed > 80 % of AUS remained functioning after 100 months. At the time of review, 83 % of patients had a device in situ and the continence rate with no pads use was 59 % with AUS only; this figure increased to 85 % when concurrent clean intermittent self-catheterization was performed. CONCLUSIONS AUS is an effective and durable treatment option for female SUI. In properly selected women, high continence rates can be achieved. Most patients maintained satisfactory long-term continence rates despite revision surgery...|$|R
40|$|The poor {{durability}} of concrete bridges throughout the US is an increasingly large concern for highway transportation authorities. With decreasing budget allocations for infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement, {{the need for}} greater durability is apparent. A main source of this poor durability is <b>leaking</b> <b>mechanical</b> expansion joints between adjacent simple spans of multi-span bridges. These joints typically require {{a large number of}} expensive maintenance or replacement projects over the service life of the bridge. Using micromechanically designed ECC (Engineered Cementitious Composite) with a tensile ductility four hundred times that of normal concrete, expansion joints can be replaced by ECC link slabs, forming a jointless multi-span bridge. Utilizing the large tensile strain capacity and inherently tight microcracking properties of ECC, these link slabs maintain the simple span performance of the bridge while accommodating mechanical and environmental (i. e thermal) loads typically accounted for by the expansion joints. ECC link slabs allow for a joint free bridge deck, eliminating leaking problems which lead to low durability while creating a smoother riding surface. Design procedures and experimental testing of link slabs is reviewed and an ongoing field demonstration in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Transportation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{experiment}} {{is a general}} purpose detector being operated at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) facility at CERN. The RE 4 upgrade project was envisaged to improve the Level- 1 trigger efficiency in the forward region, when LHC would run at its full designed energy and luminosity after the first Long Shutdown (LS- 1, 2013 - 2014). About 200 RPCs were built for the upgrade at three assembly sites in India, CERN and Ghent. India contributed to 50, RE 4 / 2 RPCs along with 200 Cu-cooling units for the entire upgrade for which the assembly and characterization of RPCs was carried out jointly by Nuclear Physics Division-BARC and Panjab University-Chandigarh. The gas-gaps after their arrival from KODEL, South Korea, underwent <b>mechanical</b> tests for <b>leak</b> and popped spacers, followed by electrical tests for long term monitoring of leakage currents. After the assembly, each RPC was evaluated for its efficiency, cluster size, noise and strip profiles. The Cu-cooling units build at BARC were also tested according to the quality control protocols for any leakage. All the relevant data was uploaded onto the CMS-RPC data base prior to dispatch of RPCs to CERN. At CERN, the RE 4 / 2 type and RE 4 / 3 type RPCs were assembled to a Super Module (SM), which was further tested for the leaks in the Cu-cooling systems. The SMs were then transported to Point 5 and both the End Caps (Â± RE 4) were successfully installed and commissioned {{in the summer of}} 2014...|$|R
40|$|Feed-through {{connectors}} {{are used}} in the electronics industry to route electrical current into isolated environments. Electrically insulating glasses are used to separate metals from each other to form leak tight glass-to-metal seals. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) are controlled to reduce thermomechanical stresses in the seal. The majority of glass-to-metal seals consist of stainless steel housings and pins bonded to silicate-based glasses. Titanium and its alloys are alternative housing materials due to their low density and thus weight saving potential. Silicate-based glasses form weak and brittle interlayers when bonded to titanium, so borate-based glasses {{are used in}}stead. Glasses are replaced with glass-ceramics due to improved toughness and refractory performance whilst allowing the CTE to be controlled. A knowledge gap is present as few heat treatments are published to manufacture robust glass-ceramic-to-metal seals with a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V housing. Hermetic glass-ceramic-to-metal seals were required to incorporate a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V housing and an electrically conducting pin, to survive for up to 30 years at standard laboratory conditions (20 ± 10 °C / 30 ± 20 %RH). The manufacture and testing of glass-ceramic-to-metal seals was divided into three parts: seal development, characterisation, and ageing. Hermetic seals were made between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, a strontium boroaluminate glass-ceramic and an oxidised Kovar pin with a helium leak rate less than 1 × 10 - 9 mbar l s- 1. Kovar was selected as the pin material predominantly due to the low CTE. Differential thermal analysis and push-rod dilatometry were used to tailor the CTE of the glass-ceramic (8. 4 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 °C- 1) between the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V housing (10. 1 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 °C- 1) and the oxidised Kovar pin (7. 4 ± 0. 1 × 10 - 6 °C- 1). The CTEs were measured between 30 °C and 600 °C. The Kovar pin was oxidised in air at 700 °C for 10 minutes. The seal was heat treated in an argon atmosphere that peaked with an isothermal hold at 800 °C for 20 minutes, specifically to tailor the CTE of the glass-ceramic. Seals were reproducible in terms of hermeticity, microstructure and <b>mechanical</b> strength. Reproducible <b>leak</b> tight seals were manufactured in batches of 5 seals. A reproducible microstructure of the seal was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The seals had a load at failure of 1510 ± 10 N. Seals were aged between 20 – 85 °C, 35 – 93 %RH, for up to 32 weeks. There was no change in the hermeticity of the seals as a function of ageing time or temperature. The surface of the glass-ceramic aged at 85 °C / 93 %RH was degraded by contact with water vapour at a rate of 5 ± 1 μm yr- 1. The resulting strontium enriched layer was mechanically weak. There was a 1 % change in the load at failure of the seals, aged as a function of time and temperature, which was accounted for by natural variation within the samples. Thus, the seals developed in this study are expected to remain hermetic following tens of years of ageing at standard laboratory conditions...|$|R
