5|$|The third {{variation}} {{added by}} Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived {{as one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>beloved</b> passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.|$|E
