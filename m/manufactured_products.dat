5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most <b>manufactured</b> <b>products</b> were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, slaughtering, paper making, machining, and tobacco processing. Other industries including {{the manufacture of}} paint, bricks, and iron. During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its <b>manufactured</b> <b>products,</b> and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most other industries suffered similar declines.|$|E
40|$|This pioneer {{research}} for Pakistan uses monthly time series {{data for the}} period of 1997 - 1 to 2008 - 4 to determine the causal relationship between the money supply, food prices and <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices in developing country like Pakistan. Empirical analysis is performed by using the ARDL and Toda Yamamoto causality test. The results show that the bidirectional causality between the food prices and money supply and unidirectional causality from money supply to <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices. On the other hand there is no causal relationship between the food prices and <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices. The important finding {{of this study is that}} food prices response faster then the <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices to a change in money supply in the Pakistan. ...|$|R

An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35–55kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although {{the cost of the}} war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with <b>manufactured</b> <b>products,</b> which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E
5|$|Wolin was {{the major}} stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, {{comprising}} the island and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include {{a great variety of}} imported goods (even from the Far East) and locally <b>manufactured</b> <b>products</b> and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite.|$|E

Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including hazardous substances), <b>manufactured</b> <b>products,</b> food, living organisms and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.
