5|$|The {{capital of}} Slovakia is the eighth best city for freelancers to live in, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> fast {{internet}} and low taxes. In 2017, Bratislava was ranked {{as the third}} richest region of the European Union by GDP (PPP) per capita (after Hamburg and Luxembourg City). GDP at purchasing power parity is about three times higher than in other Slovak regions.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the high operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, the market was not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton and Stamford {{branches}} {{prepare for}} the upcoming merger. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) professes excitement over the merger, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the return of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). She soon learns throughout the day that Jim has become slightly distant at her {{and that he has}} formed a close relationship with Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), visibly shaking her. Feeling bad with their awkward reunion, Jim catches up to Pam {{at the end of the}} day and informs her that he's seeing someone. While Pam assures him that they're still friends, Jim leaves shaken as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles {{are commonly used}} for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material {{away from the}} continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|In {{national}} context, {{the town}} is <b>mostly</b> known <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the homonymous motorway interchange between the E30, E231 and E232. This interchange is an important hub for north- and eastbound traffic in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} unable to {{replicate}} its form in the 1947–48 season, occupying 11th place on its conclusion in May 1948. Despite that, Liddell reached double figures {{with a total of}} 11 goals. He accompanied the club when it embarked on its second exhibition tour of North America. His displays against Sweden's Djurgården, played at the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ebbets Field, and North American teams earned him praise from journalists and gained him 13 goals in 11 matches. In the 1948–49 season, Liddell occupied left back and four forward positions. During his career, he would fill all ten outfield roles, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> injuries to other players. His brother, Tom, became a teammate in 1949 after Liverpool signed him from Lochore Welfare. He never represented the club as a senior. The club finished in eighth in the 1949–50 season, going undefeated for a post-First World War record of 19 consecutive matches. Liddell scored ten goals in seven of those matches, including three braces.|$|E
50|$|Having never {{previously}} met, {{the three}} sisters, who {{have very different}} personalities, agree to the strange situation (<b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> each <b>of</b> their 1/3rd share is worth eight million dollars), despite having reservations about their forced family 'reunion'. The biggest problem the women face, however, is {{the discovery of a}} saboteur in their midst.|$|R
50|$|When the Fire Mummies were {{discovered}} in the early 20th century, {{many of them were}} thieved, because the caves were <b>mostly</b> unprotected. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, Monument Watch, a nonprofit organization, declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} thrust vs drag asymmetry, the {{countering}} of induced yaw {{was a more}} complicated matter. At low airspeed, it was calculated to be <b>mostly</b> alleviated <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a phenomenon known as P-factor, while at normal airspeed {{it proved to be}} easily controlled with trimming.|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{first took}} an {{interest}} in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began {{in the wake of his}} failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of November 8–9, 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year. Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs. He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organizer in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{levels on}} the main streets are high, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> noisy diesel buses.|$|E
25|$|The style {{raised some}} criticism, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> the {{overlapping}} <b>of</b> rooms and spaces on a reduced area. This characteristic, however, adds contextual {{value to the}} townscape where the chalets are homogeneously grouped, usually semi-detached.|$|R
50|$|The {{soils are}} {{generally}} poor, {{except on the}} plains, where areas with natural grass, fertile soils and warm summers {{provide an opportunity for}} tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is <b>mostly</b> unsuccessful <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the mountains, hot summers and poor soils, although certain cultures such as olive and grape flourish.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, ecotourism {{has become a}} major aspect of the economy. Huasca de Ocampo was the first in Hidalgo state {{to become part of the}} federal Pueblos Mágicos (Magical Towns) tourism program, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> the town’s old buildings remain and the pace of life has changed very little here since the first half of the 20th century.|$|R
25|$|The little {{copies of}} the Mandelbrot set are all {{slightly}} different, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the thin threads connecting them to {{the main body of}} the set.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{conversion}} rate in Taiwan is relatively low {{since most of}} the Taiwanese Muslims in general do not actively preach their religion as do believers of other religions.

25|$|The liturgy of Damascus {{differed}} {{from that of}} Aleppo in some details, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its greater proximity to the Holy Land. Some of the laws specific to Eretz Yisrael are regarded as extending to Damascus, and the city had ties both to the Safed Kabbalists and to the Jerusalem Sephardic community.|$|E
50|$|Bartensleben is {{a village}} {{and a former}} {{municipality}} in the Börde district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2010, {{it is part of}} the municipality Erxleben.

50|$|The {{opening day}} of the season saw Wimbledon lose 3-0 at home to Manchester United in a game <b>mostly</b> remembered <b>because</b> <b>of</b> David Beckham's late goal from inside his own half, but Wimbledon got their own back of United later on in the season by {{eliminating}} them from the FA Cup.|$|R
50|$|In the 2012-13 season Bahoken {{started to}} receive first-team appearances, mostly coming on as a substitute. His season, however, was <b>mostly</b> overshadowed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his {{fractured}} fibula, which sustained {{in training and}} was out for several month. While playing in the club reserves, he was suspended for three games after an incident off the pitch.|$|R
