On the May 1 episode of SmackDown, however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel chair.

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

She forms strong friendships with Cindy and Lindsey, whom she bonded with over Doctor Browning's death, and helps Cindy's daughter Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham) when she suspects Cindy has had a mental breakdown. Mercedes also helps Theresa, who is serving a prison sentence for Calvin's murder after his brother Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine) had tricked Carmel into reporting Theresa to the police, to escape by forcing a heavily pregnant Theresa to fake labour. Mercedes enters the hospital dressed as a doctor and helps Theresa escape, but Sonny tracks them down.

40|$|Readers {{must seek}} for {{permission}} to reproduce this workThis paper will report on research on different design aspects of museum displays in a permanent and a mobile museum context. This research has been undertaken {{in order to understand}} how different aspects of museum displays contribute to meaning <b>making.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> at the interrelationship between different design elements and how these influence meaning making. Drawing on Kress and van Leeuwen's (1996; 2001) theory of multimodal discourse and on recent research on communication in museums (Ravelli: 2006; Meng in O'Halloran: 2006), this study considers why it is apposite to consider museums as multimodal, co-deploying different modes to make meaning. The paper investigates the design elements employed in museum displays, which include: linguistic design (labels and captions); visual design (objects on display, photographs and drawings); audio design (video recordings) and spatial design (lay-out of the display). The paper discusses a multimodal analysis of the rock art and rock engraving displays, drawing on inter alia the work of Kress and van Leeuwen (1996; 2001), which is done with the intention of formulating a metalanguage. It is envisaged that this metalanguage will enable museum practitioners and educators to talk about and better understand meaning making in museum displays and contribute to current debates on communication and meaning making in museums...|$|R

40|$|Everyone {{wants to}} live in a healthy environment, an idea that has always been closely {{associated}} with the healthy landscape. Pretoria CBD is no longer a place that offers such a landscape; it is congested, fragmented and placeless. People move far and wide to get away from its hostile environments, chasing after the high gloss images of nature displayed on the billboards and posters of suburbia. They race to find a patch of land within the security complexes and estates of the east, all the while being savagely pursued by the evils of urban sprawl and decentralization. Surely there must be a way of addressing mans need and desire for landscape without perpetuating urban problems and destroying the very nature they strive for? In order to ensure a sustainable future for Pretoria needs to investigate new ways to deal with the urban problems of sprawl and decay. This thesis explores the potential of using landscape as the basis with which one can reorder and reconstruct the urban form {{in a way that will}} offer people the ideals they search within a sustainable urban environment. The investigation starts at a regional scale in order to holistically address urban issues and identify opportunities and then works its way across a range of scales down to detail design and place <b>making.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> new methods of constructing contemporary landscapes not by mere superimposition but by working with the current and historic urban fabric as well as the social, historical and environmental processes that have shaped it over time. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> to the far from idyllic, yet brutally honest, post-industrial landscape of Pretoria West to construct hybrid landscapes.

It appeared under the English title A Treatise of the System of the World. This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the Principia.
