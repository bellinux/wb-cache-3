5|$|After {{holding out}} in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition was now in short supply and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had not eaten for over twenty-four hours.|$|E
5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down {{over the course of}} the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had been killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Within days, Frederick's {{army had}} reconstituted itself. Approximately 26,000 men—most of the survivors—were {{scattered}} over the territory between Kunersdorf and Berlin. Four days after the battle, though, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> turned up at the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick's army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.|$|E

50|$|A week {{following}} the surrender, Antonio López de Santa Anna ordered <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured <b>men.</b> Colonel Fannin, Burr Duval and almost 400 other men were executed on March 27 in {{what became known}} as the Goliad Massacre.|$|R
5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|The Americans buried {{their dead}} and resumed the retreat, the Indians and British rangers {{pursuing}} and firing occasionally from at long range. Williamson and Rose kept <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> together by warning them that an orderly retreat was their only {{chance to get}} home alive. The Americans fell back more than , some on foot, before making camp. The next day, two American stragglers were captured and presumably killed before the Indians and rangers finally abandoned the chase. The main body of Americans reached Mingo Bottom on June 13. Many stragglers arrived in small groups for several days more. In all, about 70 Americans never returned from the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery, more {{commonly}} known as the Airborne Cemetery, is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in Oosterbeek, near Arnhem, the Netherlands. It was established in 1945 and is home to 1759 graves from the Second World War. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> buried in the cemetery were Allied servicemen killed in the Battle of Arnhem, an Allied attempt to cross the Rhine in 1944, or in the liberation of the city the following year. Men killed in these battles are still discovered in the surrounding area even in the 21st century, and so the number of people interred in the cemetery continues to grow.|$|E
50|$|Cortés, Alvarado and {{the strongest}} and <b>most</b> skilled <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had managed to fight {{their way out of}} Tenochtitlan, {{although}} they were all bloodied and exhausted.

25|$|The three college {{students}} who drove Araujo to the hospital testified as to her state of terror when they encountered her. The four defendants were convicted of aggravated rape; charges against two additional <b>men</b> were dropped. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> served was 6½ years.|$|R
5|$|The retreat {{continued}} until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender {{negotiations with the}} British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan. On 15 May <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were transported to Rimini in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other prisoners of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.|$|E
5|$|At {{any given}} time, Treblinka I had a {{workforce}} of 1,000–2,000 prisoners, {{most of whom}} worked 12- to 14-hour shifts in the large quarry and later also harvested wood from the nearby forest as fuel for the open-air crematoria in Treblinka II. There were German, Czech and French Jews among them, as well as Poles captured in łapankas, farmers unable to deliver food requisitions, hostages trapped by chance, and people who attempted to harbour Jews outside the Jewish ghettos or who performed restricted actions without permits. Beginning in July 1942, Jews and non-Jews were separated. Women mainly worked in the sorting barracks, where they repaired and cleaned military clothing delivered by freight trains, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> worked at the gravel mine. There were no work uniforms, and inmates who lost their own shoes were forced to go barefoot or scavenge them from dead prisoners. Water was rationed, and punishments were regularly delivered at roll-calls. From December 1943 the inmates were no longer carrying any specific sentences. The camp operated officially until 23 July 1944, when the imminent arrival of Soviet forces led to its abandonment.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1861, forty-seven Indiana regiments had mustered into service; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> enlisted for {{terms of}} three years. The {{majority}} of the three-year regiments were deployed in the western theater. In 1862 another forty-one regiments from Indiana were mustered into service; about half {{were sent to the}} eastern theater and the other half remained in the west. During 1863 six more regiments were mustered into service to replace the casualties of the first two years' fighting, and on July 8, 1863, and additional thirteen temporary regiments were established during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana. The men in these temporary regiments enlisted for terms of three months, but the regiments disbanded once the threat posed by Morgan's troops was gone. In 1864 twenty-one Indiana regiments mustered into service. As the fighting declined, most of Indiana's regiments mustered out of service by the end of 1864, but some continued to serve. During 1865 fourteen additional Indiana regiments were mustered into a year of service. On November 10, 1865, the 13th Regiment Indiana Cavalry became the state's final regiment to be mustered out of the U.S. Army.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{battalion}} now {{arrived and}} went into action. Turrill's flanks lay unprotected and the Marines were rapidly exhausting their ammunition. By the afternoon, however, the Marines had captured Hill 142, {{at a cost of}} nine officers and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 325 <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battalion.|$|R
5|$|During 1964–65 the {{regiment}} provided <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> for 1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse, which was subsequently {{equipped with the}} new M113A1 Armoured Personnel Carrier and was deployed on active service to South Vietnam in May 1965. In October 1967 the Australian government announced it would {{increase the size of}} the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province from two to three infantry battalions, while additional supporting arms, including a tank squadron would also be added to the force. As such in February 1968, C Squadron was sent to Vietnam, with a total strength of 20 Centurion tanks which would work closely with the M113s of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. However, two of the four tank troops were initially held back until the Centurions had proved themselves capable of operating in the conditions. The tank squadron reached full strength on 5 September 1968. Meanwhile, in May {{the regiment}} had again reached full strength, with A Squadron re-raised {{in order to meet the}} ongoing operational commitment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} year, 736, Asad's forces cleared the {{mountains}} of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. The fortress of Tabushkhan, where many of Harith's followers and relatives had found refuge, was besieged by Juday' al-Kirmani. After they surrendered, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were executed, while the rest were sold into slavery. Harith himself {{on the other hand}} continued to escape capture. In 737, Asad led his troops again north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While the Arab troops were dispersed ravaging the countryside, the Turgesh khagan Suluk, responding to the pleas for help by the Khuttalan king, launched an attack that precipitated a headlong flight back by Asad's army across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and captured the Arab baggage train on 1 October, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Harith now emerged from hiding and joined the khagan.|$|E
5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 1842, {{the second}} {{organized}} wagon train {{set out from}} Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers. The party was led by Elijah White.

Herodotus mentions that Damasithymus was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> noted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> commanding <b>the</b> Persian ships.|$|R
50|$|Abraham Salomon Gluck was {{probably}} murdered, alike <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 878 <b>men</b> in convoy 73, on or around 20 May 1944.

5|$|On May 5, {{the same}} day that Davis officially {{dissolved}} the Confederate Government in Washington, Georgia, Breckinridge discharged <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion that would allow him to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force's commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now Lakeland) by May 11 and remained there for a few days. Learning of Davis's capture, he left Milltown with only a military aide, a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in Madison, Florida, he was joined by fellow fugitive John Taylor Wood, who had been a captain in the Confederate Navy. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the Bahamas, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquito bites, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.|$|E
5|$|One of A Company's platoons, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Ray Bixler, faced most of the {{pressure}} of the North Korean assault. Tank fire had destroyed the American wire communications to their artillery, which began to fall on their own positions in the belief that they had been overrun with North Koreans, before Stephens was able to call it off. In the meantime, at 1135 Bixler's platoon was surrounded and destroyed, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the platoon were killed in their foxholes by the North Korean infantry. Following this, men on the right flank began deserting their positions regardless of Stephens' efforts to keep them there. Finally at 1205, Stephens ordered his men to withdraw. American forces had great difficulty retreating through the wet rice paddies, and a disorganized retreat followed as they attempted to pull back. During the retreat, several U.S. aircraft returned and, mistaking the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry for North Koreans, began to strafe them. The aircraft inflicted no casualties, but the battalion overall had suffered 20 percent casualties with 33 killed and 35 wounded during the engagement, as well as 14 killed in the mortar company.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E

50|$|Each LSM {{carried a}} crew of 4 Officers and 47 other ranks, when on {{operations}} in Vietnam. While <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manning</b> was RAE, members of other Corps were also part of each crew, including medical, signals and ordnance. In Vietnam, the ships were fitted with a 40mm gun and several machine guns for protection. Signallers who served with the 32 Small Ship Squadron all became experienced ship Radio Operators who adapted to ships life, working both with the RAN and Army units in Vietnamese waters, without much support from RASigs. 32 Small Ship Squadron Headquarters (HQ) never left Australia and was located in Sydney. Once the ships sailed from their Sydney Base, operational control was RAN via the Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSTFLT). In Vietnam waters the tasking was HQ Australian Vietnam Force (AFV) via HQ 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1ALSG).|$|R
50|$|Brown {{was born}} in Leigh, in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lancashire coalfield.

He joined the Lancashire Miners' Federation and the Labour Representation Committee in 1903.|$|R
5|$|Soon North Korean rifle fire {{came in on}} the {{dispersed}} men and E and F Companies {{immediately began}} withdrawing in a disorderly manner. Troops began shying from the front and retreating without orders, ignoring officers' commands to stay in position. Colonel Horton V. White, the regimental commander, heard of the difficulty and drove hurriedly to the scene. He found the battalion coming back {{down the road in}} disorder and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in a state of panic. Historians blame the retreat as much on officers' ineptitude as individual soldiers panicking. He mustered the men and ordered a retreat but by then many soldiers were withdrawing on their own. The next day the ROK 17th Regiment enveloped the North Korean position that had launched the attack and captured two light machine guns, one mortar, and about 30 North Koreans who appeared to be guerrillas. The ROK 17th Regiment fought in the hills for the next two days, making some limited gains, and then it moved back to Sangju to join other units as part of the ROK Army reorganization in progress around Pusan. This left only the US 24th Infantry Regiment guarding the west approach to Sangju from the Mun'gyong plateau.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army Ranger Company was {{deactivated}} on 31 March 1951. Some of its {{equipment was}} subsequently consolidated with the 5th Ranger Infantry Company, which was newly arrived in Korea {{and had been}} assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. The men of the new Ranger company had formally attended Ranger School, though they were inexperienced and less effective in their initial actions with the division. In the meantime, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the former Eighth Army Ranger Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division, while those who were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other Ranger companies then beginning to arrive in Korea. During its brief existence, the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|While the {{division}} was never deployed overseas, its headquarters staff was deployed to Norway and briefly {{fought in the}} Norwegian Campaign. Afterwards, {{the division}} was deployed to Northern Ireland for almost three years {{as a result of}} rumours of a German intention to invade. In Northern Ireland, the division manned static defences, conducted internal security, and trained for future operations. Returning to England, the division participated in numerous military exercises and was scheduled to join the 21st Army Group for the Operation Overlord; the Allied invasion of German-occupied France. By late 1943, this role had been taken away from the division and it was assigned to train replacements for combat units. Throughout 1944, the division aided Overlord in various deception formats while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were posted to combat formations within 21st Army Group. In late 1945, the division was re-organized as a light division and was going to be deployed to the Far East to fight Imperial Japan. The Japanese surrender resulted in the move not being made, and in November the division was disbanded.|$|E
