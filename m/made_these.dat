5|$|In October 1944 the {{production}} of Tiefland moved to Barrandov Studios in Prague for interior filming. Lavish sets <b>made</b> <b>these</b> shots {{some of the most}} costly of the film. The film was not edited and released until almost ten years later.|$|E
5|$|A second {{overhaul}} of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy had found 20mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes <b>made</b> <b>these</b> manually controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40mm Bofors mounts were fitted. Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40mm and eighteen 20mm guns. Colorados quad 40s were increased to forty {{but she kept}} all her 20mm guns. West Virginia carried forty quad 40mm and fifty 20mm. guns.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese {{aircraft}} downed were {{credited to}} this weapon, {{with the high}} point being 48.3% {{for the second half}} of 1942. In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which <b>made</b> <b>these</b> guns even more effective; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40mm Bofors AA guns.|$|E

5|$|Children {{were also}} {{affected}} through {{the loss of}} parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has <b>made</b> <b>these</b> children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death {{of one of the}} at least ten orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls <b>made</b> <b>these</b> fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|Krasnyi Kavkaz {{continued}} to ferry reinforcements into Sevastopol. During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed {{into the harbor}} of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941, landed reinforcements, and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. In early January 1942, she was severely damaged by German dive bombers. She made it to Novorossiysk, escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi, where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs could be <b>made.</b> <b>These</b> took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century <b>made</b> <b>these</b> businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has <b>made</b> <b>these</b> masterly studies of human nature and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the rations. In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They <b>made</b> <b>these</b> drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E

5|$|The {{heightened}} vigilance of the German garrison {{as the war}} entered {{its final}} phase <b>made</b> <b>these</b> operations especially hazardous, particularly as they were often attempted at extremely close quarters. On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery. During one action, two Rhodesian patrols catered {{for the possibility that}} Germans might be listening to their transmissions by communicating in Shona, an African language. The LRDG's last actions of the war, in April and May 1945, were to help Tito's partisans capture German-held islands off Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have <b>made</b> <b>these</b> sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed changes have been <b>made.</b> <b>These</b> will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes have been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1900 hurricane, Galveston {{adopted a}} {{commission}} government (in 1960 {{the city would}} switch to council-manager system). At the beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice; though the council members were tolerant of small-scale activities which {{had always been a}} part of the city, they were more concerned about organized crime. As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and <b>made</b> <b>these</b> businesses more respectable, the council became far more accepting of the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy. According to some reports this was because the Maceos bought the cooperation of the council members, taking advantage of easily corruptible structure of the commission.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted {{to throw away}} a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new as he <b>made</b> <b>these</b> allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him to throw away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and <b>made</b> <b>these</b> four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E

The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E
5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was {{originally}} released in Japan by Spike on December 10, 2009, for the Nintendo DS. An American release followed on November 16, 2010. In the United States, {{a replica of}} the in-game bracelets was included with pre-orders at GameStop; due to low pre-orders, Aksys <b>made</b> <b>these</b> available on their website's shop, both separately and bundled with the game. Upon release, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors became the eleventh Nintendo DS game to be rated M by the ESRB. Coinciding with the release of the game's sequel, , Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors got a reprint titled Zero Escape: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, with new box art featuring the Zero Escape brand. The game's soundtrack was published by Super Sweep on December 23, 2009. A novelization of the game, titled Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9 Jikan 9 Nin 9 no Tobira Arutana, was written by Kenji Kuroda and released by Kodansha in two volumes in 2010: Ue and Shita.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation <b>made</b> <b>these</b> items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
