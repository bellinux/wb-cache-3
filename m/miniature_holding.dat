50|$|The {{museum has}} an {{extensive}} collection of ceilings, frescoes, stained glass, illuminated manuscripts, porcelain statuettes, reliquary {{wood and metal}} shrines and crosses, and Gothic boxwood <b>miniatures.</b> It <b>holds</b> liturgical vessels, and rare pieces of Gothic furniture and metalwork. Many are not associated with a particular architectural setting, so their placement in the museum may vary.|$|R
5000|$|Repositioning {{body parts}} {{such as the}} head, arms or torso of a {{miniature}} figure {{is one of the}} simplest types of conversion. [...] Another simple technique is weapon swapping. [...] Weapons can be taken from sprues or other miniatures and used to replace whatever weapon the converted <b>miniature</b> is <b>holding</b> to create any variety of distinctive commanders.|$|R

50|$|Medieval hagiographies, {{such as the}} Legenda sanctorum, {{record that}} St. Catherine of Alexandria was {{executed}} {{on one of these}} devices for refusing to renounce her Christian belief, which thereafter became known as the Catherine wheel, also used as her iconographic attribute. The wheel miraculously broke when she touched it; she was then beheaded. As an attribute it is usually shown broken in a small version beside her, or sometimes as a <b>miniature</b> she <b>holds</b> in her hand; the sword then used is also often shown.|$|R
5000|$|Conversions {{can also}} be used to give {{miniature}}s flags, banners or pennants if desired. [...] A banner can be added to a miniature bearing a pike or spear, or a flagstaff can be made from a brass rod, which is quite rigid. [...] In the latter case, any weapon the <b>miniature</b> is <b>holding</b> must be cut away and the fist drilled out to allow it hold the wire pole. [...] The banner itself can be made from paper and painted with PVA glue, which stiffens sufficiently as it dries. [...] The banner is then glued to the pole and painted.|$|R
50|$|There {{are dozens}} of {{miniature}} trade shows held throughout the year by various miniature organizations and enthusiasts, where artisans and dealers display and sell miniatures. Often, how-to seminars and workshops {{are part of the}} show features. <b>Miniature</b> stores also <b>hold</b> classes. Enthusiasts share images online and use Internet forums, blogs and other online social media to share information about dollhouses and miniatures.|$|R
50|$|To start, {{the winner}} of the {{qualifying}} round was given a <b>miniature</b> building to <b>hold,</b> worth $10,000 ($5,000 in the second season). The contestant then faced a game board consisting of four other buildings. The buildings were each a different color which corresponded to the colors of ten blocks lined {{up in front of the}} contestant. Each block concealed a different number from one to ten, arranged randomly.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric entry probes {{present a}} unique {{opportunity}} for performing quantitative analysis of extra-terrestrial atmospheres in cases where remote sensing alone may not be sufficient and measurements with balloons or aircraft is not practical. An entry probe can provide a complete vertical profile of atmospheric parameters including chemical composition, which cannot be obtained with most other techniques. There are, however, unique challenges associated with building instruments for an entry probe, as compared to orbiters, landers, or rovers. Conditions during atmospheric entry are extreme, there are inherent time constraints due to the short duration of the experiment, and the instrument experiences rapid environmental changes in temperature and pressure as it descends. In addition, there are resource limitations, i. e. mass, power, size and bandwidth. Finally, the demands on the instrument design are determined {{in large part by}} conditions (pressure, temperature, composition) unique to the particular body under study, and as a result there is no one-size-fits-all instrument for an atmospheric probe. Many of these requirements can be more easily met by miniaturizing the probe instrument. Our experience building mass spectrometers for atmospheric entry probes leads us to believe that the time is right for a fundamental change in the way spaceflight mass spectrometers are built. The emergence over the past twenty years of Micro-electro- mechanical Systems (MEMS), utilizing lithographic semiconductor fabrication techniques to produce instrument systems in <b>miniature,</b> <b>holds</b> great promise for application to spaceflight mass spectrometry. A highly miniaturized, high performance and low-power mass spectrometer would be an enormous benefit to future entry probe missions, allowing, for example, parallel measurements (e. g., multiple simultaneous gas chromatographic analyses and direct atmospheric leaks.) Such an instrument would also enable mass spectrometry on board small multiple entry probes. In the development of a MEMS Mass Spectrometer, the challenge facing us is to move beyond the proof-of-concept, where research dollars tend to focus, and carry out the detailed work of developing a high performance mass spectrometer system on a chip which meets the unique technical requirements for an atmospheric entry probe described above...|$|R
40|$|In their 2010 anniversary show, Rugby Art Gallery and Museum {{profiled}} two of Judith Cowan's sculptures ‘Who {{are these}} people?’ 2005, and ‘Melancholia exists’, 2003. with several related recent work, (including Cowan's Memory {{of a place}} in Rome). Judith Cowan’s fascination with the filmic scene is evident within both the sculptures and the drawing. The audience sees things, then, the roles flip as they discover {{they are in the}} scene with other people passing and interacting with the work. Who are these people? 2005, uses a wooden model to place the viewer in a theatre-like set before, after and literally behind the scene. Its <b>miniature</b> frame <b>holds</b> an amber, translucent panel that creates a window or film frame. This integrates a constant changeability to whatever the viewer sees through the aperture. ‘Melancholia exists’, 2003, shows the living past tries to cling to the present. The old white chest of drawers support a plaster cast of the vestiges of space between a body and its arms. Its amber, perspex cover, makes it appear almost living from the sides, whilst the opening at the top reveals a white in-between space like a hollowed out rock. Window sash-cords spill out of drawers, some opening to occupy the space of the viewer, so they begin to occupy an inter-space between theatrical prop and art object...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} that require long wavelength, large, uniform, reproducible, low cost, stable, and radiation-hard infrared (IR) focal plane arrays (FPAs). For example, the absorption lines of many gas molecules, such as ozone, water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide {{occur in the}} wavelength region from 3 to 18 micron. Thus, IR imaging systems that operate in the long wavelength IR (LWIR) region (6 - 18 micron) are required in many space borne applications such as monitoring the global atmospheric temperature profiles, relative humidity profiles, cloud characteristics, {{and the distribution of}} minor constituents in the atmosphere which are being planned for future NASA Earth and planetary remote sensing systems. Due to higher radiation hardness, lower 1 /f noise, and larger array size the GaAs based Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) FPAs are very attractive for such space borne applications compared to intrinsic narrow band gap detector arrays. In this presentation we will discuss the optimization of the detector design, material growth and processing that has culminated in realization of large format long-wavelength QWIP FPAs, portable and <b>miniature</b> LWIR cameras, <b>holding</b> forth great promise for myriad applications in 6 - 18 micron wavelength range in science, medicine, defense and industry. In addition, we will present some system demonstrations using broadband, two-color, and high quantum efficiency long-wavelength QWIP FPAs...|$|R
40|$|The {{strongly}} racist {{character of}} the Democratic presidential campaign of 1868 is displayed full-blown in this elaborate attack on Reconstruction and Republican support of Negro rights. Horses with the heads of Democratic candidate Horatio Seymour and running mate Francis P. Blair, Jr., pull a fine, ornate carriage in a race with a rude wagon drawn by asses with the heads of Republican candidates Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax. The Democratic carriage pulls ahead in the race, heading toward a cheering crowd {{and a series of}} floral arches held by young maidens. The U. S. Capitol is visible beyond. In the carriage are four allegorical figures: Liberty, holding the Constitution and a banner which reads "Our Glorious Union D̀istinct, like the Billows, One, Like the Sea' This is a White Man's Government!"; Navigation, <b>holding</b> a <b>miniature</b> ship; Agriculture, <b>holding</b> sheaves of wheat and a scythe; and Labor, represented by a bearded man with a hammer and flywheel. In contrast to the Democratic vehicle, the Republican wagon has stalled before a pile of rocks and a cemetery strewn with bones representing " 100, 000, 000 White Lives, the Price of Nigger Freedom!" Its wheels are blocked by a large stone "Killing Taxation" and a skeleton. Other stones represent "Ruined Commerce," "$ 30, 000, 000 stolen from the Treasury," and "Negro Supremacy. " In the wagon are the grim reaper, Pennsylvania representative and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, an unidentified man, a black woman, and an idle black man. Stevens: "Colfax pulls like the d [...] l but old tangleleg [i. e., Grant] aint worth a d [...] n! Push at the tailboard, Ben!" Massachusetts representative and former Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler, pushing the wagon from the rear, replies, "I am pushing, Thad! but we are stuck. Seymour is a mile ahead now. " Silver spoons protrude from Butler's pocket. (For the origins of Butler's nickname "Silver Spoons," see "The Radical Party on a Heavy Grade," no. 1868 - 14.) The black woman reassures Stevens, "Don't worry you'sef, honey, or you'll peg out afore we get de paeket for Seymour's in de White House and we's good for Salt River [colloquialism for political disaster]. " The black man asks, "War's dis wagon gwine wid dis member ob Congress. I'd jes like to know?" The unidentified man remarks, "The Democracy would not take me so I thought I'd come back & stick by you Uncle Thad, and we'll all go to H-ll together!" Death announces, "My friends 1, 000, 000 slaughtered soldiers block the wheels [...] you fooled them, and they now impede your progress!" At bottom right a group of bummers, a term referring to party hangers-on, carpetbaggers, and other disreputable characters, stand in line to buy tickets to Salt River. At left New York "Tribune" editor Horace Greeley invites abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher to play the thimblerig. Nearby a black couple in rags express their desire to return to their former master. At top right, next to the U. S. Capitol, a group of black youths in striped outfits dance and tumble about.
