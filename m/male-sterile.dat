50|$|Because {{there is}} concern about pollen from genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops, <b>male-sterile</b> forms are being considered, particularly of maize. Male-fertile non-GM plants must then be grown with the GM crop to ensure pollination. In some cases, a xenia effect due to the genetic {{difference between the two}} strains has been observed that increases grain yield, and could make it financially viable to grow the <b>male-sterile</b> plants in such a mixture.|$|E
50|$|The {{biggest problem}} by then, was having no known method to {{reproduce}} hybrid rice in mass quantities, {{and that was}} what Yuan set out to solve. In 1964, Yuan created his theory of using the probably-existing naturally-mutated <b>male-sterile</b> rice individuals for the creation of reproductive hybrid rice species, and in two years he managed to find a few individuals of such <b>male-sterile</b> rice that he predicted could be used for his research. Subsequent experiments proved his theory feasible, which was his most important contribution on hybrid rice.|$|E

50|$|Claviceps africana infects sorghum. It only infects unfertilized ovaries, so {{self-pollination}} and fertilization can {{decrease the}} presence of the disease, but <b>male-sterile</b> lines are extremely vulnerable to infection. Symptoms of infection by C. africana include the secretion of honeydew (a fluid with high concentrates of sugar and conidia), which attracts insects like flies, beetles, and wasps that feed on it. This in turn contributes to the spread of the fungus to uninfected plants.|$|E
50|$|In crop breeding, {{although}} {{the use of}} heterosis in first-generation seeds (or F1) is well known, its application in rice was limited because of the self-pollination character of that crop. In 1974, Chinese scientists successfully transferred the male sterility gene from wild rice to create the cytoplasmic genetic <b>male-sterile</b> (CMS) line and hybrid combination. The first generation of hybrid rice varieties were three-line hybrids and produced yields thatwere about 15 to 20 percent greater than those of improved or high-yielding varieties of the same growth duration.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Blue Chip' grows {{moderately}} {{quickly to}} {{a height of}} 1.0 m, forming a dense, rounded structure including numerous lateral branches. The inflorescences are small terminal panicles 8 cm in length comprising < 200 flowers, violet-blue with an orange corolla throat. The mature leaves are elliptic, < 9.6 cm long by 3.6 cm wide, green above and grey-green below. The shrub is <b>male-sterile</b> and female fertility is low, reducing random seeding to a minimum. The cultivar is claimed 'to attract butterflies in abundance' in North America.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid {{production}} {{requires a}} female plant {{in which no}} viable male gametes are borne. Emasculation is done to prevent a plant from producing pollen so that it serves only as a female parent. Another simple way to establish a female line for hybrid seed production is to identify or create a line that is unable to produce viable pollen. Since this <b>male-sterile</b> line cannot self-pollinate, seed formation is dependent upon pollen from the male line. Cytoplasmic male sterility is used in hybrid seed production. In this case, the sterility is transmitted only through the female and all progeny will be sterile. This {{is not a problem}} for crops such as onions or carrots where the commodity harvested from the F1 generation is produced during vegetative growth. These CMS lines must be maintained by repeated crossing to a sister line (known as the maintainer line) that is genetically identical except that it possesses normal cytoplasm and is therefore male-fertile. In cytoplasmic - genetic male sterility restoration of fertility is done using restorer lines carrying nuclear genes. The <b>male-sterile</b> line is maintained by crossing with a maintainer line carrying the same nuclear genome as the MS line but with normal fertile cytoplasm.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{types of}} corn with normal {{cytoplasm}} (N), while vulnerable to Race O, have cytoplasmic {{resistance to the}} T-toxin of Bipolaris maydis (produced by Race T). This resistance owes itself {{to the absence of}} a gene found only in plants with Texas male sterile cytoplasm. [...] Corn plants with T-cms cytoplasm have maternally inherited the gene T-urf 13, which encodes for a protein component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This portion of the mitochondria functions as T-toxin's site of action. In a similar manner, Race C is only pathogenic to hosts with cytoplasm <b>male-sterile</b> C.|$|E
50|$|Silene conica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the pink family known by the common names striped corn catchfly and sand catchfly. It grows in dunes and sandy soils and is widespread in Europe and western Asia. It has an annual life history and produces self-compatible hermaphroditic flowers and occasional <b>male-sterile</b> flowers (i.e., gynomonoecy). Like other members of Silene section Conoimorpha, S. conica is readily recognizable based on its bright pink petals and the prominent, parallel veins on its calyx. In contrast to most flowering plants, S. conica {{appears to have a}} very rapid rate of mitochondrial mutation, and it is perhaps most notable for having the largest mitochondrial genome (11.3 Mb) ever identified.|$|E
50|$|Austroderia richardii usually flower around {{spring and}} early summer (September to November) though they always retain their plumes. It {{implements}} a stage of fruiting around the October and March months. All Austroderia species in New Zealand, including introduced ones, have been proven to be gynodioecious. Being gynodioecious means they are involved in a dimorphic breeding system in which <b>male-sterile</b> individuals coexist with hermaphroditic individuals in populations. Hermaphrodites may be self-compatible also (Connor H. E, 1973). Hermaphrodite Austroderia can be characterized by their large pollen filled anthers and small gynoecia (the female part of the flower). While female plants have flat, white or transparent, sterile anthers with larger gynoecia (Connor H. E, 1973). Both of these types of sex form seeds. Their seeds are wind dispersed.|$|E
50|$|But in 1970, the Southern corn leaf blight {{epidemic}} (Helminthosporium maydis Nisik. and Miyake) {{swept the}} U.S. corn belt. At the same time, at least 80% of the maize being {{grown in the}} U.S. was susceptible to the blight because this maize contained the “Texas type” <b>male-sterile</b> cytoplasm, which allowed production of hybrid seed without mechanical or hand detasseling. As a result, there was a scramble in 1971 to find any kind of maize that had normal cytoplasm - cytoplasm that would resist the blight. Consequently, some seed of waxy maize worked {{its way into the}} market. Through backcrossing, also has been used extensively to transfer individual genes such as wx (waxy), o2 (opaque 2) and the Htl gene for resistance to the leaf blight was transferred to regular dent corn.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to agricultural measures, {{there may be}} also biological tools to prevent the genetically modified crop from fertilising conventional fields. Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example <b>male-sterile</b> plants), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In {{an example of the}} latter, transplastomic plants can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of chloroplasts - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and Co-Extra. With the end of the de facto moratorium on genetically modified plants in Europe, several research programmes (e.g. SIGMEA, Co-Extra, and Transcontainer) have begun investigating biological containment strategies for GMOs.|$|E
50|$|The first {{documentation}} of male sterility was by Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter, who observed anther abortion within species and specific hybrids. Cytoplasmic male sterility {{has now been}} identified in over 150 plant species. It is more prevalent than female sterility, either because the male sporophyte and gametophyte are less protected from the environment than the ovule and embryo sac, or because it results from natural selection on mitochondrial genes which are maternally inherited and are thus not concerned with pollen production. Male sterility is easy to detect because {{a large number of}} pollen grains are produced and are easily studied. Male sterility is assayed through staining techniques (carmine, lactophenol or iodine), while detection of female sterility is by the absence of seeds. <b>Male-sterile</b> plants may be propagated, since they can still set seed, while female-sterile plants cannot. Male sterility can arise spontaneously via mutations in nuclear and/or cytoplasmic genes.|$|E
50|$|Silene was {{originally}} described by Linnaeus, {{and members of}} this genus {{have been the subject}} of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Carl Correns, Herbert G. Baker, and Janis Antonovics. Many Silene species continue to be widely used study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or <b>male-sterile)</b> individuals (gynodioecy), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility. Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes (dioecy) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris. Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus Silene hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified.|$|E
5000|$|Y1 was {{developed}} by tobacco plant researcher James Chapin, for Brown & Williamson (then a subsidiary of British American Tobacco) in the late 1970s, {{with the approval of}} the president at the time, Jimmie Carter. Chapin, a director of the USDA Research Laboratory at Oxford, North Carolina, had described the need for a higher nicotine tobacco plant in the trade publication World Tobacco in 1977, and had bred a number of high-nicotine strains based on a hybrid of Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana rustica, but they were weak and would blow over in a strong wind. B&W tested five strains on a farm in Wilson, North Carolina in 1983. Only two grew to maturity; Y2, which [...] "turned black in the drying barn and smelled like old socks," [...] and Y1, which was a success. B&W brought the plants to California company DNA Plant Technology for additional modification, including making the plants <b>male-sterile,</b> a procedure that prevents competitors from reproducing the strain from seeds. DNA Plant Technology then smuggled the seeds to a B&W subsidiary in Brazil. A 1991 industry document analyzing the potential of Y1 reported that it had been successfully grown in Brazil, Honduras and Zimbabwe but not Venezuela, and that it was both difficult to cure and susceptible to Granville wilt.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} mitochondrial genes on stamen development of higher plants, protoplasts from three different, <b>male-sterile</b> tobacco cultivars were fused. The fused cells were cultured individually into calli, from which plants were regenerated. Cybrid plants were obtained that exhibited flowers with recombined biparental <b>male-sterile</b> morphology and with novel <b>male-sterile</b> stamens that differed from any types from sexual or somatic hybridizations described previously. The <b>male-sterile</b> morphologies of these cybrids and their parents {{support the hypothesis that}} nuclear-mitochondrial interaction occurs at several stages in tobacco floral development and that several mitochondrial genes are necessary for normal stamen and corolla development. Analysis by restriction endonuclease digestion of mitochondrial DNA of <b>male-sterile</b> cybrids and their parents revealed that the mitochondrial DNA of <b>male-sterile</b> cybrids with parental floral morphology was unchanged when compared with parental mitochondrial DNA. Cybrids that were morphologically similar to one parent's <b>male-sterile</b> phenotype had mitochondrial DNA almost identical to that parent, whereas cybrids with recombined biparental or novel <b>male-sterile</b> phenotypes contained mitochondrial DNA different from both <b>male-sterile</b> parents and from each other.

40|$|Rice is a crop feeding {{half of the}} world’s population. With the {{continuous}} raise of yield potential via genetic improvement, rice breeding has entered an era where multiple genes conferring complex traits must be efficiently manipulated to increase rice yield further. Recurrent selection is a sound strategy for manipulating multiple genes {{and it has been}} successfully performed in allogamous crops. However, the difficulties in emasculation and hand pollination had obstructed efficient use of recurrent selection in autogamous rice. Here, we report development of the dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> rice that can facilitate recurrent selection in rice breeding. We adopted RNAi technology to synergistically regulate rice plant height and male fertility to create the dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> rice. The RNAi construct pTCK-EGGE, targeting the OsGA 20 ox 2 and OsEAT 1 genes, was constructed and used to transform rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic T 0 plants showing largely reduced plant height and complete <b>male-sterile</b> phenotypes were designated as the dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> plants. Progenies of the dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> plants were obtained by pollinating them with pollens from the wild-type. In the T 1 and T 2 populations, half of the plants were still dwarf male-sterile; the other half displayed normal plant height and male fertility which were designated as tall and male-fertile plants. The tall and male-fertile plants are transgene-free and can be self-pollinated to generate new varieties. Since emasculation and hand pollination for dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> rice plants is no longer needed, the dwarf <b>male-sterile</b> rice can be used to perform recurrent selection in rice.
