30|$|In {{the history}} of the Moon exploration, one of the most amazing discoveries was the {{concentrated}} areas of mass found on the near side of the moon (Muller and Sjogren 1968; Melosh et al. 2013; Freed et al. 2014). These concentrated areas of mass, referred to as <b>mascons,</b> usually have a positive gravity anomaly peak and surrounded by negative gravity anomalies with low geographical elevation. The knowledge of the interior density structure of <b>mascons</b> will help to understand its origin mechanism (Wang et al. 2015; Jansen et al. 2017). There has a significant improvement on lunar gravity field model development (Matsumoto et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2012), and the recent high solution gravity field model GL 1500 E derived from GRAIL mission (The Planetary Data System 2016) makes it possible to investigate the interior density structure of the <b>mascons</b> (Zuber et al. 2013 a, b) using lunar gradient data.|$|R

5|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are <b>mascons,</b> large positive gravitational anomalies associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some <b>mascons</b> exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its <b>mascons,</b> the Moon {{has only}} four [...] "frozen orbit" [...] {{inclination}} zones where a lunar satellite {{can stay in}} a low orbit indefinitely. Lunar subsatellites were released on the last three Apollo manned lunar landing missions in 1971 and 1972; the subsatellite PFS-2 released from Apollo 16 was expected to stay in orbit for {{one and a half}} years, but lasted only 35 days before crashing into the lunar surface. It was only in 2001 that the <b>mascons</b> were mapped and the frozen orbits were discovered.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mascons</b> are in {{part due}} to the {{presence}} of dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill some of the impact basins. However, lava flows by themselves cannot fully explain the gravitational variations, and uplift of the crust-mantle interface is required as well. Based on Lunar Prospector gravitational models, {{it has been suggested that}} some <b>mascons</b> exist that do not show evidence for mare basaltic volcanism. The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with Oceanus Procellarum does not cause a positive gravity anomaly. The center of gravity of the Moon does not coincide exactly with its geometric center, but is displaced toward the Earth by about 2 kilometers.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} a giant impact on the thermal {{evolution}} of the moon are investigated. It is found that an impact {{similar to that of}} Imbrium creates lateral temperature variations of more than 200 deg within the upper 200 km of the moon. Starting with a common lithosphere of 70 km thickness, the lithosphere beneath the basin grows to 200 km in thickness within 0. 5 b. y. after the impact, while that beneath the highlands reaches to only 100 km in thickness during this period. The model presented for the thermal evolution of the moon is compatible with (1) the existence of <b>mascons</b> for more than 3 b. y., (2) the late magmatization and subsequent volcanic activities during 4 to 3 b. y. ago, and (3) the negative gravity rings around the large <b>mascons...</b>|$|R
50|$|While not {{a direct}} cause of orbital decay, uneven mass {{distributions}} (known as <b>mascons)</b> {{of the body}} being orbited can perturb orbits over time, and extreme distributions can cause orbits to be highly unstable.

50|$|Typical {{examples}} of <b>mascon</b> basins on the Moon are the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium and Orientale impact basins, {{all of which}} exhibit significant topographic depressions and positive gravitational anomalies. Examples of <b>mascon</b> basins on Mars include the Argyre, Isidis, and Utopia basins. Theoretical considerations imply that a topographic low in isostatic equilibrium would exhibit a slight negative gravitational anomaly. Thus, the positive gravitational anomalies associated with these impact basins indicate {{that some form of}} positive density anomaly must exist within the crust or upper mantle that is currently supported by the lithosphere. One possibility is that these anomalies are due to dense mare basaltic lavas, which might reach up to 6 kilometers in thickness for the Moon. While these lavas certainly contribute to the observed gravitational anomalies, uplift of the crust-mantle interface is also required to account for their magnitude. Indeed, some <b>mascon</b> basins on the Moon {{do not appear to be}} associated with any signs of volcanic activity. Theoretical considerations in either case indicate that all the lunar mascons are super-isostatic (that is, supported above their isostatic positions). The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with Oceanus Procellarum does not possess a positive gravitational anomaly.|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the concept of {{hydrostatic}} head, the height to which a fluid at a given pressure will rise in a gravitational field, can be usefully applied to magmatic liquids and to a number of problems in volcanology.

In the reported investigation, simple hydrostatic concepts are extended to synthesize results from experimental petrology, lunar chronology, thermal history models, seismology, and gravity. Attention is given to a scenario for early lunar history, the density of lunar rocks and basaltic liquids, the thickness of the lunar crust, the source depth of mare basalt versus time, hydrostatic considerations with respect to the occurrence of high-titanium and low-titanium mare basalts, the structure of <b>mascons,</b> and the extension of the concepts of hydrostatics to the parent liquids of other basaltic rocks returned from the lunar surface...|$|R
40|$|Lunar spherical {{harmonic}} gravity coefficients {{are estimated}} from simulated observations of a near-circular low altitude polar orbiter disturbed by lunar <b>mascons.</b> Lunar gravity sensing missions using earth-based nearside observations {{with and without}} satellite-based far-side observations are simulated and least squares maximum likelihood estimates are developed for spherical harmonic expansion fit models.

Two different lunar spacecraft mission phases are simulated to evaluate the estimated fit models. Results for predicting state covariances one orbit ahead are presented along with the state errors resulting from the mismodeled gravity field. The position errors from planning a lunar landing maneuver with a mismodeled gravity field are also presented. These simulations clearly demonstrate the need to include observations of satellite motion over the far side in estimating the lunar gravity field.
