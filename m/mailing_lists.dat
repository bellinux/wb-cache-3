5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E

50|$|For a time, the cypherpunks <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> was {{a popular}} tool with mailbombers, who would {{subscribe}} a victim to the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> in order to cause a deluge of messages {{to be sent to}} him or her. (This was usually done as a prank, in contrast to the style of terrorist referred to as a mailbomber.) This precipitated the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> sysop(s) to institute a reply-to-subscribe system. Approximately two hundred messages a day was typical for the <b>mailing</b> <b>list,</b> divided between personal arguments and attacks, political discussion, technical discussion, and early spam.|$|R
50|$|There was {{controversy}} over the copying of the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> data from the old server to create the new <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> of Google Groups. This was raised {{as a violation of}} the UK Data Protection Act by Luke Leighton. Whether this was actually a legal violation is not really clear and is open to interpretation. This was a community driven open source project. According to many in the community, both Luke and Anthony were co-administrators of the project and co-leads to it. It was being forked by a team including Anthony, one of the administrators who had privileges for the server, which Luke Leighton owned. The <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> was part of the domain. So the ownership of the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> data itself isn't very clear. Though Luke claims he personally owned the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> and that using it to create a new <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> for the new pyjs.org fork of the project constituted stealing, many in the community feel differently. Many feel that this was an open source community project and Luke Leighton was a co-lead and co-administrator. Hence the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> was actually a community property of the pyjs.org community and not the personal property of Luke.|$|R
