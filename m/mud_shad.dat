50|$|Both {{birds and}} dinosaurs use gizzard stones. These stones are {{swallowed}} by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once {{they enter the}} stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.Gizzard stones are also found in some fish (mullets, <b>mud</b> <b>shad,</b> and the gillaroo, a type of trout) and in crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|The mullet (Mugilidae) {{found in}} estuarine waters worldwide, and the gizzard or <b>mud</b> <b>shad,</b> found in {{freshwater}} lakes and streams from New York to Mexico, have gizzards.The gillaroo (Salmo stomachius), a richly colored species of trout found in Lough Melvin, a {{lake in the}} north of Ireland, has a gizzard which is used to aid the digestion of water snails, the main component of its diet.|$|E

50|$|Betty Boop {{is putting}} her nephew, Junior, to bed, {{but he is}} not ready to sleep. He jumps on the bed, then uses a tube of {{toothpaste}} to put stripes on the cat. When Betty catches him, she tells him a fairy tale about a naughty boy. The boy in the story ties a can on a tail of a puppy resembling Pudgy the Puppy, scares a hen and prematurely frees her chick, shakes apples off a tree and cuts it down, throws bricks at a greenhouse, knocks clean laundry into the <b>mud,</b> and <b>shaves</b> the hair off a barber. When he teases a lion at a nearby circus by taking its bone out of its cage, the lion escapes its cage and the boy has to be rescued by a magic fairy (Betty Boop with fairy wings, wearing a star-covered black evening dress). The fairy rescues the little boy but makes him promise to undo all his mischief. This is done rather easily by the animators reversing the sequence of scenes from {{the first part of the}} story. Junior is not certain that he believes the story, but at last he is ready to go to sleep and undoes his mischief with the same reversal of sequences, and hides under the covers in fear, likely because of the lion.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} simple; that is easily explicable. I am not his doll--his baby--his infatuation: his nature is. The judge and his late wife {{never had any}} children. The judge {{and his wife were}} past middle age when this {{treasure}} fell into their lap. One must make allowances for a parental instinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years. It is famished, it is crazed with hunger by that time, and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy; its taste is atrophied, it can't tell <b>mud</b> cat from <b>shad.</b> A devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them, and remains so, through thick and thin. Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated with him. Tom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all things; I don't mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of things: the things that create or abolish personal partialities or prejudices in the old man's mind. The old man liked both of you. Tom conceived a hatred for you. That was enough; it turned the old man around at once. The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these late-adopted darlings throws a brick at it." ...|$|R
