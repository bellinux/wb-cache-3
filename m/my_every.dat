[...] He also attributes his mother's idols – Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles – to shaping his musical style, calling them [...] "a huge part of my upbringing". Levine attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates.

2500|$|Audubon {{lived with}} the tenants in the two-story stone house, {{in an area that}} he {{considered}} a paradise.

[...] Studying his surroundings, Audubon quickly learned the ornithologist's rule, which he wrote down as, [...] "The nature of the place—whether high or low, moist or dry, whether sloping north or south, or bearing tall trees or low shrubs—generally gives hint as to its inhabitants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1872 and 1885, the King had 209 private {{performances}} (Separatvorstellungen) {{given for}} himself {{alone or with}} a guest, in the two court theaters, comprising 44 operas (28 by Wagner, including eight of Parsifal), 11 ballets, and 154 plays (the principal theme being Bourbon France) {{at a cost of}} 97,300 marks. This was not due so much to misanthropy but, as the King complained to the theatre actor-manager Ernst Possart: [...] "I can get no sense of illusion in the theatre so long as people keep staring at me, and follow <b>my</b> <b>every</b> expression through their opera-glasses. I want to look myself, not to be a spectacle for the masses." ...|$|E
