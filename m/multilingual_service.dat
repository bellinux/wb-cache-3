AboutEuDML. — EuDML, theEuropean DigitalMathematicsLibrary(www. eudml. eu), is a project that will build a new <b>multilingual</b> <b>service</b> for searching and browsing the con-tent of existing European mathematical portals [5, 1]. It will be based on a rich metadata repository, aggregating metadata and full text of heterogeneous and multilingual collec-tions of digitised and born digital content (articles, books, theses, etc.). The service will merge and augment the information about each document from each collection, and also will match documents and references across the entire combined library. Entities such as authors, bibliographic references and mathematical concepts will be singled out and linked to matching items in the collections; similar mechanisms will be provided as public web-services so that end-users or other external services will be able to discover and link to EuDML items. This way, EuDML will be a new major international player in the emerging landscape of scientific information discovery services, enabled for reuse in new added value chains.

Our {{proposed}} “Language Grid ” infrastructure supports multilingual communication {{by combining}} in new way language resources, such as machine translators, morphological analyzers, and dictionaries specific to user communities. We developed the Language Grid {{as a language}} infrastructure on the Internet.

Because the quality of language services is not often defined, however, we need {{to confirm that the}} created <b>multilingual</b> <b>service</b> is really useful. We need to extend the process of general usability testing to the multilingual environment. For example, cooperation between user communities and language grid providers can significantly improve the accuracy of machine translation: it turns out that machine translations can be useful for interactive communication in the field of inter-cultural collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Given the {{importance}} of customer loyalty in services, the article addresses how customer loyalty {{is influenced by the}} language the service provider uses. Despite {{the importance}} of the interaction in service encounters, service research assumes that both customers and service providers share a common native language. This might not be the case on bilingual markets. Specifically, the paper tests whether bilinguals who are served in their second language are less likely to return to the service provider. Moreover, it examines the mediating role of perceived speech accommodation efforts, and the moderating roles of bilinguals’ perceived second language proficiency and emotional attachment to the native language. Design/method/approach Study 1 and 2 tests the main hypothesis using a scenario-based experiment with adult consumers in two bilingual countries (Belgium, Finland) and in different settings (restaurant, telecom). Study 3 further elaborates on these findings using a retrospective survey of actual customer experiences in Belgium. Findings Driven by perceptions of speech accommodation efforts and consistent throughout different services, countries and methods, customer return intentions sharply decrease when service providers in bilingual markets do no use the customer’s language. Moreover, this relationship is not dependent on consumers’ perceived second language proficiency, but rather upon their emotional attachment to their native language. Originality/value This is the first study of bilingual customers’ reactions to being served in their second language, among bilingual customers from different countries. Given that more than half the countries in the world are <b>multilingual,</b> <b>service</b> providers need to take customers’ native language into account when serving bilingual customers. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master’s {{thesis is}} to examine the virtual {{reference}} service Ask the Library [Bibblan svarar] from a postmodern perspective. Ask the Library is a Swedish online reference service that is run by the country’s public libraries. The postmodern theories of Jean-François Lyotard are used to study how information is managed and transmitted within the service. From this point-of-view three aspects of the reference service are studied; how the information is affected by the virtual environment, the librarian’s role within the service and finally how the content of the service is managed. The methods for extracting data are a blend of qualitative interviews and online observations. The data is then analyzed from a theoretical viewpoint. The result shows that there are several postmodern tendencies in Ask the Library. Namely the service shows a number of indications toward plurality. This can be related to Lyotard’s theory of the downfall of the grand narratives since postmodern theories celebrate the idea of plurality and diversity. Ask the Library is complex and dynamic {{in the sense that it}} adapts its services to the users. In addition to a <b>multilingual</b> <b>service,</b> Ask the Library also offers the users reference help in the form of social network sites like Facebook and Twitter. This makes the service more varied but also deeply complex. The reference service also emphasizes on the librarian’s individual competence and promotes personal knowledge and expertise. In Lyotard’s postmodern theories there is a rejection of absolute and objective truths and this falls in line with the subjectivity that the reference service celebrates. Ask the Library has two different agendas; providing qualitative reference service to the users and also promoting the librarians and their skills. The information, or content, in the service is still organized and under examination by the librarians. Critique of the sources is an important skill for a librarian within Ask the Library to have. These traditional ideas of objective truth are balanced with the new virtual environment that often promotes collective construction of information and knowledge. This study is a two years master’s thesis in the academic field library and information science...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{translation}} programs within a university context has multiplied {{in many countries}} worldwide, {{which led to the}} need to question their quality (Gambier, 2012). In the Arab world, especially in the Gulf region, translator education is an emerging practice. For instance, in Qatar, the first translation programs were launched in 2012 at both Qatar University (BA minor in translation) and the MA programs in translation studies at the Translation and Interpreting Institute (College of Humanities and Social Sciences; Hammad bin Khalifa University). Arabic scholars in the field of translation have highlighted the ongoing curriculum and pedagogical issues at the regional level. Many university programs in the Gulf region prefer to import foreign curriculum packages rather than invest in creating localized programs (Badry & Willoughly, 2015); hence, {{there is a need for}} programs relevant to the local and regional communities and contexts (Taibi, 2016). This could only be done through ground exploratory research to identify the problems and address them through a consensus process between the various stakeholders: academia, society and the profession. This doctoral thesis is a result of an exploratory and descriptive study carried out on the two existing translation programs in Qatar (a postgraduate program at the translation and interpreting Institute at Hammad Bin Khalifa University; and an undergraduate program at Qatar University) to identify the type of pedagogical and curricular practices in these institutions and align them with the findings from the practices in the translation and interpreting professions as well as translation professionals' perceptions in the state of Qatar. The present study has focused on the following objectives: 1) the identification and description of the professional translator profile in the Qatari context; 2) the identification of the pedagogical (teaching and learning) practices used in translation programs at Arabic universities in the Gulf region, such as Qatar; 3) knowledge required according to the opinions of professionals working in the field, and the competencies that these professionals believe should be developed in a translation program; and 4) a description of the necessary conditions to integrate such professional requirements in these types of professionally-oriented programs. The findings obtained from the study suggest that a knowledge of the working environments of translators and the required knowledge, skills and abilities to exercise the translation profession is crucial to a translation instructor as well as to a translation or interpreting curriculum developer. Such an awareness would result in the transfer of a different meaning of translation and translator status in society than the one it carries at present in Qatar. Also, there is a need to update the pedagogical and curriculum practices within a university context in Qatar to further integrate professionally oriented types of content, and adopt innovative pedagogies to educate <b>multilingual</b> <b>service</b> providers in the country. Although participants claimed that they are willing to integrate dynamic teaching practices, at the same time they also declared that they would keep the same curricular practices privileged by the institutions. The Interviewees from the profession reported the poor students’ performance in an internship in the local context. Other interviewed practising translators - who graduated from one of the translation programs in Qatar- suggested that the current modes of instruction need to be revised and that more situated, project and problem-based types of activities need to be implemented in the classroom. The results may be useful for teaching staff, instructors, administrators, and the management to improve and reconsider their existing curriculum and pedagogical practices within a university-based program by including the integration of research-based professional practices in the initial design of courses. The positive and consensus-based partnership between academic instances and the professional practitioners is a key solution in this regard. The addition or deletion of courses in a program and the focus on the importance of textbooks without diagnosing the social and community needs, as well the lack of a clear framework to assess faculty or instructor competency and eligibility to educate and train translators, has led to quality issues in existing programs...|$|E
