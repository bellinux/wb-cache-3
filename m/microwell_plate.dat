40|$|Diagnostic tool {{comprises}} one of {{the vital}} components in the control of infectious diseases. One {{of the most common}} techniques in the diagnosis of infectious disease currently available is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because this technique is very sensitive, specific, and rapid. This technique requires an adjunct technique to indicate the formation of the right reaction product. Agarose gel electrophoresis has been the most common technique to visualise the PCR product or amplicon. Enzyme linked oligonucleotide sorbent assay (ELOSA) is an alternative technique which is more sensitive and gives more important identity of the amplicon. This technique can be more than 100 times as sensitive as a gel agarose electrophoresis, and very specific since confirmation of the amplicon is carried out by DNA hibridisation. The capacity of the ELOSA can also be extended to the detection of disease-causal agent at subtype level, or detection of mutation at particular location in a gene. Since the equipment used for ELOSA is similar to that for ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), a large number of samples can be accomplished rapidly. As in ELISA, a number of variation can be made in ELOSA depend on the requirement.

Empirical approaches to characterise these currently use cumbersome experimental systems; hence {{the need to develop}} a high throughput research tool, analogous to the techniques used in high throughput pharmaceutical research. In this study, a microwell research tool was evaluated as a growth and measurement tool for mixed autotrophic bioleaching cultures. The tool was assessed by comparing its performance to conventional shake flask apparatus. Mixed mesophilic cultures of predominantly Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were used. Growth and ferrous iron oxidation kinetics were quantified and assessed.

40|$|A {{membrane}} chemiluminescent assay {{was developed}} for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus. This one step liquid phase immuno-recognition procedure was achieved by incubating samples containing S. aureus cells with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled monoclonal antibody, followed by recovery of the cells on a membrane, and measurement of the HRP catalyzed chemiluminescent signal on the membrane surface with a luminometer. Optimum pH, antibody binding temperature and time, and sensitivity of the assay were determined. The optimum pH for the chemiluminescent reaction was at 8. 5. No {{significant difference was found}} between ambient temperature (22 °C– 25 °C) and 37 °C incubation. Binding time of 60 min had a higher signal than 10 or 20 min. Chemiluminescent signal due to non-specific binding was tested with various membrane materials, and Durapore® polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) had the lowest background signal. Different chemiluminescent reagents were studied to achieve the highest sensitivity combined with a low reagent background. SuperSignal® LBA produced a significantly higher signal output than Luminol/Enhencer and LumiGLOTM reagents. Two different diameter membranes, 25 mm and 13 mm, were first tested in a luminometer tube format assay. A hand-operated syringe filtration unit was used to capture cells and the membrane was then transferred to a luminometer tube for the chemiluminescent reaction. The sensitivity of the immunoassay was approximately 104 CFU/ml of S. aureus. Efforts had been made to refine the immunoassay into a simple, sensitive and rapid chemiluminescent fiber optic biosensor. An improved system utilized a simple but efficient <b>microwell</b> <b>plate</b> vacuum filtration unit with an 8 mm membrane sealed {{at the bottom of the}} sample well. The sample was concentrated on the membrane and positioned directly in front of a fiber optic light guide to effectively collect and transmit the signal to the luminometer. Labeling S. aureus in solution proved to be much more effective than on the membrane surface. Using the <b>microwell</b> <b>plate</b> filtration system resulted in less sample handling, better reproducibility, and dramatically reduced assay time. The average variability for 25 mm and 13 mm assays were 24. 7 % and 13. 3 %, while the <b>microwell</b> <b>plate</b> assay reduced this to only 4. 0 %. The ability of the fiber optic probe to effectively collect the signal meant the sensitivity of the assay was not compromised with smaller membrane and sample size. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 3. 8 × 104 CFU/ml, adequate to detect the organism at concentrations lower than the level that could result in food poisoning. The biosensor demonstrated specificity to S. aureus cells in the presence of sample food materials as well as in buffer. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Here we {{describe}} a novel cultivation method, called EnBase™, or enzyme-based-substrate-delivery, {{for the growth}} of microorganisms in millilitre and sub-millilitre scale which yields 5 to 20 times higher cell densities compared to standard methods. The novel method can be directly applied in <b>microwell</b> <b>plates</b> and shake flasks without any requirements for additional sensors or liquid supply systems. EnBase is therefore readily applicable for many high throughput applications, such as DNA production for genome sequencing, optimisation of protein expression, production of proteins for structural genomics, bioprocess development, and screening of enzyme and metagenomic libraries. Results High cell densities with EnBase are obtained by applying the concept of glucose-limited fed-batch cultivation which is commonly used in industrial processes. The major difference of the novel method is that no external glucose feed is required, but glucose is released into the growth medium by enzymatic degradation of starch. To cope with the high levels of starch necessary for high cell density cultivation, starch is supplied to the growing culture suspension by continuous diffusion from a storage gel. Our results show that the controlled enzyme-based supply of glucose allows a glucose-limited growth to high cell densities of OD 600 = 20 to 30 (corresponding to 6 to 9 g l - 1 cell dry weight) without the external feed of additional compounds in shake flasks and 96 -well plates. The final cell density can be further increased by addition of extra nitrogen during the cultivation. Production of a heterologous triosphosphate isomerase in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) resulted in 10 times higher volumetric product yield and a higher ratio of soluble to insoluble product when compared to the conventional production method. Conclusion The novel EnBase method is robust and simple-to-apply for high cell density cultivation in shake flasks and <b>microwell</b> <b>plates.</b> The potential of the system is that the microbial growth rate and oxygen consumption can be simply controlled by the amount (and principally also by the activity) of the starch-degrading enzyme. This solves the problems of uncontrolled growth, oxygen limitation, and severe pH drop in shaken cultures. In parallel the method provides the basis for enhanced cell densities. The feasibility of the new method has been shown for 96 -well plates and shake flasks and we believe that it can easily be adapted to different <b>microwell</b> and deepwell <b>plate</b> formats and shake flasks. Therefore EnBase will be a helpful tool especially in high throughput applications. </p...|$|R

Using microfluidics of droplet technologies, hundreds to thousands of cells can be sequenced in a single run [41, 42]. Due to massive and parallel processing, capture sites may be empty or contain either single or multiple cells. Furthermore, captured cells may be healthy, stressed, broken, or even damaged due to handling. Low quality sites and cells need to be excluded from the experiment since their data may be misleading. Several approaches have been proposed for filtering low quality sites and cells [29, 35, 43 – 46]. They may be classified into microscopic imaging of individual cells and staining cells with viability dyes.|$|R
30|$|For the {{determination}} of the factional inhibitory concentration (FIC), the microdilution “checkerboard” method was applied in microwell-containing plates. In this method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined, for both antibiotics and Ag-NPs alone and in their paired combinations (Isenberg 2007). For antibiotics and Ag-NPs, the test range was 0.5 – 128  μg/mL. The sterility of prepared <b>microwell</b> <b>plates</b> was checked by incubation it in 37  °C for 24  h. Bacterial inoculum was prepared from an 18 – 24  h incubation of the test organism grown on Muller-Hinton broth (MHB). The organisms were harvested, and suspended in sterile MHB to produce a McFarland, 0.5 (turbidity equivalent to 108 colony forming units). The 0.5 McFarlands suspension was diluted in fresh MHB to achieve final CFU of 4 × 106 to 5 × 106 from which 0.01  mL was inoculated into the microwells. The bacterial inoculated microtitre plates were incubated at 37  °C for 16 – 20  h.|$|R
