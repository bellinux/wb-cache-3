[...] He noted the improved mechanics for goalies and stick battles between other players. He enjoyed the EASHL and Franchise Mode, saying that [...] "NHL has needed this sort of <b>management</b> <b>mode</b> badly for a while now."

40|$|Abstract. A recent {{trend in}} {{international}} management {{research has been}} the development of contingency models that identify optimal planning and <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> for international business units, given key characteristics of the product, market, and industry. In practice, however, planning and <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> appear to be dictated not only by external market and industry conditions, but also by internal aspects of the firm's administrative orientation. The intent {{of this paper is}} to examine how aspects of the firm's administrative orientation influence the choice of <b>management</b> <b>modes,</b> and to examine how the choice of <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> impacts international performance. * A primary focus of current international management research rests on the development of contingency models for defining international management activi-ties. Frameworks developed by Lorange and Vancil [1975, 1977], Prahalad and Doz [1980], and Davidson and Haspeslagh [1982], for example, attempt to identify the optimal location and focus of management responsibilities for a business unit, given factors such as competitive conditions, cost structure, market characteristics, technological content, standardization potential, and lif...|$|R

The <b>management</b> <b>mode</b> {{takes place in a}} single city, called Mega Primus, rather than being spread out over the entire planet Earth as in the previous games. In addition, Apocalypse was the first game in the X-COM series to include a real-time combat option as well as the traditional turn-based mode.|$|E

30|$|The studies {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which external factors influence the achievement of objectives, but did not enquire the influence of the external factors on informal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes.</b> The studies therefore concentrated only on the effect of formal strategic management and did not explore the informal strategic management practices, neither did the studies explore how the factors moderated the types of informal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> being employed by small enterprises which this study investigated.|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{strategic}} management is viewed differently by scholars of small enterprises. Indeed, an increasing amount {{has been written}} on strategic management for small enterprises (SEs), {{and a number of}} <b>modes</b> of strategic <b>management</b> have been proposed. Each of these modes, however, is unique in terms of its composition, logic, and emphasis, {{and there seems to be}} no consensus on how strategic management should be conducted or on whether a given plan is suitable for every small business (Hill and Gareth 2012 a). Two contentious modes prevail: the formal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> and the informal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unreal mode {{is still}} {{extensively}} used by BIOS code. In particular, the System <b>Management</b> <b>Mode</b> (SMM) in Intel 386SL and later processors places the processor in unreal mode.|$|E
50|$|Initially, System <b>Management</b> <b>Mode</b> {{was used}} for {{implementing}} Advanced Power Management (APM) features. However, over time, some BIOS manufacturers have relied on SMM for other functionality like making a USB keyboard work in real mode.|$|E
50|$|While most media {{coverage}} of the game has concentrated on its advocacy aspect rather than its gameplay, one review has commented that it is initially unclear in the <b>management</b> <b>mode</b> how to go about growing food and other tasks.|$|E
30|$|Formal {{strategic}} <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> {{conform to}} {{the conventional wisdom that}} the strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> that managers use, the patterns in actions they develop, the positions and postures they establish, and therefore the performance levels they achieve must all flow from prescribed models (Menzel and Günther 2012; Ansoff 1965; Hofer and Schendel 1978; Porter 1985, and more recently, Pearce and Robinson 2011). Some schools of thought, however, have viewed strategic management as an informal, unstructured, and instinctive decision-making course that does not bear the rational analytical systems of the classical approaches espoused to the small enterprises by classical theorists (Carson 1990; Minzberg 1978, 2001; Quinn 1980; Verreynne 2006).|$|R
30|$|Abandoning the {{decentralized}} <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> at {{the client}} of end-to-end QoE evaluation system, QoE co-evaluation method based on fuzzy clustering algorithm adopts centralized <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> {{to unify the}} service evaluation management process of the server side. With this method, the server side collects media parameters and user information of client feedback information in the evaluation process. According to the network status, “big data” processing method is utilized for the evaluation model to do fuzzy clustering analysis. Finally, service QoE evaluation score is predicted in accord with heuristic rule, and management information is feedback to the client to guide media transmission path selection and payload distribution, so as to complete QoE co-evaluation.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{indicate}} that 75 % of small enterprises {{in the world}} fail during their first 5 years of operation. In Kenya, just about 20 % grow to the next size category. Scholars have prescribed formal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes,</b> but the small enterprises (SEs) continue to not only fail but also depict informal strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes.</b> However, {{few studies have been}} done to examine whether the dismal performance of SEs is due to other factors unrelated to the management of the enterprises, especially {{in the context of a}} developing country like Kenya. The specific objectives were to identify the strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> employed by the small enterprises in Kisumu County with specific reference to the Youth Enterprise Fund beneficiaries in Kisumu County and to assess the factors influencing the choice of these modes. The study was anchored on Mintzbergs' theories on deliberate, emergent, and reactive strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes.</b> The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional research design. The target population was the 242 small enterprises run by the Youth Enterprise Development Fund (YEDF), out of which 134 enterprises were sampled using Yamane's criteria. The study adopted questionnaire and interview methods as the basic data collection methods with the questionnaire being tested through content validity index and Cronbach alpha's internal consistency index, respectively. The study found that the basic modes used by small enterprise were deliberate, emergent, and reactive and that the small enterprises in Kisumu County used these modes interchangeably but relied more on the reactive <b>mode</b> of strategic <b>management.</b> The study revealed that the choice of these modes was dictated by the personal, environmental, and firm characteristics of the enterprises. The study concludes that continued exposure to formal modes would only sustain the endemic failure of the SEs because the SEs need formal exposure to models that address their situation. The study therefore urgently recommends formalization of elements of reactive strategic <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> and the personal factors in small firm curricula.|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} inventory-distribution routing problem for two-echelon {{agriculture}} products distribution network are established, {{which are based}} on two <b>management</b> <b>modes,</b> franchise chain and regular chain, one-to-many, interval periodic order, demand depending on inventory, deteriorating treatment cost of agriculture products, start-up costs of vehicles and so forth. Then, a heuristic adaptive genetic algorithm is presented for the model of franchise chain. For the regular chain model, a two-layer genetic algorithm based on oddment modification is proposed, in which the upper layer is to determine the distribution period and quantity and the lower layer is to seek the optimal order cycle, quantity, distribution routes, and the rational oddment modification number for the distributor. By simulation experiments, the validity of the algorithms is demonstrated, and the two <b>management</b> <b>modes</b> are compared...|$|R
