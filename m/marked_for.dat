5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Howe {{spent four}} years as {{flagship}} of the Training Squadron at Portland, before she was placed in reserve in 1950. The battleship was <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> disposal in 1957, sold for scrap in 1958, and completely broken up by 1961.|$|E

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E

5|$|McNicoll relinquished {{command of}} HMAS Australia in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> {{disposal}} the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office. In November, he embarked for London {{to attend the}} Imperial Defence College {{as part of the}} 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> senior command. McNicoll and his wife, Ruth, had separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London. On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead register office. Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London. He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defence; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.|$|E

5|$|Verbs are <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> {{grammatical}} {{information in}} three distinct sets of inflectional paradigms, called Verb orders. Each order corresponds generally {{to one of}} three main sentence types: the Independent order is used in main clauses, the Conjunct order in subordinate clauses, and the Imperative order in commands.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in {{that they can be}} followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E
50|$|As per the marking scheme, each {{question}} carries 3 marks {{and there is}} negative marking of 1 <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> each wrong answer. There is no negative <b>marking</b> <b>for</b> the non-multiple choice questions.|$|R

[...] A taste panel of thirteen individuals gave it high <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> firmness, average <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> flavor, and lower <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> flakiness compared with other species sampled. It was judged to be most similar to the short bigeye and the (much larger) red drum.|$|R

5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E
5|$|It {{was built}} by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 {{at a cost of}} 1 million rupees, and was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan. The mosque was {{completed}} in 1656 AD with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 persons. There are three domes on the terrace which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total of 899 black borders are <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> worshippers. The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore, Pakistan, is similar to the Jama Masjid, Delhi.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though most}} of the nations {{exporting}} electronic equipment into the US market have their own standards for EMI as well as independent certification and conformity marks (e.g.: The CCC certification <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> China, the VCCI (Voluntary Council for Control of Interference) <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> Japan, the KCC mark by the Korea Communications Commission for South Korea, the ANATEL <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> Brazil, and the BSMI <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> Taiwan), most of the products still sold in these markets hold the FCC label. Electronic products sold in parts of Asia and Africa hold the FCC label even though it holds no legal significance, and also without any means to verify whether they actually conform to the specified standards or not.|$|R

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973. At {{the start of}} the year, Sydney was <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E
