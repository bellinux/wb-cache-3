40|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>meadow</b> <b>lizard,</b> Darevskia pontica, in Romania is still inadequately documented. In the light of new distribution data reported here and gleaned from the literature, the species is more widely distributed in the country. The distribution seems to be continuous in southern Romania, even if fragmented and associated with extant woodland patches. The present distribution pattern could {{be the result of}} extensive deforestation process in the area, which isolated this forest lizard to remnant patches, as already indicated in the literature...|$|E
