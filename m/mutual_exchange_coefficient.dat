40|$|To {{examine the}} impact of air-sea <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> on the {{structure}} and intensity of tropical cyclones, sensitivity experiments are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. A typhoon-like idealized vortex embedded in a calm environment is simulated using combinations of three different values of air-sea momentum and enthalpy <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients.</b> In order to investigate the clear roles of each <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the experiments are designed that the two <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> change independently. For example, while the enthalpy <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> varies, the momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> keeps its original value and vice versa. The track and intensity of sensitivity tests are analyzed to check the validity of the experiments. Results show that the track of the idealized vortices under a calm environment remains stationary, while the intensity varies with different air-sea <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The results indicate that changes in storm intensity with different enthalpy <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> are mainly related to an alteration in the amount of energy input to the storm, whereas the intensity changes with different momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> values mostly result from angular momentum conservation due to changes {{in the size of the}} vortex. There is little change in the net energy input to the storms when the values of the momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> are changed. Calculations of the volume-integrated angular momentum at the radius of the maximum winds confirm the different intensifying mechanisms found in this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} the {{effective}} <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> for area-averaged fluxes can depend significantly on the averaging scale. This dependence implies that the <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> in numerical models should depend on grid size. The main goal {{of this study is}} the assessment of the importance of such scale-dependence. When the large-scale flow is weak, the mesoscale motions on scales smaller than the averaging width (grid size) may generate significant turbulence which is not represented by the area-averaged wind vector (resolved flow). In this case, the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> must be larger than that predicted by similarity theory in order to predict the grid-averaged turbulent flux. This study reviews different approaches for representation of spatially-averaged surface fluxes over heterogeneous surfaces. The scale-dependence of the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> is posed in terms of spatially averaging the bulk aerodynamic relationship. This scale-dependence is evaluated in terms of observed fluxes from three different field programs. The effective drag coefficient is found to be more scale-dependent than the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> for heat and momentum. The effective conductance is found to be less scale-dependent than the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> and effective resistance. Except for the case of weak flow over strong surface heterogeneity, the <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> is nearly independent of grid size...|$|R

40|$|We made {{observations}} from vertical moorings of thermistors and current meters in Lake Ontario {{to study the}} spring thermal bar circulation, its effect in inhibiting the horizontal mixing, and spatial and temporal variability of vertical mixing during this period. Thermal bar progression rates were compared with two analytical models; both produced overestimates during {{the early part of}} the thermal bar and underestimates during the late spring. In a zone between the shore and the thermal bar, currents were influenced by the local wind stress and flowed in a counter-clockwise direction. The mean cross-shore flows in the nearshore zone were reduced during the thermal bar period. The alongshore horizontal <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> were higher than cross-shore <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients.</b> During the thermal bar period, the magnitude of both alongshore and cross-shore <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> decreased when the bar was still within middepth (, 40 m); when it was further offshore, the thermal bar did not have any significant effect on alongshore <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients,</b> but cross-shore <b>exchanges</b> decreased marginally. The vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> were high in the water column because of convective mixing during the thermal bar period. During the evolution of spring thermal bar, the vertical mixing decreased considerably in the nearshore regions under stable stratification, whereas the high vertical mixing levels continued in the offshore region for a longer period.

30|$|By {{allowing}} <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange</b> {{of information}} in the system, new critical points were observed for Random and Neighbor (3). The rate at which stationary state number increased {{was significantly higher than}} without <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange</b> in Neighbor. However, it was much slower in Random in which it rose to maximum of 65 iterations whereas it was as high as 203 without <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange</b> (3). Thus, the time needed for the crowd to converge to a concerted opinion is found to be significantly lower under this configuration for Random type of interaction. The reason for decreased stationary state numbers can be accrued to the following observation. There are 3 categories that a person can belong to during interaction: mavens (credence 6), laypeople (credence 1), or others (credence 2 - 5). Thus, there is a probability associated with a person of interacting with another person from any of these categories. Now, as opinion of maven lie closest to the key and they have highest credence, it is most beneficial to interact with the mavens. When there is <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange</b> of information, the probability of interaction with a maven increases with increasing number of steps in an iteration since the people once selected as source and target cannot interact again and initially the probability of interaction with layperson is highest. However, if there is no <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange</b> and time of update is concurrent, the probability of interaction with a maven remains constant in an iteration because the credence and opinion values of people are updated only at the end of iteration. On the other hand, if the time of update is sequential and there is no <b>mutual</b> <b>exchange,</b> then the proportion of maven can either increase or decrease within an iteration because the changes in opinion and credence are reflected within the iteration owing to the sequential time of update. Thus, the probability of interaction with maven is flexible in this case. In both the Random and Neighbor, the stationary state number increased until the proportion of maven became 0.05, remained similar until 0.1, and then decreased. The stationary state number became stable when proportion of maven was at least 0.4 and 0.65 in Random and Neighbor respectively. Overall, with the introduction of maven, the group was able to reach a consensus in much fewer number of iterations (compare Figs. 3, 5, and 7 under this configuration). Also, the transition period started early, when proportion of maven was 0.05, to 0.3 and 0.4 for Random and Neighbor respectively (Fig. 8). The Optimization and De-optimization in this configuration were found to be computationally unsolvable and therefore not considered.|$|R
