5|$|In Europe, UK {{retailer}} Game {{secured the}} right to sell the We are Tekken edition of the game, available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version of the game. The game comes packed in an exclusive <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> including the original soundtrack, an additional music CD with remixes, an art book with more than 200 pages, a behind the scenes video with series producer Katsuhiro Harada and other guests offering their best tips.|$|E
5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a light <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 2016, Doom {{was made}} {{available}} for Xbox One owners to pre-order; for a limited time, they would also get the two original games, Doom and Doom II, for free. Other bonuses included the Demon Multiplayer Pack, which offered a demon-themed armor set with three skin variations; six metallic paint colors and three id Software logo patterns used for character customization; and six sets of consumable Hack Module perks. There is also a Collector's Edition, which was significantly {{more expensive than the}} normal edition. It includes a figurine of the Revenant, a demon featured in the game, and a <b>metal</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a <b>metal</b> <b>case.</b> The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E

25|$|Pocket watch style meters were in {{widespread}} {{use in the}} 1920s, at much lower cost than Avometers. The <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> was typically connected to the negative connection, an arrangement that caused numerous electric shocks. The technical specifications of these devices were often crude, for example the one illustrated has a resistance of just 33 ohms per volt, a non-linear scale and no zero adjustment.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} is encased {{to prevent}} moisture entering the dielectricearly radio equipment used a cardboard tube sealed with wax. Modern paper or film dielectric capacitors are dipped {{in a hard}} thermoplastic. Large capacitors for high-voltage use may have the roll form compressed {{to fit into a}} rectangular <b>metal</b> <b>case,</b> with bolted terminals and bushings for connections. The dielectric in larger capacitors is often impregnated with a liquid to improve its properties.|$|E
25|$|A further {{impediment}} to {{reliability of the}} early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the epoxy resin encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed <b>metal</b> <b>case,</b> initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|Cooling below −25°C sharply {{increases}} the response {{time of a}} photoresistor. These changes are reversible unless the cooling induces cracking in the plastic components. Soviet ROs packed in <b>metal</b> <b>cases</b> could withstand even at −60°C, but at these temperatures their response time reached 4 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{crystals}} {{are usually}} mounted in hermetically sealed glass or <b>metal</b> <b>cases,</b> {{filled with a}} dry and inert atmosphere, usually vacuum, nitrogen, or helium. Plastic housings {{can be used as}} well, but those are not hermetic and another secondary sealing has to be built around the crystal.|$|R
25|$|Permanently {{installed}} electrical equipment, unless {{not required}} to, have permanently connected grounding conductors. Portable electrical devices with <b>metal</b> <b>cases</b> may have them connected to earth ground by a pin on the attachment plug (see Domestic AC power plugs and sockets). The size of power grounding conductors is usually regulated by local or national wiring regulations.|$|R
25|$|Signal grounds {{serve as}} return paths for signals and power (at extra low voltages, less than about 50 V) within equipment, {{and on the}} signal {{interconnections}} between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return {{that acts as a}} reference for all signals. Power and signal grounds often get connected, usually through the <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> of the equipment. Designers of printed circuit boards must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.|$|E
25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> design.|$|E

This required that the propellant charge be loaded in a <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> (usually brass) which provides obduration– it seals the breech to prevent escape of the expanding propellant gas. The 28cm SK L/40 was the last large German naval gun to load all its propellant in a single case; later guns required a fore charge {{in addition to the}} main charge in the cartridge case.|$|E
50|$|Master {{tinsmith}} Jakob Eberspächer {{founded the}} company in 1865, which soon specialized in metal-framed roof glazing. In 1914 the factory starts operating {{on the site of}} its present-day plant in Esslingen.1931 starts the production of mufflers and 1933 the development of vehicle heating systems. During the post-war emergency Eberspächer produces products such as prostheses, <b>metal</b> <b>cases</b> and small cookers.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "SteelBook Case" [...] {{is similar}} in shape to the keep case, but its {{material}} is metal. Products such as Platoon, Fight Club, The Day After Tomorrow, and The Dark Knight DVD packages fall under it. Special releases of some movies and videogames (such as Halo 4) usually come in special <b>metal</b> <b>cases,</b> instead of plastic for the standard edition.|$|R
50|$|However, unlike Armstrong, Krupp {{loaded the}} powder {{propellant}} in a <b>metal</b> cartridge <b>case</b> {{much like a}} large rifle cartridge, which expanded against the chamber wall on firing and effectively sealed the breech. The sliding block, in both horizontal and vertical forms, and <b>metal</b> cartridge <b>case</b> continued to be the preferred German breech system until after World War II, and is still used by some modern artillery.|$|R
500|$|Halo 3 was {{released}} in three separate retail versions, branded as [...] "Standard", [...] "Limited" [...] and [...] "Legendary" [...] editions. The Standard Edition contains the game disc, manual, and a small poster with the game's control-map and artwork. The Limited Edition, contained in a <b>metal</b> <b>case,</b> contains the game disc, manual, poster, Xbox 360 bonus disc with featurettes, and a hardcover-bound [...] "Bestiarum", a collection of information and art covering the species, cultures, and civilizations of Halo 3. The Legendary Edition contains the game disc, manual, poster, interactive bonus disc, the Bestiarum on a DVD, Legendary DVD containing exclusive content, and a scale replica of the Master Chief's helmet as a case for the three discs. The slip-cover packaging unfolds into a large heavy-stock poster of Master Chief. Gamestation stores in the UK offered a limited edition Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 preorders.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{shipped in}} three {{different}} retail configurations: a standard edition, limited edition, and collector's edition. The limited edition came with a REQ bundle, dossiers on the game's characters, the Fall of Reach film, a statue of a Guardian, and a [...] "steelbook" [...] <b>metal</b> <b>case.</b> The collector's edition contained the REQ bundle, dossiers, Guardian statue, and Fall of Reach, plus a commemorative statue of Master Chief and Agent Locke. The collector's edition comes with a digital code rather than a physical disc; fan feedback led Microsoft to offer a free trade-in program so collector's edition buyers could have the disc instead.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the <b>metal</b> <b>case</b> of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E
