40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} this paper is to present a critical review of current approaches to modelling the inter-related hydrodynamic, physical and chemical processes involved in the flocculation of water using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flows inside both laboratory and full scale mechanically- mixed flocculators are complex and pose significant challenges to modellers. There exists a body of published work which considers the bulk flow patterns, primarily at laboratory scale. However, there is little reported <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> at either scale. Two-equation turbulence modelling has been found to produce variable results in comparison with experimental data, due to the anisotropic nature of the swirling flow. However, the computational expense of combining the sliding mesh treatment for a rotating mesh with the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) in a full scale unit is great, even when using a high performance computing facility. Future work should focus more on the <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> aspects. Whilst opportunities exist for particle tracking using a Lagrangian model, few workers have attempted this. The fractal nature of flocs poses limitations on the accuracy of the results generated and, in particular, the impacts of density and porosity on drag force and settlement characteristics require additional work. There is significant scope for the use of coupled population balance models and CFD to develop water treatment flocculation models. Results from related work in the wastewater flocculation field are encouraging...|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} modelling of single-phase and multiphase flows {{was used to}} simulate the temperature and relative humidity at various locations in an empty rubber-sheet drying chamber. In all planes, unlike the single-phase <b>model,</b> the <b>multiphase</b> <b>model’s</b> temperature distribution is relatively uniform, and the temperature deviations are 0. 01 - 4. 73 °C in the bottom plane, 0. 02 - 4. 05 °C in the middle plane, and 0. 01 - 3. 84 °C in the top plane. The single-phase model results in temperature deviations of 0. 55 - 6. 63 °C, 0. 02 - 6. 02 °C and 0. 36 - 3. 89 °C in the bottom, middle and top planes respectively. Thus, the <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> is deemed superior. The inclusion of water vapour in the <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> increases the agreement between model and experimental temperature data.

40|$|The mass, {{momentum}} and energy fluxes between {{the atmosphere and}} ocean surface depend {{on the state of}} the ocean surface.

These interactions can be modelled deterministically using a <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> approach or using a semi-stochastic approach. While the multiphase approach can give better insights (e. g. wave generation), it is computationally too expensive and not suited for modelling ocean waves which are inherently random in nature.

Furthermore, even in a semi-stochastic approach ocean and atmospheric models can be coupled in either unidirectional way (ocean affecting the atmosphere) or bidirectional way (both ocean and atmosphere affecting each other).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a finite-element {{analysis}} of the initiation of a slope failure in a small-scale laboratory test due to pore pressure variation. To this aim, a fully coupled multiphase model for saturated/partially saturated solid porous materials based on porous media mechanics is used. Design/methodology/approach – The slope is described as a three-phase deforming porous continuum where heat, water and gas flow are taken into account. The gas phase is modelled as an ideal gas composed of dry air and water vapour. Phase changes of water, heat transfer through conduction and convection and latent heat transfer are considered. The independent variables are: solid displacements, capillary pressure, gas pressure and temperature. The effective stress state is limited by Drucker-Prager yield surface for the sake of simplicity. Small strains and quasi-static loading conditions are assumed. Findings – The paper shows that the <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> is able to capture the main experimental observations such as the local failure zone at the onset of slope failure and the outflow appeared in that zone. It also allows understanding of the triggering mechanisms of the failure zone. Research limitations/implications – This work can be considered as a step towards a further development of a suitable numerical model for the simulation of non-isothermal geo-environmental engineering problems. Practical implications – The multiphysics approach looks promising for the analysis of the onset of landslides, provided that the constitutive models for the multiphase porous media in saturated/unsaturated conditions and the related mechanical and hydraulic properties are described with sufficient accuracy.

The intermediate grid with 420 K cells was used for this work in interest to minimise the computational time. Furthermore,the unsteady solver was perform due to the experimental measurement usually taken time averaged quantities which is mimic to unsteady solver. As for influence of discretization method,the second order scheme was used for eliminate the error due to numerical diffusion.

A great potential of the Detached Eddy Simulation with unsteady conditions for predicting the flow pattern in a co-current spray dryer was uncovered as its provides more accurate predictions compared to the other models tested in this work. CFD analysis was also performed for the tall and short pilot scale spray dryer. The CFD analysis shows that the residence time for particles inside the tall chamber is much longer than those of shorter drying chamber due to intensive recirculation. Further analysis on the CFD results also uncovered a longer residence time for smaller particles as they tend to move around with the air flow and hence resulting in poor product quality. CFD may be used to further optimise the hydrodynamics in the spray dryer and hence improving product quality.

40|$|Urban {{drainage}} networks {{contain a}} large number of structures; the most common of which is a manhole. Previous studies investigating solute transport through manholes identified a threshold level of surcharge at which the hydraulic conditions in the manholes sharply altered. At high levels of surcharge, a dead zone formed above the main jet, potentially retaining solute for later discharge. This phenomenon could have significant impacts on the results obtained from 1 D urban drainage network models which only consider pure advection. Previous research (including other CFD based studies) concentrated on steady flow conditions through these structures which are not thought to be representative of the dynamic flow conditions experienced in practice. During large storm events, the capacity of combined sewer networks may be exceeded. This leads to the discharge of untreated sewage to receiving watercourses. Discharges such as these are governed by legislation and, therefore, an understanding of pollutant transfer through urban drainage networks is required. Using existing laboratory and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, this study produced a primary and secondary validated methodology for meshing and modelling manholes using CFD. This was then extended to free-surface <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> allowing for more realistic unsteady conditions to be considered. This included an in-depth comparison of suitable turbulence models and solute-modelling options. It was found that, whilst it was possible to model multiphase free-surface flow within such a structure, it was unnecessarily computationally expensive as temporal changes in the flow field are rapid when compared with a practical time-step for use with 1 D models. The validated modelling methodology was then used to recreate the original study that identified the hydraulic threshold. This included a selection of manholes with a range of inlet to manhole diameter ratios. However, this was extended further to include manholes with a ratio less than five (commonly found in UK sewer systems). It was shown that the hydraulic threshold broke down below this limit, removing the need for this to be modelled in 1 D systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} like Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) {{are among}} the most widespread groundwater contaminants worldwide and are often released into the subsoil as Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPL). Due to common knowledge, the DNAPL moves vertically through the vadose and saturated zone. On capillary barriers e. g. the capillary fringe, it pools until the accumulated mass exceeds the entry pressure and continues its downward movement. Encountering impermeable layers, it follows gravity-driven the inclination of the barrier. At site investigations, DNAPLs are sometimes not only observed straight below of the original contamination source zone, but also in the downstream direction. Possible explanations are the existence of a second, undocumented point source or preferential flow paths in the subsurface due to high permeable geological layers. Apart from these aspects, another possible explanation is the conveyance of the DNAPL with high groundwater flow velocities, which can occur in gravel-sandy narrowing aquifers or in aquifers which are influenced by human activities, such as pumping. Although a lot of research is done in the area of DNAPL migration in the saturated zone with respect to influences of small and large scale heterogeneities (Bradford et al., 2003; Broholm et al., 2005; Fagerlund et al., 2006; Illangasekare et al., 1995; Jawitz et al., 2005; Kueper and Frind, 1988; Page et al., 2007; Rivett and Feenstra, 2005; Saenton et al., 2002), dissolution processes (Falta, 2003; Falta et al., 2005; Fure et al., 2006; Rivett and Feenstra, 2005; Zhu and Sykes, 2000) and mass flux (Christ et al., 2009; Fure et al., 2006; Illangasekare et al., 2006; Jellali et al., 2003; Page et al., 2007; Soga et al., 2004), there has as far as the authors know, not yet been a distinct focus on the influence of high groundwater flow velocities on the distribution, geometry and location of a DNAPL source zone. Moreover, studies of Sale and McWhorter (2001) and Miles et al. (2008) revealed, that one key parameter for the dissolution process and persistence of NAPLs within the saturated zone is the geometry and orientation of the NAPL source zone within the water flow. Therefore, the knowledge of the behaviour of a NAPL under different flow regimes as well as its position and orientation within the groundwater body becomes vital for site investigation and for the conceptual design of remediation plans and actions. In our previous studies we used a coupled approach of 2 D small-scale laboratory experiments and <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> with the software TMVOC (Pruess and Battistelli, 2002) to define to what extent groundwater flow velocities affect the distribution of a TCE DNAPL body in the saturated zone under homogeneous conditions (Erning et al., 2010, submitted; Erning et al., 2009; Luciano et al., 2010). The results of these first investigations are briefly shown at the beginning of chapter 3. Summarized they revealed that the position of the DNAPL pool, its length and its maximum saturation are already influenced at groundwater flow velocities of 0. 05 m/d in the homogeneous set-up. However, the changes were negligible in relation to the overall size of the DNAPL pool as long as flow velocities of 5. 00 m/d were not exceeded. At higher flow velocities the position of the TCE pool was delayed to the downstream direction, the pool length was elongated and the maximum saturation, as a proportion of the dissolution processes, was decreased. In this study we compare the influence of high groundwater flow velocities (> 5. 00 m/d) on the DNAPL pool distribution with effects due to a stratified medium by <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling.</b> Different realizations of horizontal impermeable lenses were introduced into the model in order to differentiate the effects of preferential flow paths, pooling effects on capillary barriers and high groundwater flow velocities. The position and the dimensioning of the DNAPL pool at high flow velocities is analyzed in relation to the pool behaviour at no flow conditions with and without the respective geometrical set-up. The focal point of interest is to evaluate to what extent the layering of the geological stratum and the groundwater flow velocities have {{to be taken into account}} for general aspects of site investigation...|$|E

Analyses of palaeomagnetic samples have been used for the past fifty years to improve our understanding of many of the Earth's major processes. Recent studies utilising newly developed imaging techniques, namely holographic transmission electron microscopy, have for the first time allowed direct observations of the magnetic structure in palaeomagnetic samples on a nanoscale. It is commonly observed that igneous rocks contain closely packed magnetic lamellae with a non-magnetic matrix, a result of the chemical process of exsolution. However, the results of current micromagnetic models, generated to predict the magnetic structure within such samples, are not in agreement with these direct observations. The results do, however, show strong similarities to the direct observations. The discrepancies between the direct observations and micromagnetic models indicate a lack of understanding of the magnetic interactions within such samples. To examine this two distinct hypotheses have been tested. Firstly, the geometry of the system has been altered to examine the effect of this on the magnetic structure of the grains. Secondly, a <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> has been produced. This <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> allows the simulation of more complicated systems that include more than one magnetic material in direct contact.

The need for more efficient systems in industries {{has led to the}} study of fluid flow within the tanks upon agitation; so that {{a better understanding of the}} phenomena can help in the optimisation of the tanks. In the recent years, efforts have been made towards the development of predictive methods using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Among the various numerical works presented, emphasis was laid mainly on single phase systems. However, due to the various processes involving gas-liquid systems, the need for <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> of stirred tanks became increasingly important. This has led to more research studies involving multiphase flows. Most of the work reported showed good prediction of the velocity data and the power draw, reasonable turbulence parameters. But, the prediction of the gas hold-up was rarely well established. Therefore, the aim of this thesis, based on the numerical work presented by Engelbrecht (2006), is to investigate the discrepancies reported and to develop a multiphase model of a stirred tank agitated by a Rushton turbine. The commercially available CFD code FLUENT@ was used to model the agitated gas-liquid system. The results were validated with the numerical work of Engelbrecht (2006) and the experimental work presented by Deglon (1998). Two main cases were investigated, with a steady state and a transient approach. The QUICK scheme was used for the discretisation of the volume fraction and momentum and the first order upwind scheme for the discretisation of the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate. The standard k - E turbulence model was used to account for the turbulent flow regime. A steady state MRF model was used for the investigation of the discrepancy reported by Engelbrecht (2006). The author reported that no convergence was achieved with such models. Solving the problem would have resulted in a good modelling approach for the prediction of gas dispersion, since steady state models are not computationally intensive. Three different boundary conditions, namely, a pressure outlet, an outflow and a velocity inlet, were used to model the outlet of the tank. The Euler-Euler multiphase model was used to simulate the gas-liquid system for the steady state model...|$|E
40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising energy conversion devices for the future in automotive applications. One of the major technical challenges for the commercialization of PEMFC is the effective start-up from subzero temperatures, often referred to as “cold start”. The major problem of PEMFC cold start is that the product water freezes when the temperature inside the PEMFC is lower than the freezing point. If the catalyst layer (CL) is fully occupied by ice before the cell temperature rises above the freezing point, the electrochemical reaction may stop due to the blockage of the reaction sites. However, only a few of the previous PEMFC studies paid attention to cold start. Hence, understanding the ice formation mechanisms and optimizing the design and operational strategies for PEMFC cold start are critically important. In this research, an experimental setup for the cold start testing with simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions is designed and built; a one-dimensional (1 D) analytical model for quick estimate of purging durations before the cold start processes is formulated; and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) PEMFC cold start model is developed. The unique feature of the cold start experiment is the inclusion of the simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions. Since most of the previous numerical models are limited to either 1 D or two-dimensional (2 D) or 3 D but only considering a section of the entire cell due to computational requirement, the measured distribution data are critically important to better understand the PEMFC cold start characteristics. With a full set of conservation equations, the 3 D model comprehensively accounts for the various transport phenomena during the cold start processes. The unique feature of this model is the inclusion of: (i) the water freezing in the membrane electrolyte and its effects on the membrane conductivity; (ii) the non-equilibrium mass transfer between the water in the ionomer and the water (vapour, liquid and ice) in the pore region of the CL; and (iii) both the water freezing and melting in the CL and gas diffusion layer (GDL). This model therefore provides the fundamental framework for the future top-down multi-dimensional <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> of PEMFC. The experimental and numerical results elaborate the ice formation mechanisms and other important transport phenomena during the PEMFC cold start processes. The effects of the various cell designs, operating conditions and external heating methods on the cold start performance are studied. Independent tests are carried out to identify and optimize the important design and operational parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and transportation of hydrocarbon fluids in multiphase pipelines could be severely hindered by particulate solids deposit such as produced sand particles which accompany hydrocarbon production. Knowledge {{of the flow}} characteristics of solid particles in fluids transported in pipelines is important in order to accurately predict solid particles deposition in pipelines. This research thesis presents {{the development of a}} three-dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) modelling technique for the prediction of liquid-solids multiphase flow in pipes, with special emphasis on the flow in V-inclined pipe bends. The Euler-Euler (two-fluid) <b>multiphase</b> <b>modelling</b> methodology has been adopted and the multiphase model equations and closure models describing the liquid-solids flow have been implemented and calculated using the finite volume method in a CFD code software. The liquid phase turbulence has been modelled using a two-equation k−ε turbulence model which contains additional terms to account for the effects of the solid-particles phase on the multiphase turbulence structure. The developed CFD numerical framework has been verified for the relevant forces and all the possible interaction mechanisms of the liquid-solids multiphase flow by investigating four different numerical frameworks, {{in order to determine the}} optimum numerical framework that captures the underlying physics and covers the interaction mechanisms that lead to sand deposition and the range of sand transport flow regimes in pipes. The flow of liquid-sand in pipe has been studied extensively and the numerical results of sand concentration distribution across pipe and other flow properties are in good agreement with published experimental data on validation. The numerical framework has been employed to investigate the multiphase flow in V-inclined pipe bends of ± 4 o− 6 o, seemingly small inclined bend angles. The predicted results which include the sand segregation, deposition velocity and flow turbulence modulation in the pipe bend show that the seemingly small pipe bends have significant effect on the flow differently from that of horizontal pipes. The pipe bend causes abrupt local change in the multiphase flow characteristic and formation of stationary sand deposit in the pipe at a relatively high flow velocity. The threshold velocity to keep sand entrained in liquid in pipe bends is significantly higher than that required for flow horizontal pipes. A critical implication of this is that the correlations for predicting sand deposition in pipelines must account for the effect of pipe bend on flow characteristics in order to provide accurate predictions of the critical sand transport velocity (MTV) in subsea petroleum flowlines, which V-inclined pipe bends are inevitable due to seabed topology.

The experimental part consists of {{the determination of the}} oil bulk modulus, considering the influence of undissolved air by means of a volume compression method in a steel pipe. A <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> of an oil/undissolved air mixture is subsequently defined using Matlab SimHydraulics software. The <b>multiphase</b> <b>model</b> permits the volume compression of oil and air bubbles independently of each other. Furthermore, time dependencies of pressures are mathematically simulated during the compression of the multiphase mixture of oil and undissolved air for different concentrations of the latter. The undissolved air content is determined by comparing the mathematically simulated and experimentally measured time dependencies of pressure increases. Web of Science 617 - 848547...|$|R
