40|$|This book is {{concerned}} with the concept of accountability for all goods used in an industrialized society. This includes basic <b>materials,</b> <b>e.</b> g. metals; production <b>materials,</b> <b>e.</b> g. glass and plastic; waste <b>materials,</b> <b>e.</b> g. sulphur, carbon, nuclear substances and other pollutants. The problem is to account carefully for these materials during their use to see where they are accumulated or disposed and in what quantities with a view to taking a significant step towards complete recycling.

50|$|Literary critics {{initially}} classified Bacovia as a Symbolist, {{but later}} criticism {{has argued that}} he transcended his milieu to form a part of modern Romanian poetry. Even if his first volume of poetry, Plumb (1916), was heavily marked by {{the influence of the}} Symbolists, his subsequent volumes, such as Scântei galbene, show his discovery of a more modern poetic concept, closer to the prose-poem than to the classic verse forms of the 19th century. Interwar critics saw in Bacovia either a Neosymbolist (George Călinescu) or a minor poet with insufficient <b>material</b> (<b>E.</b> Lovinescu). Just after the Second World War, however, Bacovia's poetry began to be linked to newer currents of thought, being linked with and compared to the theatre of the absurd (M. Petroveanu), poetic modernism, surrealism, automatic writing, imagism, expressionism, and even philosophic movements like existentialism (Ion Caraion). Bacovia thus succeeded in becoming {{recognized as one of the}} most important Romanian poets, an author who executed a vast canonical leap from minor poet to enduring classic of Romanian literature.|$|E
