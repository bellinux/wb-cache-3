40|$|Airborne {{respirable dust}} (ARD) (< 5 mm) {{in the stable}} {{environment}} is strongly implicated in equine asthma. Bedding, forage, ventilation rate, and stable management activities all contribute to ARD. This study investigated the relationship between ARD in the breathing zone (BZ) and the stable zone (SZ) in eight American barns (ABs) and eight stable complexes with individual stables under four different management regimes. Airborne respirable dust was measured in eight replicate stables per regime in ABs (n ¼ 32) and eight per regime in single stables (n ¼ 32). Regimes were as follows: (1) steamed hay and shavings; (2) <b>dry</b> <b>hay</b> and shavings; (3) haylage and straw; and (4) <b>dry</b> <b>hay</b> and straw. Samples were taken in quite periods between 3 PM and 4 PM hours. Airborne respirable dust levels were analyzed using Split-Plot analysis of variance and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (Genstat 15) with P <. 05 as significant. The lowest ARD (< 360 RP/L air) was found for shavings and steamed hay in AB and single stables in both BZ and SZ. Straw and <b>dry</b> <b>hay</b> in ABs produced ARD of 6, 250 (SZ), 5, 079 RP/L air (BZ) which was greater (P <. 05) than the 2, 901 (SZ) and 942 (BZ) RP/L air in single stables. Straw and haylage produced more ARD across both zones in single stables compared with ABs. Shavings and <b>dry</b> <b>hay</b> ¼ more dust in the BZ than in the SZ, whereas straw and haylage ¼ higher ARD in the SZ versus the BZ across both stable designs. Using <b>dry</b> <b>hay</b> and/or straw cannot be recommended as a suitable management regime for stabled horses...|$|R
25|$|When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make <b>dry</b> <b>hay,</b> the alfalfa is chopped finely and {{fermented}} in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than <b>dry</b> <b>hay.</b> In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between a hayloft and a mow is significant. A mow is exposed to the weather, only elevated on a small platform off the ground.

50|$|The Slamnik Hayrack is {{an example}} of a double hayrack, which is very rare for this part of Slovenia. The hayrack is an oak {{structure}} covered with red brick. It was built in 1884 by carpenters from Šentjur, who took three months to complete the carpentry and construction work. The structure is covered in wooden latticework. In the past, it was used for <b>drying</b> <b>hay,</b> and today it is used to store farm tools and machinery.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> three different farm sizes were compared, for bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> only one farm size is calculated. Bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> demands more power and investment cost as box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> of loose <b>hay.</b> Bale <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R
50|$|A hayrack (kozolec) is a {{freestanding}} vertical {{drying rack}} found chiefly in Slovenia. Hayracks are permanent structures, primarily made of wood, upon which fodder for animals is dried, although their use {{is not limited}} to <b>drying</b> <b>hay.</b> Other food stuffs such as field maize are dried on them as well. Although it is a practical structure, a hayrack is often artistically designed and handcrafted and is regarded by Slovenes as a distinctive form of vernacular architecture that marks Slovene identity.|$|R

5000|$|Grazing of {{the plant}} by horses can cause nigropallidal {{encephalomalacia}} or [...] "chewing disease", a neurological condition. The disease generally follows consumption of 60-200% of the horse's body weight {{over an extended period}} of a month or more, or 2.3-2.6 kg of starthistle per 100 kg body weight per day. Though starthistle is most dangerous when it is the only plant available or is delivered as a contaminant in <b>dried</b> <b>hay,</b> horses may develop a taste for it and seek it out. Many other species of grazers, including mules and burros, are not affected.|$|R
40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire <b>hay</b> rack. Results: <b>Drying</b> on a <b>hay</b> rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on a wire hay rack.

Both kozolec and kozuc are probably diminutive forms of kozel 'goat', referring to a branching structure used for holding and <b>drying</b> <b>hay</b> or grain (cf. the similarly motivated German Sägebock and U.S. English sawbuck). The word stog also refers to a haystack and is derived from Common Slavic stogъ 'stack, heap'.
