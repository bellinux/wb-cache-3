40|$|Settling {{behaviour}} of polymer conditioned water-treatment sludge {{was investigated}} in this study {{for the purpose of}} a better understanding of a so-called “CML 30 method”, which was developed in previous study to evaluate the optimum polymer dosage in sludge conditioning. The “CML 30 method” is {{on the basis of a}} 30 min settling test in 100 ml <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders.</b> In this study, the series of settling tests in 100, 500 and 1000 ml <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders</b> were respectively performed and the settling curves (interfacial height to dose and time) were the main focuses for presentation and analyses in great detail in this paper. According to the experimental data presented in this study, settling behaviour may be controlled by both the growth of large sized floc and progressively decreased viscosity. The “speed-up” phenomenon in small polymer dose range obviously enhances the settlement and plays a critical role for the settling set in a 100 ml measuring cylinder at a special dose and at the settling time interval 5 - 30 min. It is such special observation that leads to the success of so-called ad hoc “CML 30 method”. However, sludge settling behaviour could be controlled by the formation of networked structure which is involved in excess polymer during the large range (say over 10 mg/l for the case tested) of polymer doses. The higher liquid viscosity values derived from excess polymer will increase the drag force for the resistance of the settlement. In addition, wall effects are likely to interplay with the internal networked structure in large dosed region...|$|E

30|$|In {{the daily}} course of many {{experiments}} in scientific research, there are requirements {{to determine the}} remaining volume of reagents when planning for experiments for logistic purposes. Similarly, with increasing safety audits on the usage of controlled substances/chemicals (e.g. List I and List II chemicals in USA Drug Enforcement Administration website), {{there is often a}} requirement to quickly determine the remaining volume of substances for records keeping or even for audits. While <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders</b> are accurate, their use would not be suitable for use on hazardous chemicals (e.g. powder), on very minute amounts e.g. the amount of enzymes in microliters (μl) in microfuge tubes, or in cases where sterility, temperature sensitivity, and purity of the solution must be maintained (e.g. biological samples such as competent cells, see Chan et al., 2013).|$|E
30|$|Quantifying {{reagents}} is {{a necessity}} in laboratory experiment planning {{but to do so}} with reasonable accuracy is a challenge when using unmarked containers. While there are volumetric <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the demand of sterility and purity in many experiments prevent their use in a feasible fashion. As a result, experienced estimation is usually relied upon, but this is fairly subjective, and may lead to large margins of error. To ease this process, APD Volumetric App, a stand-alone native Android application enables the smartphone to calculate the volume of the substance in a container through image analysis. Using pixel ratios, a much more accurate estimation of the remaining liquid can be made. This allows the rapid quantification of the contents without the need of volumetric cylinders, especially when dealing with very minute quantities. With this app, more accurate estimations to keep track of reagents for logistics, leisure, and operations, can be performed in an easily streamlined and convenient manner.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The factors {{affecting}} {{the growth of}} bacteria in fresh water stored in different containers, usually glass, were studied in order to reconcile the different results which have been obtained by previous workers. Growth occurred in two sites-in {{the body of the}} water and at the surface of the container-and was affected by the constituents of the container. Bacteria invariably grew {{on the sides of the}} container and were presumably dependent for their multiplication on having a site of attachment; thus the increase in the count per unit volume which occurred when bottles were vigorously shaken was greater in small bottles than in large bottles, and was due to removal of some of the cells attached to the walls. Bacterial growth was stimulated by soluble chemical substances in the walls of containers; Bohemian glass and the glass of <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders</b> were stirnulatory; Pyrex glass and fused silica containers were inactive. It is probable that under the conditions of their experiments some workers have been observing bacteria which were dependent on the glass surface for their existence and which were unable to multiply in the body of the water sampled...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Clay {{fractions}} of eight vertisols and vertisolic soils from Israel {{were found to}} consist principally of a Fe-rich beidellite. Sediment volumes of Na-clay suspensions, obtained in <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders</b> and read every 24 hr {{for as long as}} 720 hr, ranged from 3. 8 to 8. 4 cmV 100 mg clay and were as much as 19 times larger than corresponding suspensions of Ca-clays. Optical density data for all clay suspensions showed absorption curves typical of smectite. The relative number of platelets per tactoid, calculated from optical density measurements, ranged between 1. 4 and 5. 4 for the Na-clays and between 7. 4 and 14. 1 for the Ca-clays. In the Ca-clays, the sediment volume decreased with an increase in the relative number of platelets per tactoid. With increase in the major dimension of particles (calculated also from optical density curves), sediment volume tended to increase for the Na-clays and decrease for the Ca-clays. These relationships can be explained on the basis of particle arrangement patterns: face-to-face arrangements dominated the Ca-clays and edge-to-edge and edge-to-face arrangements dominated the Na-clays. The amount of iron extractable in dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) correlated positively with the relative number of plates per tactoid and with the major dimensions ofthe particles in the Ca-clay suspensions. This correlation suggests hat DCB-extractable iron affects the tactoid dimensions of Ca-clays from vertisols and, therefore, may also affect structural properties of vertisols...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. : To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} degrading binocular single vision (BSV) on performance of fine visuomotor skill tasks requiring speed/accuracy. Methods. : Binocular functions (Frisby/Preschool Randot [PSR] stereoacuity, horizontal phasic prism fusion amplitudes) were measured in visually normal participants aged 18 to 40 years (n = 80). Participants performed 2 -timed visuomotor tasks: water pouring (450 mL accurately into five <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders</b> at 90 mL) and bead threading on upright needles (30 large, 22 small beads, creating two difficulty levels). Task and binocular function measures were repeated in a randomized order with monocular visual acuity (VA) reduced in three-line increments using convex spherical lenses. Analyses used were Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney U tests and linear mixed modeling. Results. : Median Frisby stereoacuity levels were 20 ″ arc at baseline, 55 ″ arc when VA was degraded by 6 lines, 210 ″ arc by 9 lines, and unmeasurable by 12 lines (9 lines in some individuals). Task performance times deteriorated for the large bead task (7 %– 10 % between lenses, total 37 % from median baseline time of 51 seconds, P < 0. 001), and small bead task (0. 5 %– 15 % between lenses, total 42 % from median baseline time of 57 seconds, P < 0. 001). Binocular function measures causing significant fixed effects were base-out fusional amplitudes in both bead tasks (large: P = 0. 010, small: P = 0. 011) and PSR stereoacuity in the small bead task (P = 0. 047). Water-pouring task performance was not significantly affected by changes in any experimental parameter. Conclusions. : Degrading motor fusion as well as stereoacuity significantly affects performance in certain fine visuomotor tasks. This impact is differentially affected by task difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of about 12 years, 30 {{abnormal}} Schistosoma mattheei cercariae were found among a total of approximately 2. 8 million examined. Initially seven were recovered from about 1. 02 million (0. 0007 %), which were examined individually while being counted {{with the aid of a}} stereoscopic microscope. Subsequently, on the strength of relatively high percentages of abnormal individuals recovered when counting cercariae that failed to penetrate into oxen, it appeared that the morphologically abnormal cercariae were unable to swim and would mostly sediment out of a suspension while most of the normal cercariae would remain swimming. This surmise is supported by recovery of 23 morphologically abnormal cercariae (0. 001 %) from about 1. 8 million, by examining the sediment after the cercarial suspension had been left standing undisturbed in glass <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The abnormalities ranged from aberrant tails only (e. g. an underdeveloped tail, or different degrees of schism) or aberrant heads only, to abnormalities of both the heads and tails. A suggested schematic classification of abnormal cercariae is presented. A young, adult hamster was exposed to eight S. mattheei cercariae with complete schism of the shaft of the tail, by pipetting the cercariae onto the shaved abdominal skin of the anaesthetised animal. Two underdeveloped females were subsequently encountered in squash preparations of the liver when the hamster was killed for worm recovery 10 weeks after infection, thus showing that some of the abnormal cercariae were viable. A method is also described for killing and fixing cercariae while retaining some of the shining brilliance of live cercariae, without them becoming shrivelled, granular and semi-opaque, as occurs when cercariae die spontaneously or are killed with heat This is apparently the first report of abnormal cercariae of S. mattheei.

40|$|In {{addition}} to anodic dissolution there are secondary reactions during electrochemical machining (ECM) of metal materials. Among others the secondary reactions include {{the generation of}} hydrogen and oxygen. These gases {{are present in the}} working gap in form of bubbles and influence the local conductivity of the electrolyte, and thus also the local current density. During machining the working gap is flushed with fresh electrolyte and so a distribution of gas bubbles in flush direction has to be expected. The described influence of the gas generation is one significant challenge in ECM process design. [1, 2] In this study the generation of gas during pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) will be examined. Therefore a device is created to analyse the amount of generated gas in a PECM process. The device realises a quantitative ascertainment of the generated gas volume and was implemented into a commercial PECM setup. The generated gas is directed into a <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This enables the analysis of the gas amount through the displacement principle [3].

40|$|Diesel engine {{cylinder}} pressure measurements {{are widely used}} in field and lab applications to support among other control, monitoring and diagnostic applications. There are two methods to <b>measure</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, {{the use of a}} crank angle encoder, which guarantees pressure samples at fixed crank angles, and the use of constant time sampling rate. The last is frequently used due to its simplicity or because of practical restrictions. However, in order to perform thermodynamic calculations it is necessary to attribute a crank angle value to each measured pressure value. But if the in-cycle rotational speed fluctuates and this is neglected, an error will result in the values derived from the processing of the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure. For this reason in the present work an experimental investigation is conducted on a single cylinder diesel test engine to identify the aforementioned problem. During the tests cylinder pressure and instantaneous speed were recorded using an accurate crank angle reference. These where then used to simulate the measurement of cylinder pressure digitized using a fixed time step. The comparison of the two cylinder pressure traces and the thermodynamic parameters derived from them, reveals the introduction of an error which depends on engine load and speed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model utilizes cylinder’s basic geometry and engine operating data and <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure to estimate the apparent combustion rate which is then discretized into burning zones according to the calculation step used. The requisite unburnt charge for the combustion in the zones is calculated using the zone equivalence ratio provided from a new empirical formula involving parameters derived from the processing of the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure and typical engine operating parameters. For the calculation of NO formation, the extended Zeldovich mechanism is used. From this approach, the model is able to provide the evolution of NO formation inside each burned zone and, cumulatively, the cylinder’s NO formation history.
