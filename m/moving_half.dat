40|$|Drive-by {{monitoring}} {{has received}} increasing attention in recent years, {{as it has}} great potential useful for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. Although direct instrumentation of civil infrastructures has been demonstrated {{to be a way}} of detecting damage, it is also a very expensive method as it requires data acquisition, storage and transmission facilities on each bridge. Drive-by constitutes an alternative that allows the monitoring of a bridge without the necessity of installing sensors on it. In this numerical study, the vertical displacements of the bridge are used for damage detection purposes. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe a model that can reproduce the vertical displacements of the bridge when a simulated vehicle is driving through and show how these displacements change with damage. Vertical displacements are calculated before and after damage, so that the sensitivity of the data to bridge damage can be determined. A finite element (FE) model of a simply supported beam interacting with a <b>moving</b> <b>half</b> car is used in this study. Damage is represented as a loss of stiffness in several parts of the bridge. Vertical displacements are generated at a moving reference for healthy and damaged states, corresponding to vehicle location on the bridge. Two options are explored, the first axle and the second one, as the locations to fix the simulated sensor on the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{behavior}} of a combined bridge-vehicle system in which, the bridge is modeled as a Timoshenko beam and the vehicle is considered as a half car model has been investigated using the finite element method. Responses of the beam and the vehicle model have been obtained and then validated with those reported in literature. The limitation of considering the vehicle as a quarter car model and also the effect of taking into account the rotatory inertia and shear deformation i. e. using the Timoshenko beam model has also been investigated. The finite element formulation of the Timoshenko with the attached Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs) has been derived. Then the general equation of motion of a Timoshenko beam element with the attached TMDs traversed by a <b>moving</b> <b>half</b> car model has been obtained by the combination of two previously derived finite element equations of motion; for the beam with attached TMDs and the beam under the moving vehicle. Finally, a design optimization algorithm has been developed in which the derived finite element analysis module has been combined with the optimization procedure. The algorithm is based on the Sequential Programming Technique (SQP), to determine the optimum values of the parameters (frequency and damping ratios) of one TMD, for minimization of the maximum frequency response of the beam midspan under the moving vehicle. The obtained results show that by adding an optimally tuned mass damper to the system a significant faster damping can be achieve...|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{served as}} a gymnasium, a theater, assembly hall, dance hall and {{the headquarters of the}} military cadet corps. In 1892, it was the site of the first competitive collegiate women's basketball game, between the University's women and Miss Head's School. [...] By 1900 the needs of the campus had outgrown the gymnasium, so {{the decision was made to}} expand the building, by cutting the octagon in <b>half,</b> <b>moving</b> one <b>half</b> and building the new gymnasium between the two halves. The expanded Harmon Gym held 1,400 by the time the California Golden Bears men's basketball team started competing in 1907. However, even this expansion proved to not be enough for the growing interest in college basketball. By 1925 only lesser non-conference games were held in the gym, with conference games and important games being held in the Oakland Civic Auditorium. In 1931 construction was started on its replacement, the current Haas Pavilion, which would eventually share the same name as its predecessor from 1959 to 1999. The building was torn down not long after the completion of the new Men's Gymnasium, and in 1950 Dwinelle Hall was built on the site.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: An {{important}} {{early stage}} in visual processing is image segmentation, in which similar regions are grouped together and segregated from dissimilar regions, so that distinct objects ultimately may be located and recognized. In the natural world, objects are simultaneously characterized by colour, motion, texture and other visual attributes. How does the human visual system combine these attributes to segment the image? Although colour and motion information are conveyed by distinct functional streams from retina to visual cortex, {{there is increasing}} evidence for early and substantial cross-talk between the streams. Here, we explore psychophysical evidence for interactions between colour and motion in image segmentation. Results: Observers performed forced-choice segmentation tasks on random-dot stimuli. The dots in the vertical target figure were distinguished from the background dots by a different distribution of speeds or colours. To explore interactions between motion and colour segmentation, we added motion noise to the colour signal (or vice versa) by assigning all dots speeds (or colours) drawn from one of several noise distributions. Motion noise severely affects segmentation by colour. Motion noise defined by a broad distribution of speeds degrades colour segmentation, but a two-speed motion distribution (<b>half</b> <b>moving</b> up, <b>half</b> <b>moving</b> down) facilitates colour segmentation. Control experiments prove that the facilitatory effect is not caused by integrating colour information over different frames, nor can it be explained by probability summation over the two planes of moving dots. Colour noise also affects motion segmentation, but under a more restricted range of conditions, {{and not in a}} facilitatory way. Conclusions: Colour and motion information interact at early stages during image segmentation, before decisions based on either cue in isolation are made. The robust bipolar effects of motion information on segmentation by colour indicate that the establishment of motion-defined surfaces takes primacy, and that such surfaces constitute important primitives for further processing...|$|R
