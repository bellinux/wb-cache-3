25|$|Modern {{commercial}} domino {{sets are}} usually made of synthetic materials, such as ABS or polystyrene plastics, or Bakelite and other phenolic resins; many sets approximate {{the look and}} feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a <b>metal</b> <b>pin</b> (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.|$|E
25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a <b>metal</b> <b>pin</b> pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E

30|$|The heater {{of the gas}} sensor and the {{corresponding}} schematic diagram are shown in Fig.  1 b, c. The heater steel silks on the thermal insulation material are connected with the <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> “ 1 ” and “ 4.” Each gas sensor chip is put on the heater steel silks and bonded to another two <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> so as to constitute a sensor element. The sensor element and {{the corresponding}} schematic diagram are shown in Fig.  1 d, e. When the heating voltage is applied to <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> “ 1 ” and “ 4,” {{the temperature of the}} heater steel silks will rise up according to Joule’s law so as to make the temperature of gas sensor chip rise up. When the bias voltage is applied to <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> “ 3 ” and “ 6,” the electrical signal measurement for the gas sensor can be carried out. The sensor temperature at different heating voltages is measured by contacting a thermocouple to the upper side of the gas sensor chip.|$|R

25|$|In 1941 the Uniform Regulations were {{modified}} to permit officers and enlisted men {{to wear the}} submarine insignia after they {{had been assigned to}} other duties in the naval service, unless such right had been revoked. The officer insignia was a bronze gold-plated <b>metal</b> <b>pin,</b> worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons or medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered silk insignia {{on the outside of the}} right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow until 1947 when it was shifted to above the left breast pocket. In 1943 the Uniform Regulations were {{modified to}} allow enlisted men, who were qualified for submarine duty then subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, to continue wearing the enlisted submarine insignia until they qualified as submarine officers when they were entitled to wear the officers submarine pin. A 1950 change to Uniform Regulations authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver-plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).|$|E
25|$|Fisher had a <b>metal</b> <b>pin</b> {{inserted}} into {{his left shoulder}} in 1952 {{to prevent it from}} being dislocated, but he still suffered persistent shoulder problems. He was a useful lower order batsman who batted in the number 9 position,and scored his only first-class hundred of 103 against Victoria in the 195758 season. Strong performances saw Fisher selected in an Australian XI that played against the English cricket team during their 195859 tour of Australia leading up to the Tests. Such teams were used to trial prospective Test players. Fisher also shared the new ball with Lindwall for Queensland when the latter was not playing for Australia. The following year in 195960, while the Australian Test team toured the Indian subcontinent, Fisher was selected for a Second XI tour of New Zealand under Ian Craig. In 196263, Fisher had a notable performance of 5/18 in one match against New South Wales, helping to bowl them out for 82. He retired {{at the end of the}} season, but made a comeback in the 196768 season.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the other}} end of its {{vibrating}} length, the string passes over the bridge, another sharp edge made of hardwood. [...] As with the nut, the horizontal position of the string along the bridge is determined by a vertical <b>metal</b> <b>pin</b> inserted into the bridge, against which the string rests. The bridge itself rests on a soundboard, a thin panel of wood usually made of spruce, fir or—in some Italian harpsichords—cypress. [...] The soundboard efficiently transduces the vibrations of the strings into vibrations in the air; without a soundboard, the strings would produce only a very feeble sound. A string is attached at its far end by a loop to a hitchpin that secures it to the case.|$|E

Despite this injury, Poventud played an accordion for the occasion. In 1976, Poventud made the arrangements and was the first guitarist in Pepe and Flora's album En La Lucha.

2500|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they are driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed. The killing of the animals used to be done by slitting their throats, but the Japanese government banned this method, and now dolphins may officially only be killed by driving a <b>metal</b> <b>pin</b> into the neck of the dolphin, which causes them to die within seconds according to a memo from Senzo Uchida, the executive secretary of the Japan Cetacean Conference on Zoological Gardens and Aquariums.

50|$|The pin pallet {{escapement}} {{was widely}} used as it had many {{of the advantages of}} the lever escapement but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional lever escapement have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape wheel teeth. They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the {{pin pallet escapement}} these faces are designed into the shape of the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The <b>metal</b> <b>pins</b> also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out.|$|R
