40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{acute and}} {{sublethal}} toxicity of an organophosphate pesticide (Chloropyrifos) on the juvenile of Tilapia guineensis was evaluated {{to determine its}} effect on the survival, body functions and heamatological values.

Lethal effect of each fungal isolate was estimated by {{values of the}} cumulative mortality (%) in treated populations during ten days. It has been established that the isolate 426 of B. bassiana caused the highest lethal effect to adults of Ips sex-dentatus ≠ 96. 67 %, following by isolates 412 and 422 of B. bassiana ≠ 90. 67 % and 89. 33 %, respectively. The isolate 426 of B. bassiana was obtained into pure culture from imago of Ips sexdentatus. For {{the first time in}} Bulgaria the fungal pathogen B. bassiana has been found to occur in natural populations of the pest. Isolates 290 and 290 re of P. farinosus showed less lethal effect to the same host ≠ 45. 00 % and 66. 67 %. It has been established that adults of Ips acuminatus were not susceptible to the studied fungal isolate 290 of P. farinosus.

Vuillemin were conducted under laboratory conditions {{with a goal}} to estimate their virulence to the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch. (Acari: Tetranychidae). Common bean plants with mites were treated by spraying conidial suspensions of isolates at concentrations of 106, 107 and 108 conidia/ml. Lethal effects of the fungal isolates wereevaluated as percentages of cumulative daily mortality due to mycoses, corrected for mortality in the control variant. Virulence of the isolates was estimated based on values of the <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 50) calculated by probit analysis for the variants treated with conidial suspensions at the concentration of 106 conidia/ml. The two-spotted spider mite was found susceptible to the examined isolates of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana. Mycosis caused to T. urticae by the B. bassiana isolates 444 Bb and 445 Bb had fast lethal effect after treatment with conidial suspensions even at the concentration of 106 conidia/ml. The mean mortality values of host individuals were 83. 78 ± 3. 62 % and 68. 49 ± 4. 28 % on the first day, respectively, and up to 100 % in both variants on the fourth day.

In vaporizer bioassay method four different doses (1. 25, 2. 5, 5 and 10 %) were used. Four different doses (0. 625, 1. 25, 2. 5 and 10 %) were used both filter paper (cm 2) and aerosol (cm 3) bioassay methods. Five essential oils (calamus, camphor, citronella, clove and eucalyptus) were identified as potential treatments in vaporizer bioassay. The result showed that the knock down time decreased with increased concentration in clove oil treatment; the Knock-down time (KT 50 = 46. 1 ± 0. 1, 38. 5 ± 0. 1, 30. 7 ± 0. 2, and 20. 1 ± 0. 1 minutes) was recorded at 1. 25, 2. 5, 5 and 10 % /cm 3 respectively.

All the twelve essential oils were identified as potential treatments in aerosol activity. The lethal time decreased when the concentration increased. At 5 % concentration the <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 50) for clove oil was calculated as (LT 50 = 3. 80 ± 0. 1 minutes).

40|$|Monomolecular {{films are}} used for {{mosquito}} control because of their asphyxiating effect on larvae and pupae. Compared with other films, Aquatain mosquito formulation (AMFTM) has an improved spreading ability and flexibility on a water surface. In the laboratory, AMFTM showed larvicidal, pupicidal, and oviposition deterrent effects against the malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi and An. gambiae. At a dose of 1 mL/m 2, the <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> to death for late larval instars was 3. 02 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 76 – 3. 25) and 0. 98 (95 % CI = 0. 75 – 1. 20) days for An. stephensi and An. gambiae, respectively. None of the treated larvae pupated. Pupal mortality reached 100 % within two hours for both species. AMFTM repelled gravid females from ovipositing in treated oviposition cups. Without the choice of an untreated cup, the lowered water surface tension caused most females to drown while attempting to oviposit. This physical control method {{has the potential to}} become a safe, cost-effective, and resistance-proof malaria vector control too...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the toxicity of bithionol to Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in fresh- and seawater and the efficacy of bithionol as a 1 h seawater bath treatment for amoebic gill disease (AGD). To examine toxicity, fish were bathed for 1, 3 and 6 h in bithionol, an anti-protozoal at 0, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 35 mgL(- 1) with toxicity determined by time to morbidity. Efficacy was examined by bathing AGD-affected Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout for 1 h at bithionol concentrations of 1 - 25 mgL(- 1). Efficacy was determined by examining gill amoeba counts and identifying percent lesioned gill filaments at 1 and 24 h after bath exposure to bithionol. For both species, bithionol {{was determined to be}} toxic at 25 and 35 mgL(- 1) exhibiting <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>times</b> (LT 50 s) ranging from 21 to 84 min. Morbidity occurred in the 5 and 10 mgL(- 1) treatments, however, due to sampling regime there were not enough fish available to calculate LT 50 s. Only bithionol at 1 mgL(- 1) was considered non-toxic with no signs of morbidity. Bithionol was more toxic in seawater than freshwater and had no acute effects on gill Na+/K+ ATPase and succinic dehydrogenase, or plasma osmolality and chloride concentration. Bithionol at 1 mgL(- 1) reduced percent lesioned gill filaments in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout by 33 and 27 per cent, respectively, compared to the seawater control. Similarly, numbers of amoeba were reduced by 33 and 43 per cent for Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, respectively, when compared to the seawater control. Furthermore, bithionol reduced percent lesioned gill filaments as much as did the current industry standard of freshwater. This study demonstrated that a 1 h seawater bath containing 1 mgL(- 1) bithionol could be an improvement to the current method of treatment for AGD-affected Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout...|$|R

40|$|The ways {{in which}} repellents and attractants {{could be used to}} {{interrupt}} the transmission of bancroftian filariasis, especially by Culex pipiens fatigans, are assessed. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) is an effective repellent against C. p. fatigans. It is also very toxic to all larval stages of Wuchereria bancrofti. The <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> to microfilariae of a solution of about 0. 2 % in normal saline is about 10 minutes. Other stages are similarly sensitive. Contact with DMP in very thin films is almost immediately lethal. It is highly unlikely that infection could take place under ordinary conditions through skin treated with DMP for at least many hours afterwards. This toxicity made it impossible to evaluate repellency in vitro. An in vivo test of the effect of skin applications of DMP on microfilaria counts gave anomalous results. A schedule for filariasis control, involving education, garbage disposal, rodent control, sewage disposal, and mosquito control, is proposed, and the research needed to allow repellents and attractants to play a full role in such a schedule is delineated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{essential}} {{oil from the}} leaves of Peperomia borbonensis from Reunion Island was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized using GC-FID, GC/MS and NMR. The main components were myristicin (39. 5 %) and elemicin (26. 6 %). The {{essential oil}} (EO) of Peperomia borbonensis and its major compounds (myristicin and elemicin), pure or in a mixture, were evaluated for their insecticidal activity against Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) using a filter paper impregnatedbioassay. The concentrations necessary to kill 50 % (LC 50) and 90 % (LC 90) of the flies in three hours were determined. The LC 50 value was 0. 23 0. 009 mg/cm 2 and the LC 90 value was 0. 34 0. 015 mg/cm 2 for the EO. The <b>median</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 50) was determined to compare the toxicity of EO and the major constituents. The EO was the most potent insecticide (LT 50 = 98 2 min), followed by the mixture of myristicin and elemicin (1. 4 : 1) (LT 50 = 127 2 min) indicating that {{the efficiency of the}} EO is potentiated by minor compounds and emphasizing one of the major assets of EOs against pure molecules...|$|E

Exposed fish were hyperactive, swimming erratically, showed hyperventilation and rapid tail beat withincreased mucus secretion on the skin and gills, gulped for air and became listless at he bottom of the aquariabefore death occurred. Opercular beat frequency (OBF) and Tail beat frequency (TBF) increased with increasein the concentration of the chemical but decreased with exposure duration.
