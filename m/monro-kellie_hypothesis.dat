It appears that in children with craniosynostosis, the expected decrease of intracranial blood is probably not occurring as it should according to the <b>Monro-Kellie</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> This is shown when the brain expands in the fixed skull, which gives a faster rise in intracranial pressure than would be expected.|$|E
40|$|Pachymeningeal {{enhancement}} in baroreflex failure syndrome A 64 -year-old woman developed baroreceptor reflex failure 3 {{years following}} radiation {{to the neck}} for meta-static squamous cell carcinoma. Blood pressures (BP) ranged from 70 / 40 to 240 / 140 mm Hg. MRI of brain demonstrated pachymeningeal enhancement (figure). The patient declined lumbar puncture. Baroreceptor denervation may occur after neck radiotherapy, bilateral carotid body resection, and bilateral carotid endar-terectomy. 1 Dramatic fluctuations in the patient’s BP cause changes in cerebral blood volume, CSF volume, and cerebral venous pressure, resulting in pachymeningeal enhancement. The <b>Monro-Kellie</b> <b>hypothesis</b> sup-ports this: the sum of volumes of brain, CSF, and intracranial blood is constant; an increase in one causes decrease in the remaining two. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} case of craniospinal {{hypotension}} in a 45 -year-old woman with an associated epidural pseudomeningocele extending {{the entire length of}} the spine. The epidural pseudomeningocele was caused by a CSF leak at the T 8 level. In addition to typical low-pressure symptoms, the epidural pseudomeningocele caused atypi-cal symptoms characterized by positional thoracic radicu-lopathy. Craniospinal hypotension was associated with massive cervical epidural venous engorgement, as well as enlargement of the posterior spinal cord vein, which was reminiscent of a dural arteriovenous fistula at CT myelog-raphy. Enlargement of the posterior spinal vein is ex-plained by the <b>Monro-Kellie</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and the spinal analog to enlarged cerebral veins known to be associated with intracranial hypotension...|$|E
40|$|Intracranial {{pressure}} (ICP) {{is determined}} by the volumes of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid within the skull, which is of course of fixed volume. The <b>Monro-Kellie</b> <b>hypothesis</b> states that an increase in volume of one of these components must be compensated for by a reduction in volume of {{one or both of the}} others. If this compensation is insufficient, then potentially fatal increases in ICP can occur. Maintenance of relatively constant ICP is essential for normal perfusion of the brain. Cerebral blood flow is regulated both globally, in order to prevent hypo- or hyper-perfusion resulting from changes in systemic arterial blood pressure, and locally, to meet the dynamic oxygen and substrate demands of different brain regions. Monitoring of ICP and the cerebral blood supply is possible through a variety of invasive and non-invasive techniques, and these techniques are already established in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
