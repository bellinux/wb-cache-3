40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{rehydration}} potential of a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage with several varieties of milk following exercise-induced fluid losses. Fifteen male participants (age 24. 9 ᠵ. 5 years, height 179. 3 ᠴ. 9 cm, body mass 75. 8 ᠶ. 6 kg (mean ᠓D)) lost 2. 0 % ᠰ. 2 % body mass through intermittent cycling before consuming a different beverage on 4 separate occasions. Drinks included cow's milk (286 kJ籰 0 mL- 1), soy milk (273 kJ籰 0 mL- 1), a milk-based liquid meal supplement (Sustagen Sport (Nestle); 417 kJ籰 0 mL- 1), and a sports drink (Powerade (Coca Cola Ltd); 129 kJ籰 0 mL- 1). Beverages were consumed over 1 h in volumes equivalent to 150 % of body mass loss. Body mass, blood and urine samples, and measures of gastrointestinal tolerance were obtained before and hourly for 4 h after beverage consumption. Net body mass at the conclusion of each trial was significantly less with Powerade (- 1. 37 ᠰ. 3 kg) than with cow's milk (- 0. 92 ᠰ. 48 kg), soy milk (- 0. 78 ᠰ. 37 kg), and Sustagen Sport (- 0. 48 ᠰ. 39 kg). Net body mass was also significantly greater for Sustagen Sport compared with cow's <b>milk</b> <b>trials,</b> but not soy milk. Upon completion of trials, the percentage of beverage retained was Sustagen Sport 65. 1 % ᠱ 4. 7 %, soy milk 46. 9 % ᠱ 9. 9 %, cow's milk 40. 0 % ᠲ 4. 9 %, and Powerade 16. 6 % ᠱ 6. 5 %.

40|$|Introduction. We {{describe}} {{our experience}} of using the Medical Research Council framework on complex interventions to guide the development and evaluation of an intervention to prevent obesity by modifying infant feeding behaviours. Methods. We reviewed the epidemiological evidence on early life risk factors for obesity and interventions to prevent obesity in this age group. The review suggested prevention of excess weight gain in bottle-fed babies and appropriate weaning as intervention targets; hence we undertook systematic reviews to further our understanding of these behaviours. We chose theory and behaviour change techniques that demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in altering dietary behaviours. We subsequently developed intervention materials and evaluation tools and conducted qualitative studies with mothers (intervention recipients) and healthcare professionals (intervention deliverers) to refine them. We developed a questionnaire to assess maternal attitudes and feeding practices to understand the mechanism of any intervention effects. Conclusions. In addition to informing development of our specific intervention and evaluation materials, use of the Medical Research Council framework has helped to build a generalisable evidence base for early life nutritional interventions. However, the process is resource intensive and prolonged, and this {{should be taken into}} account by public health research funders.

40|$|Amino acid {{provision}} via {{whole food}} consumption {{has been shown}} to enhance and suppress kinetic and molecular measures of human skeletal muscle protein (SMP) synthesis and breakdown, respectively. A variety of published data exist documenting the effects of feeding on synthesis and breakdown during post-endurance exercise recovery. However, no studies have comprehensively characterized both constituents of turnover during recovery from endurance exercise using a whole-food source of protein. ^ Purpose. The aim was to determine the effect of fat-free chocolate milk consumption on SMP fractional synthetic rate (FSR) and fractional breakdown rate (FBR) during recovery from an endurance exercise bout. Additionally, activity of intracellular signaling proteins (ISP) specific to protein translation and proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was assessed. ^ Methods. Healthy, moderately trained, male runners (n= 8) volunteered for the 2 -wk study. Participants consumed a eucaloric diet that provided protein at 1. 5 g·kg− 1 ·d − 1. On the 7 th and 14 th days of the study, participants completed exercise and blood/muscle sampling protocols. Each protocol consisted of an aerobic exercise bout (a 45 -min run @ 65 % VO 2 peak immediately after which participants randomly consumed 480 mL of either fat-free chocolate milk (MILK) or an isocaloric, non-nitrogenous control beverage (CON). Blood was sampled and muscle biopsies taken from the participants following the exercise bout. ^ Stable amino acid isotope infusions (L-[Ring- 2 H 5]Phe and [15 N]Phe) were used to measure FSR and FBR of the skeletal muscle protein via the direct incorporation method and tracee-release method, respectively. Chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26 S proteasome β 5 subunits was assessed using a fluorescence-based assay. Standard Western blotting techniques were used to determine phosphorylation of translationally-relevant proteins mTOR, Akt, eIF 4 E-BP 1, rp-S 6, eEF 2, and FOXO 3 a; expression of the proteasome subunit PSMA 2 and ubiquitin; and activity of the cysteine protease caspase- 3. Plasma insulin was measured using an ELISA. ^ Results. FSR was greater during recovery in the <b>MILK</b> <b>trial</b> compared to CON (p= 0. 05). Spurious plasma [15 N]Phe enrichment data prevented viable FBR data calculation. Phosphorylation of eIF 4 E-BP 1 increased during recovery after consuming MILK (p= 0. 005), while there was no change after CON consumption. Akt phosphorylation decreased after consuming both MILK (p= 0. 003) and CON (p= 0. 005). FOXO 3 a phosphorylation decreased after CON consumption (p= 0. 004), but there was no change in the <b>MILK</b> <b>trial.</b> Activity of caspase- 3 decreased following MILK consumption (p= 0. 004), while there was no activity change in the CON trial. Activity of the 26 S proteasome core increased after CON consumption (p= 0. 004), while MILK maintained activity during recovery. There was no change in phosphorylation of mTOR, rp-S 6, or eEF 2 or total expression of PSMA 2 or ubiquitin during recovery in either the <b>MILK</b> or CON <b>trials.</b> Plasma insulin at t= 150 min (30 min into recovery) was greater in response to drinking MILK compared to CON (p= 0. 03). ^ Conclusions. These data show enhanced signaling of important translational proteins, suppression of proteolytic constituents, and increased synthesis of skeletal muscle protein during endurance exercise recovery in response to fat-free chocolate milk consumed at the onset of recovery. Athletes and individuals interested in optimizing post-exercise nutrient intake can consider fat-free chocolate milk as a practical and economical alternative when considering skeletal muscle repair. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Formula feeding or {{overweight}} {{in infancy}} {{may increase the}} later risk of obesity, but the mechanisms involved are uncertain. Because obesity is associated with high leptin concentrations relative to fat mass, programming of leptin con-centrations may be one mechanism by which early nutrition influences later obesity. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that high nutrient intake or formula feeding in infancy programs greater leptin concentra-tions relative to fat mass in later life. Design: Serum leptin concentrations were measured by radio-immunoassay in 197 adolescents aged 13 – 16 y who were born preterm and randomly assigned at birth to receive either a nutrient-enriched preterm formula or banked donated breast <b>milk</b> (<b>trial</b> 1) or a preterm formula or a standard formula (trial 2). Fat mass was estimated {{with the use of}} bioelectrical impe-dance analysis. Results: After combining the results of trials 1 and 2 as planned, the ratio of leptin to fat mass was significantly greater in the children who received the preterm formula (geo-metric x–: 0. 84 g · L 1 · kg 1) than in those who received stan-dard formula or banked breast milk (0. 62 g · L 1 · kg 1; mean difference: 30. 8 %; 95 % CI for difference: 8. 4 %, 53. 2 %; P = 0. 007). The difference between the diet groups remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, Tanner stage, social class, and fat mass. Human milk intake was significantly associated with lower leptin concentrations relative to fat mass in adolescence (P = 0. 023), independent of potential confounding factors.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether ingestion of milk thistle affects the pharmacokinetics of indinavir. Methods: We conducted a three-period, randomized controlled trial with 16 healthy participants. We randomized participants to milk thistle or control. All participants received initial dosing of indinavir, and baseline indinavir levels were obtained (AUC 0 - 8) (phase I). The active group were then given 450 mg milk-thistle extract capsules {{to be taken}} t. i. d. from day 2 to day 30. The control group received no plant extract. On day 29 and day 30, indinavir dosing and sampling was repeated in both groups as before (phase II).

Results: All participants completed the trial, but two were excluded from analysis due to protocol violation. There were no significant between-group differences. Active group mean AUC 0 - 8 indinavir decreased by 4. 4 % (90 % CI, – 27. 5 % to – 26 %, P= 0. 78) from phase I to phase II in the active group, and by 17. 3 % (90 % CI, – 37. 3 % to + 9 %, P= 0. 25) in phase III.

40|$|Due to the finicky {{nature of}} the {{domestic}} cats' feeding habits, palatability is a highly complex area of feline nutrition, but one which is vitally important, with pet owners today selecting a brand based on palatability rather than nutritional value (Trivedi and Benning 1999). To date there is little published literature about the specific compounds and ingredients responsible for the palatability of cat foods, however, some animal by-products, particularly fish offals have been reported as being highly palatable to the cat (MacDonald et al. 1984). There is much interest {{in the use of}} synthetic diets for palatability testing because these diets can be easily manipulated to control specific properties of the diet. The aims of this study, using the domestic cat as the test species were to: (1) test the efficacy of using synthetic diets in palatability trials, (2) determine the palatability of various fish by-products when included in synthetic and commercially canned diets, (3) develop a method suitable for fractionating fish by-products and fractionate selected by-products. (4) determine the palatability of the fish by-product fractions obtained and (5) determine the palatability of various pure compounds when dissolved in pet <b>milk.</b> All palatability <b>trials</b> carried out used the two bowl free choice testing method. The freeze dried forms of hoki, mussel, salmon and jack mackerel by-products were included in a synthetic diet and compared to an un-supplemented synthetic diet. Hoki, mussel, salmon and barracouta by-products and the three fish by-product fractions (salmon oil, salmon water and barracouta water) were included fresh in commercially made canned diets and compared to a common commercial diet (control). Finally various pure compounds (amino acids, malic acid, salts, urea, creatinine, creatine, etc.) were dissolved in pet milk and compared to un-supplemented pet milk (control). Feed intakes were recorded daily for all of the trials. The test animals used were domestic short haired cats obtained from the Centre for Feline Nutrition (Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand) and all were in excellent health before testing began. The panels of cats used were either all castrated males aged three to nine years old, or a mixture of castrated males, entire females and entire males aged two to eleven years old. The feed intake data collected during the trials were analysed using t tests, and repeat measures ANOVA. Feed intakes were low overall during the synthetic trial due to the un-supplemented control diet itself not being very palatable. These low feed intakes resulted in weight losses in the cats and the study had to be abandoned prematurely. Therefore, the results are only based on a sample size of two and are of limited value as such. The other three trials were highly successful, with all cats remaining healthy, apart from two which were taken from the <b>milk</b> <b>trial</b> due to health reasons unrelated to these trials. Salmon and jack mackerel by-products were both significantly (P 0. 05) from the control when they were included in synthetic diets. When the fish by-products were included in commercial diets, the salmon and mussel by-products were the most palatable of the test diets, however, the salmon, mussel and barracouta by-products were not significantly different (P> 0. 05) from the control in terms of palatability. The hoki by-product was significantly (P 0. 05) different from the control in terms of palatability. Lastly, the trials involving the testing of pure compounds highlighted that at the 0. 3 % dose proline, lysine (lysine hydrochloride), histidine, cysteine (cysteine hydrochloride), glycine and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were all significantly (P 0. 05) than the control at this inclusion level. In conclusion, salmon by-product was liked and hoki by-product was disliked by the cats when included in both synthetic and commercial diets. Mussel by-product was palatable when included in the commercial diets, but was no more palatable than the control when tested in the synthetic diet. Jack mackerel by-product was palatable in the synthetic diet and barracouta by-product was no more palatable than the control in the commercial diet. Salmon oil and the compounds proline, lysine hydrochloride, histidine, glycine, cysteine hydrochloride and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were highly palatable to the cat. If future work with synthetic diets occurs it needs to be aimed at pre-weaned kittens as {{it would be easier to}} wean young inexperienced kittens onto a synthetic diet than older cats which are used to receiving a commercially made diet. The fish by-products tested here, along with other New Zealand fish species need to be further investigated. It may also be of use to test the fish by-products and their fractions in a different type of base diet in order to determine how this affects their palatability. The dose dependency of the compounds found palatable in the <b>milk</b> <b>trials</b> also needs to be established, in order to find an optimum dose for them to be used as palatability enhancers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Human milk is {{the optimal}} {{nutrition}} for infants. When breastfeeding is not possible, supplementation of infant formula with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids appears to promote neurodevelopmental outcome and visual function. Plant oils, {{that are the}} only source of fat in most of infant formulas, do not contain specific fatty acids that are present in human and cow milk and do not encounter milk fat triglyceride structure. Experimental data suggest that a mix of dairy lipids and plant oils can potentiate endogenous synthesis of n- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This trial aims to determine the effect of an infant formula supplemented with a mixture of dairy lipids and plant oils on the erythrocyte membrane omega- 3 fatty acid profile in full-term infants (primary outcome). Erythrocyte membrane long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acids content, the plasma lipid profile and the insulin-growth factor 1 level, the gastrointestinal tolerance, the changes throughout the study in blood fatty acids content, in growth and body composition are evaluated as secondary outcomes. Methods/Design In a double-blind controlled randomized trial, 75 healthy full-term infants are randomly allocated to receive for four months a formula supplemented with a mixture of dairy lipids and plant oils or a formula containing only plant oils or a formula containing plant oils supplemented with arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Twenty-five breast-fed infants constitute the reference group. Erythrocyte membrane omega- 3 fatty acid profile, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and the other fatty acids content, the plasma lipid profile and the insulin-growth factor 1 level are measured after four months of intervention. Gastrointestinal tolerance, the changes in blood fatty acids content, in growth and body composition, assessed by means of an air displacement plethysmography system, are also evaluated throughout the study. Discussion The achievement of an appropriate long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids status represents an important goal in neonatal nutrition. Gaining further insight in the effects of the supplementation of a formula with dairy lipids and plant oils in healthy full-term infants could help to produce a formula whose fat content, composition and structure is more similar to human <b>milk.</b> <b>Trial</b> registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier NCT 01611649 </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The use of mother’s own {{breast milk}} during initial {{hospitalization}} {{has a positive}} impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants’ prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply. Methods/design EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized {{to one of two}} allocated groups: Group A : domperidone 10 [*]mg orally three times daily for 28 [*]days; and Group B : identical placebo 10 [*]mg orally three times daily for 14 [*]days followed by domperidone 10 [*]mg orally three times daily for 14 [*]days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2 -week period; the second 2 -week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30 % change between the two groups (from 40 % to 28 %, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0. 6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80 % power and alpha[*]=[*] 0. 05. To account for a 15 % dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36 – 40 [*]months. Discussion The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast <b>milk.</b> <b>Trial</b> registration Clinical Trials. gov Identifier: NCT 01512225 </p...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of calcium. It occurs in two forms, a free ionic form, and calcium associated with milk proteins (caseins). The latter association is called colloidal calcium phosphate. New Zealand Dairy Foods of Takanini is marketing a range of commercial milks in supermarkets. The company uses ultra filtration to concentrate milk proteins and calcium in different milk products. During ultra filtration, the fraction that is retained by the membrane is rich in calcium bound to proteins and the portion that passes through the membrane is richer in the free ionic form. The company wanted to develop a quick and an economical method {{that can be applied}} in industrial settings to determine calcium in both these fractions and in other milk products. This research aimed to develop a quick, wet chemistry method to measure calcium in milk fractions and to trial it in an industrial environment. Two methods, the so-called EDTA method and the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (AA) were trialled as potential reference methods against which to compare results obtained by the method to be developed. The AA method was chosen due to its ease, accuracy and precision. (This could not be selected as the industrial method for a number of reasons.) A colorimetric method was favoured over other contenders. Two colorimetric dyes, Arsenazo I and o-cresolphthalein-complexone (CPC) were chosen to work with. Arsenazo I forms a purple complex with calcium in a suitable buffer at a range of pHs. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone also forms purple-coloured complexes at alkaline pHs. During method development with Arsenazo I, different buffers were trialled and a NaOH/ KCl buffer was selected for further development at pH 12. The method worked well during the development phase but with some inconsistent results at times. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone formed clear purple complexes with Clark and Lubs and 2 -amino- 2 -methylpropanol (AMP) buffers. The key advantage of the CPC dye with AMP buffer was that when 8 -hydroxyquinoline was included in the reaction mixture, it successfully masked coloured complex formation due to CPC with magnesium, which is present in milk at about 1 / 3 the calcium concentration. This effect did not work with Arsenazo I. However, the results obtained with the CPC method were lower than claimed values of most <b>milks</b> <b>trialled</b> during development. Both methods were compared for their precision and it was found that CPC method has better precision and was chosen for further development. To improve the accuracy and precision, various denaturing reagents were used to (hypothetically) release calcium from the caseins. Trichloroacetic acid at 25 % was more effective than the several other denaturing treatments tested. The finalised CPC method, using trichloroacetic acid, AMP and 8 -hydroxyquinoline, was then used to monitor calcium concentration over four months in three milk products, skim, Xtra (retentate) and permeate. For all milks, the CPC values were lower than the AA reference values, and the values reported by a commercial analytical laboratory. The reasons for this are discussed, as are other changes in calcium concentration in the three <b>milks</b> throughout the <b>trial.</b> The correlation between the CPC and AA values was poor for Xtra, better for skim, and best for permeate. A chemical model to explain this is discussed. The method developed is cheap and quick, and sample and reagent preparation is simple. The method could be applied in an industrial environment, but a proportionality factor would have to be applied to account for the difference in mean values between the CPC and AA methods...|$|R

In order to optimize the required heat treatment conditions of raw <b>milk</b> samples, <b>trials</b> that involved a combination of different temperatures and times were evaluated. A heat treatment of 750 C for 20 min was the most effective for recovering {{the highest number of}} surviving spores. A sporulation broth containing five different minerals and supplemented with 0. 2 % nonfat dry milk was used to maximize spore production in all heat-treated samples. A 6 -casein based assay detected proteinase activity from raw milk samples that ranged from 0. 093 to 4. 034 units/mg which corresponded to zones of B-casein precipitation in the B-casein agar of 5. 0 and 15. 0 mm respectively, and was compared to Protease Type VIII (from B. licheniformis). This assay correlated well with the fluorescein isothiocyanate casein-labeled assay (FITC), R= 0. 995 (Protease Type VIII).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{improved}} methods of controlling biofilms of thermo-resistant streptococci in dairy manufacturing plant. A method to rapidly and accurately detect viable cells of thermo-resistant streptococci on stainless steel surfaces involving the use of the Malthus microbiological growth analyser was developed. A modified Robbins device was designed and installed in a dairy manufacturing plant to monitor biofilm development and obtain isolates for study. These studies confirmed that routine cleaning programmes were not eliminating biofilms of thermo-resistant streptococci from the stainless steel surface. The isolates obtained were identified using biochemical and molecular techniques. As well as the expected Streptococcus thermophilus, a new species, S. waiu representing 24 % of the isolates was also described. Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridisation) were developed to rapidly identify the bacteria. The cell surface hydrophobicity of all isolates was determined, with those obtained from dairy manufacture being highly hydrophobic compared with mixed hydrophobicity in the general population. There was no correlation between many factors often associated with adhesion (such as hydrophobicity, polysaccharide production, surface charge) and the rate of cell adhesion. However, treatment of the bacteria with proteolytic agents reduced the number of all isolates adhering to stainless steel by approximately 100 -fold. A 55 kDa protein with an N-terminal sequence matching that of β-lactoglobulin was identified as being associated with adhesion, through comparisons between cell proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before and after treatment with proteolytic agents. Further evidence of the involvement of this protein in adhesion was the reduction in adhesion following treatment of the cells with specific antiserum to the 55 kDa "adhesion protein". The presence of the protein on the surface of the cells was demonstrated by immunolabelling. A continuous flow laboratory reactor was developed to generate biofilms of thermo-resistant streptococci on stainless steel surfaces in the presence of skim <b>milk.</b> <b>Trials</b> using biofilms developed in laboratory reactors and on the surface of coupons in pilot plants, indicated that chemicals routinely used in dairy manufacturing plants were inadequate to remove or inactivate thermo-resisant streptococci. Proteolytic enzyme treatments removed more bacteria from the surface than any other treatment, reducing the total number of cells by at least 100 -fold. This was confirmed in a pilot-scale trial using a commercial proteolytic-enzyme-based cleaner. In addition, no viable cells were detected following treatment with this cleaner. Proteolytic enzyme cleaners may be more effective than the caustic and acid cleaners for the routine cleaning of biofilms of thermo-resistant streptococci from dairy manufacturing plants...|$|R

Aim of the trial was to compare the effect of feeding system on chemical and fatty acids composition of Amiata ass’s <b>milk.</b> For the <b>trial</b> 10 asses, from 90 to 146 days of lactation, were used and assigned into two groups fed with different diets. One group received a basic forage diet (FO) with access to pasture while the other group was stabled and fed with forage and concentrate (CO) according the NRC requirements for lactating donkeys. Every 15 days the donkeys were <b>milked</b> and the <b>trial</b> lasted for 60 days. The chemical composition and the fatty acids profile were investigated. Data were submitted to ANCOVA using the model: yij = μ + αi +β*xij + eij; where αi = effect of diet, xij = days of lactation. Significant differences (P< 0. 01) were found for fat and protein content with the lower values in pastured animals (fat: 0. 28 % vs 0. 44 %; proteins: 1. 63 % vs 2. 02 %). The fatty acids profile was slightly different in the two groups. In stabled animals was found a significant higher value (P< 0. 01) in total PUFA (17. 27 % vs 14. 78 %), linoleic acid (9. 56 % vs 7. 27 %) and EPA (0. 19 % vs 0. 13 %).

40|$|Seaweeds {{contain a}} range of {{antioxidant}} compounds such as polyphenols, carotenoids, sulphated polysaccharides and vitamins and {{have the potential to}} be used as ingredients in neutraceuticals. The antioxidant activity of crude 60 % methanol extracts prepared from five Irish seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum, Laminaria hyperborea, Pelvetia canaliculata, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus were examined using in-vitro assays and a cell model system to determine the antioxidant activity of the extracts and their ability to protect against H 2 O 2 and tert-BOOH-induced DNA damage and alterations in cellular antioxidant status in the human adenocarcinoma, Caco- 2 cell line. To optimise the extraction of antioxidant compounds from seaweeds, an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE®) was used in combination with food grade solvents. The antioxidant activity of these extracts against H 2 O 2 and tert-BOOH-induced DNA damage and alterations in cellular antioxidant status was also assessed. Extracts that exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, A. nodosum (100 % water and 80 % ethanol extracts) and F. vesiculosus (60 % ethanol extract) were selected as ingredients for incorporation into fluid milk and yogurt at concentrations of 0. 25 % and 0. 5 %. The addition of the seaweed extracts to milk and yogurt did not affect the pH or shelf-life properties of the products. Seaweed addition did however significantly influence the colour properties of the milk and yogurt. Yellowness values were significantly higher in yogurts containing F. vesiculosus at both concentrations and A. nodosum (80 % ethanol) at the 0. 5 % concentration. In milk, the F. vesiculosus (60 % ethanol) and A. nodosum (80 % ethanol) at both the 0. 25 % and the 0. 5 % concentrations had higher greenness and yellowness values than the milk containing A. nodosum (100 % water). Sensory analysis revealed that appearance and flavour governed the overall acceptability of yogurts with the control yogurt, and yogurts containing A. nodosum (100 % water) were the most preferred samples by panellists. However, in the <b>milk</b> <b>trial</b> the perception of a fishy taste was the determining factor in the negative perception of milk. The unsupplemented control and the milk containing A. nodosum (100 % water) at a concentration of 0. 5 % were the most overall accepted milk samples by the sensory panellists. The antioxidant activity of the extracts in milk and yogurt remained stable during storage as determined by the in-vitro assays. Seaweed supplemented milk and yogurt were also subjected to an in-vitro digestion procedure which mimics the human digestive system. The milk and yogurt samples and their digestates were added to Caco- 2 cells to investigate their antioxidant potential however neither the undigested or digested samples protected against H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in Caco- 2 cells...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study the evolution of milk composition during {{the time course of}} milking. We used 9 dairy cows averaging 56 ± 6 days in milk. Yield, composition (fat, protein, calcium) and free fatty acids(determined by copper soap method) were measured on milk samples collected every min during morningmilking (on one day per dairy cow). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Proc Mixed procedurein SAS software with repeated statement. Milk fat content increased during milking (from 6. 9 to 62. 6 g/kg). Lactose and protein contents slightly but significantly decreased during milking (from 51. 8 to 47. 7 g/kg and from 28. 1 to 26. 4 g/kg respectively). Milk free fatty acids (Meq/ 100 g fat) measured after milkingdecreased during the first 3 minutes and after reached a plateau. Milk free fatty acids measured after 24 hoursof storage at 4 °C followed the same trend. Milk lipolysis remained unchanged during <b>milking</b> in our <b>trial.</b> <b>Milk</b> fat globule diameter measured as d 4, 3 increased at the beginning of milking, but reached a plateau veryquickly. Measured as d 3, 2, it also increased at the beginning of milking and decreased at the end of milkingthat could suggest a reduction in milk fat globule membrane availability towards the end of milking. Milkcalcium decreased during milking (from 1, 205 to 1, 147 mg/kg). Intra animal, there was a strong curvilinearrelationship between milk fat content and milk fat globule diameter, d 4, 3 (R 2 from 0. 67 to 0. 98), a positivelinear relationship between milk protein content and milk calcium and lactose contents (R 2 from 0. 32 to 0. 95 and from 0. 50 to 0. 99, respectively) and a negative linear relationship between milk fat globule diameterand milk free fatty acids measured after 24 hours of storage at 4 °C (R 2 from 0. 13 to 0. 97).

The ability of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) to reduce human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA and DNA in breast milk has not been described. Methods. We compared breast-milk HIV- 1 RNA and DNA loads of women in Botswana who received HAART (nevirapine, lamivudine, and zidovudine) and women who did not receive HAART. Results. Women in the HAART group received treatment for a median of 98 days (range, 67 – 222 days) at the time of breast-milk sampling; 23 (88 %) of 26 had whole breast-milk HIV- 1 RNA loads! 50 copies/mL, compared with 9 (36 %) of 25 women who did not receive HAART (). This finding remained significant in aPp. 0001 multivariate logistic-regression model (). The whole-milk HIV- 1 DNA load was unaffected by HAART.

The differences {{of the amount of}} milk, the fat percentage and the body weight between the urea ration period and the control period in which the cows were fed with mixture 1 mentioned above, were not estimated to be significant at the 5 % probability level. (2) Three cows were fed with the mixture 2 (Table 3) containing 0. 15 kg of urea and 6. 5 kg of raw potato pulp instead of 0. 8 kg of soybean oil meal from mixture of control. Both the differences of the amount of milk and the body weight, between the urea ration period and the control period, were not estimated to be significant at the 5 % probability level. (3) Two cows were fed with the mixture 3 (Table 3) added 60 g of urea to basal ration(low protein ration), this amount of urea corresponds to 0. 5 kg of fat extracted soybean oil meal in protein content. On the amount of milk of two cows, the difference between the urea ration period and the control period were estimated to be significant at the 1 % probability level in a cow and 5 % in another’s. (4) Three cows were fed with the mixture 4 (Table 3) added 5 g of methionine or 10 g of sulfur on the basal urea ration. On the amount of milk, the difference between the sulfur adding period and the urea ration period was not estimated to be significant at the 5 % probability level. The body weight and the fat percentage of <b>milk</b> in both <b>trials</b> (sulfur or methionine adding trials) were not estimated to be significant at the 5 % probability level. From the results of these experiments, we may say that protein feedstuffs are able to be replaced by urea when suitable carbohydrate is present in the ration, and that there is possibility to improve the urea utilization by adding methionine to the urea ration, since the result of methionine adding trial proved effective. 反芻獣に於ける非蛋白質態窒素化合物，特に尿素の利用に関してはMorgen, Beger and Westhausser （ 1907, 1903, 1910 ）・Hansen（ 1923 ）・Hooncamp and Muller（ 1923 ）等の初期の研究があり，尿素が反芻獣の蛋白質飼料の代用補給物として有効で，乳生産に於てはよくその能力を維持しうる事を報告している．その後も多くの研究が続けられてきたが，その結果尿素を給与した反芻獣は他の蛋白補給物を給与したものより乳生産量が大である（Hasting, 1944 ），尿素は他の蛋白補給物と同じ程度効果的である（Owen et al., 1943; 広瀬, 1950 ），全く同じように効果的ではないかもしくは幾分低下する（Archibald, 1943; Rupel et al., 1943 ）との諸説が提出されている．本実験に於ては蛋白質飼料の一部を尿素で置換えた場合及び低蛋白質飼料に尿素を添加した場合，乳牛の乳生産量並びに乳質に及ぼす尿素の効果に就いて研究を行つた．叉Loosli and Harris（ 1945 ）・Starks et al. （ 1953 ）・Hunt et al. （ 1954 ）は尿素飼料に天然硫黄もしくはメチオニンを添加して反芻獣に給与すれば，尿素利用効果が増大するとの報告を行つている．本実験に於てはこの点を究明するため，尿素飼料に硫黄華及びメチオニン（含硫アミノ酸）を添加した場合の乳牛の乳生産量並びに乳質に及ぼす尿素の効果をも併せて研究した...|$|R

Analysed pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and other streptococci. The data set contained 47 563 lactations of 28 695 cows of different parities. Cases of overall and pathogen-specific CM were treated as all-or-none traits. Variance components for the sire, maternal grandsire and permanent environmental effect were estimated using generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function for the binary traits. Average number of days at risk and in <b>milk</b> on <b>trial</b> was 198 days. The estimated heritability for overall CM was 0. 04, and similar heritabilities for the pathogen-specific CM were estimated. Repeatability across lactations was low for overall and pathogen-specific CM (0. 10 to 0. 14). Genetic correlations with milk yield and somatic cell score (SCS) differed according to pathogen. For instance, the incidence rate of clinical E. coli mastitis was slightly unfavourably correlated with milk yield at 150 days (0. 13) but stronger with SCS (0. 74). Whereas, the genetic correlations with clinical Str. dysgalactiae mastitis were 0. 70 and 0. 16, respectively. The expected correlated responses showed that current selection practices (using milk yield and SCS) will be effective in reducing the incidence of E. coli and CNS but less effective in reducing the incidence of S. aureus and Str. dysgalactiae, even with a large relative weight for SCS in the selection index. ...|$|R
