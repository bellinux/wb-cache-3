5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have {{consumed}} {{at least}} 70% {{of their daily}} calories {{in the form of}} cereals and legumes. Puls (pottage) was considered the aboriginal food of the Romans. The basic grain pottage could be elaborated with chopped vegetables, bits of meat, cheese, or herbs to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto.|$|E
5|$|Polls showed {{strong support}} for Obama in other {{countries}} both before and during his presidency. In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, {{as well as the}} most powerful. In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.|$|E

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|The invitations were {{distributed}} among 450leading citizens and {{officials in the}} capital. The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting people that {{would be likely to}} support the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be against Cisneros instead. The printer Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not be problematic.|$|E

25|$|The critic Camille Paglia has {{promoted}} bisexuality as an ideal. Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, {{in which she}} argued that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{identity}} fusion theory {{posits that}} fused people project feelings of relational ties {{they have with}} known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of relational ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes willing to make sacrifices for members of large heterogeneous groups that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> make only for small, tight-knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.|$|E

The people of the Harappan civilization in Pakistan and northwestern India had primitive water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. The flowing water removed the human waste. The Indus Valley civilisation had a rudimentary network of sewers built under grid pattern streets.|$|E
25|$|The {{editorial}} {{perspective of}} the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning {{is a form of}} mental deviancy, thus, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism. Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the intelligentsia for resolving the problems of society. Moreover, in the book Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the intelligentsia derived from the corporate media’s reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the common-sense of regular folk.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} upset {{in the history}} of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the {{scoreboard}} – and it was to set the tone of the match. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have expected Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.|$|E

500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would.</b> In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
500|$|Comic book writer/artist Dave Stevens {{created the}} Rocketeer in 1982 and {{immediately}} viewed the character {{as an ideal}} protagonist for a film adaptation. Steve Miner purchased the film rights from Stevens in 1983, but he strayed {{too far from the}} original concept and the rights reverted to Stevens. In 1985 Stevens gave writers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo a free option on The Rocketeer rights. Stevens liked that [...] "their ideas for The Rocketeer were heartfelt and affectionate tributes to the 1930s serials with all the right dialogue and atmosphere. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> approach my characters contemporarily, but Danny and Paul saw them as pre-war mugs." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nihilistic team {{used their}} {{experience}} adapting an existing property for the Star Wars games to design Redemption. Reasoning that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> {{be familiar with}} vampire tropes, the team wrote the game assuming players would not need {{an explanation of the}} genre's common elements, while enabling them to explore White Wolf's additions to the mythos. When translating the pen-and-paper RPG to a video game, the team redesigned some of the disciplines to make them simpler to understand. For example, in the pen-and-paper game, the [...] "Protean" [...] discipline includes the abilities to see in the dark, grow claws, melt into the ground, and change into an animal, however in Redemption these were made into individual disciplines to make them instantly accessible, instead of requiring the player to select Protean and then select one of the sub-abilities.|$|E
50|$|Another {{point of}} note was that, {{during a period}} of {{relative}} austerity in the early to mid-1950s, the BBC chose to locate The Flower Pot Men in what was plainly a prosperous and leafy suburban or semi-rural area.
