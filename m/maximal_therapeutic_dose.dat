40|$|Epinephrine can {{modulate}} {{mitotic activity}} of normal and malignant cells and exhibit genotoxic potential in some test-systems. It {{is assumed that}} metabolic conversion of phenolic groups in the catechol ring of epinephrine leads {{to the formation of}} reactive derivatives and superoxide anions capable of damaging cellular molecules including DNA. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of epinephrine on human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The lowest concentration of epinephrine used in these experiments (5 x 10 - 10 M) was calculated to be in the range of the physiological blood level of epinephrine in humans. Three experimental concentrations corresponded to minimal (2 x 10 - 7 M), average (10 - 6 M) and maximal (5 x 10 - 6 M) therapeutic doses in human medicine. In addition, the highest concentrations exceeded the <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> 10 -fold (5 x 10 - 5 M) and 30 -fold (1. 5 x 10 - 4 M), respectively. On the basis of the results obtained it can be concluded that epinephrine had no influence on the appearance of chromosome aberrations under the described experimental conditions. However, mitotic index was significantly lower in cultures treated with the three highest concentrations of epinephrine used in this investigation...|$|E

30|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} the remaining classes of stroke treatment medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor (AGTR 2) antagonists, and statins are also affected by genetic variation in metabolic genes, {{as well as in}} genes encoding the drug’s main targets and proteins involved in the signaling cascades (Table  3). Most stroke patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors for blood pressure control and the anti-inflammatory effects that reduce the risk of stroke recurrence [21, 60]. ACE inhibitors have known ADRs, including hypokalemia and drug-induced dry cough and can be substituted with AGTR 2 antagonists. Occasionally, administration of ACE or AGTR 2 blockers even at the <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> is insufficient to control hypertension. In such cases, additional medication is prescribed alongside a high dose of ACE or angiotensin II receptor blockers.

40|$|Synthetic {{glucocorticoids}} (GCs) {{are widely}} used in the variety of dosages for treatment of premature infants with chronic lung disease, respiratory distress syndrome, allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Yet, adverse effects such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and growth retardation are recognized. Conversely, 2 -oxoglutarate (2 -Ox), a precursor of glutamine, glutamate, and collagen amino acids, exerts protective effects on bone development. Our aim was to elucidate the effect of dietary administered 2 -Ox on bone loss caused by neonatal treatment with clinically relevant <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> dexamethasone (Dex) <b>dose.</b> Long bones of neonatal female piglets receiving Dex, Dex+ 2 -Ox, or untreated were examined through measurements of mechanical properties, density, mineralization, geometry, histomorphometry, and histology. Selected hormones, bone turnover, and growth markers were also analyzed. Neonatal administration of clinically relevant maximal dose of Dex alone led to over 30 % decrease in bone mass and the ultimate strength (P < 0. 001 for all). The length (13 and 7 % for femur and humerus, respectively) and other geometrical parameters (13 – 45 %) decreased compared to the control (P < 0. 001 for all). Dex impaired bone growth and caused hormonal imbalance. Dietary 2 -Ox prevented Dex influence and vast majority of assessed bone parameters were restored almost to the control level. Piglets receiving 2 -Ox had heavier, denser, and stronger bones; higher levels of growth hormone and osteocalcin concentration; and preserved microarchitecture of trabecular bone compared to the Dex group. 2 -Ox administered postnatally had a potential to maintain bone structure of animals simultaneously treated with <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of Dex, which, in our opinion, may open up a new opportunity in developing combined treatment for children treated with GCs. Impact statement: The present study has showed, for the first time, that dietary 2 -oxoglutarate (2 -Ox) administered postnatally has a potential to improve/maintain bone structure of animals simultaneously treated with <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of dexamethasone (Dex). It may open the new direction in searching and developing combined treatment for children treated with glucocorticoids (GCs) since growing group of children is exposed to synthetic GCs and adverse effects such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and growth retardation are recognized. Currently proposed combined therapies have numerous side effects. Thus, this study proposed a new direction in combined therapies utilizing dietary supplementation with glutamine derivative. Impairment caused by Dex in presented long bones animal model was prevented by dietary supplementation with 2 -Ox and vast majority of assessed bone parameters were restored almost to the control level. These results support previous thesis on the regulatory mechanism of nutrient utilization regulated by glutamine derivatives and enrich the nutritional science...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} shown antifibrotic effects of {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{as well as of}} angiotensin receptor 1 (AT 1) antagonists, however, prospective trials with clinical end points comparing these effects do not exist. COL 4 A 3 -/- mice develop a non-hypertensive progressive renal fibrosis. We used this animal model to compare the potential of ACE inhibitor vs AT 1 antagonist to prevent renal fibrosis irrespective of blood pressure-dependent involvement by the renin system. METHODS: COL 4 A 3 -/- mice were treated with placebo, ramipril or candesartan. Blood pressure, proteinuria, serum urea and lifespan were monitored. Renal matrix was characterized by immuno-histochemistry, light and electron microscopy. Further biochemical analysis was provided using cDNA microarray and western blot techniques. RESULTS: Untreated mice died of renal failure after 71 +/- 6 days. Ramipril and candesartan both delayed onset and reduced the extent of proteinuria. Both had minor effects on blood pressure and postponed onset of uraemia. Ramipril increased lifespan by 111 % to 150 +/- 21 days (P< 0. 01), whereas candesartan resulted in only a 38 % prolongation to 98 +/- 16 days (P< 0. 01). Ramipril reduced glomerular and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and numbers of activated fibroblasts {{to a greater extent than}} candesartan. Microarray and western blot analysis revealed a higher antifibrotic potential of ramipril in terms of downregulation of TGFbeta, connective tissue growth factor, metalloproteinases and extracellular matrix proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate an antifibrotic, nephroprotective effect of ACE inhibitors and AT 1 antagonists in an animal model of progressive renal fibrosis. The greater antifibrotic effect of ramipril at the <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> employed may not be explained by different antiproteinuric or blood pressure lowering properties, but by-in contrast to candesartan-its ability to hinder the proinflammatory, profibrotic activation of the angiotensin receptor 2...|$|R

40|$|A {{clinical}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the ability of a microdose (100 Î¼g) to predict the human pharmacokinetics (PK) following a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of clarithromycin, sumatriptan, propafenone, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and phenobarbital, both within the study and by reference to the existing literature on these compounds and to explore the source of any nonlinearity if seen. For each drug, 6 healthy male volunteers were dosed with 100 Î¼g 14 C-labelled compound. For clarithromycin, sumatriptan, and propafenone this labelled dose was administered alone, i. e. as a microdose, orally and intravenously (iv) and as an iv tracer dose concomitantly with an oral non-labelled <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose,</b> in a 3 -way cross over design. The oral <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> were 250, 50, and 150 mg, respectively. Paracetamol was given as the labelled microdose orally and iv using a 2 -way cross over design, whereas phenobarbital was given only as the microdose orally. Plasma concentrations of total 14 C and parent drug were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) or HPLC followed by AMS. Plasma concentrations following non- 14 C-labelled oral <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> were measured using either HPLC-electrochemical detection (clarithromycin) or HPLC-UV (sumatriptan, propafenone). For all five drugs an oral microdose predicted reasonably well the PK, including the shape of the plasma profile, following an oral <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose.</b> For clarithromycin, sumatriptan, and propafenone, one parameter, oral bioavailability, was marginally outside of the normally acceptable 2 -fold prediction interval around the mean <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> value. For clarithromycin, sumatriptan and propafenone, data obtained from an oral and iv microdose were compared within the same cohort of subjects used in the study, as well as those reported in the literature. For paracetamol (oral and iv) and phenobarbital (oral), microdose data were compared with those reported in the literature only. Where 100 Î¼g iv 14 C-doses were given alone and with an oral non-labelled <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose,</b> excellent accord between the PK parameters was observed indicating that the disposition kinetics of the drugs tested were unaffected by the presence of therapeutic concentrations.

New therapies, such as antibodies to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), or drug combinations {{will be required to}} further slow or halt disease progression. Here, using the anti-Thy 1 model of glomerulonephritis, the maximally <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of the TGF-β neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (1 D 11) was determined and compared with the maximally effective dose of enalapril. Then, the effect of combining both treatments at maximal doses was determined. MethodsAfter disease induction with the anti-Thy 1 antibody, OX- 7, increasing doses of 1 D 11 were given intraperitoneally (IP) on days 1, 3, and 5. Enalapril was administered in drinking water from day 1. The fibrotic response was assessed at day 6. Results 1 D 11 dose-dependently reduced fibrosis, with the 0. 5 and 5 mg/kg <b>doses</b> showing <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> effects, reducing period-acid Schiff (PAS) staining by 56 % and 45 %, respectively. Fibronectin and collagen I staining was reduced by 32 % to 36 %, respectively. Glomerular mRNA and production of fibronectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), TGF-β 1, and p-Smad 2 protein were also reduced. The <b>maximal</b> <b>therapeutic</b> effects of 1 D 11 and enalapril alone were very similar. However, combination therapy led to further reduction in disease. Notably, matrix deposition was reduced by 80 %. ConclusionWhile 1 D 11 or enalapril at maximal doses reduce fibrosis equally, simultaneous blockade of Ang II and TGF-β reduces fibrotic disease considerably more, offering hope that such drug combinations may confer a therapeutic advantage over angiotensin blockade alone...|$|R

Conclusions: Of the 18 drugs reported, 15 demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics within a factor of 2 between a microdose and a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose.</b> Therefore, data that support the utility of microdosing are beginning to emerge.

40|$|The conjugative {{transfer}} of the plasmid carrying the blaCTX-M- 9 gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Virchow isolated from a chicken farm to a recipient Escherichia coli strain was evaluated in vitro and in axenic rats inoculated with both strains, with or without selective pressure due to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of cefixime. The {{transfer of}} the blaCTX-M- 9 gene of S. enterica serovar Virchow to E. coli was confirmed in vitro, at a low frequency of 5. 9 × 10 − 8 transconjugants/donors. This transfer rate was higher in gnotobiotic rats and reached ∼ 10 − 5 transconjugants/donors without selective pressure. This frequency was not affected {{by the addition of}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of cefixime. Thus, estimates of in vitro transfer underestimated potential transfer in the digestive tract, and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of cefixime did not increase the selection for transconjugants...|$|R
