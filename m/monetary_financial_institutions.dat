30|$|As {{regards the}} {{security}} layers, {{on the one}} hand, Fig.  6 shows that the largest fraction of securities held by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, were issued by General Governments, followed by debt securities issued by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem (1.13 trillion euros), Rest of the World (1.06 trillion euros), and Other Financial Institutions (1.00 trillion euros). Non-financial Corporations and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds play only a minor role as issuing counterparties of the securities held by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem. The fact that General Governments {{play a key role}} as an issuing counterparty of the securities held by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem could be explained as follows. The expectation of the public security purchases by the Eurosystem and the subsequent increase in the prices of the purchased securities may have generated an increase in the purchases of public securities by the private banking sector in order to sell them to the Eurosystem. However, our data, being data on holdings and issuances, are not able to provide empirical evidence of the aforementioned speculation. On the other hand, with particular reference to the APP securities, as we can see from Fig.  7, {{at the end of the}} second quarter of 2017, the largest fraction of APP securities held by the Eurosystem was issued by the institutional sector General Governments, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, followed by securities issued by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem (0.31 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.04 trillion euros). In fact, the majority of purchases carried out by the Eurosystem within the APP until now have been public sector security purchases (European Central Bank 2017 a).|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of loans and deposits granted by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank loans and deposits and loans to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via loans and deposits, we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of loans and deposits granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by loans and deposits to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of loans and deposits by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> in Eurosystem and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the loans and deposits, such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank loans and deposits (4.48 trillion euros), loans and deposits granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), and loans and deposits granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|E

30|$|Concerning {{the equity}} layer, {{represented}} in Fig.  8, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest exposure exhibited by <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem via shares and other equity was to Non-MMF Investment Funds, amounting to 0.61 trillion euros, followed by Rest of the World (0.49 trillion euros), <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem (0.32 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.24 trillion euros). More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via shares and other equity, we can notice that a very large part of the equity held by the private banking system is intra-financial (0.99 trillion euros), followed by equity issued by the Rest of the World 20 and the real sector (amounting to 0.49 and 0.24 trillion euros, respectively). This result could be interpreted as concerning for the following reason. The larger fraction of bank equity investments in the financial sector compared to the real sector seems to suggest the private banks’ preference for investments in financial services rather than in non-financial goods and services. This is consistent with the process of financialization, according to which, a large fraction of bank resources are addressed to finance (Allahrakha et al. 2015), that mostly funds the purchase of assets that already exist, rather than to businesses, that can employ them in financing new capital investments (Turner 2017).|$|E
30|$|Lastly, Fig.  9 {{provides}} us with a comprehensive picture of the existing financial exposures among the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area {{and the rest of}} the world across the considered financial instruments. The comprehensive analysis of the euro area financial system as a multilayer macro-network allows us to obtain further insights on the challenging problem of estimating the financial interdependencies existing between the banking sector and both the real and the financial sector, enabling the consideration of the relevant indirect exposures via the different financial instruments considered together. Further, this analysis {{provides us}} also with a map of the potential channels through which distress may propagate as a consequence of shocks of different nature. Both the insights on the estimate of financial interdependencies and the map of the potential distress propagation channels could not be obtained with a single layer analysis. In order to make more homogeneous the different layers of the multilayer macro-network of financial exposures, we compute weights as percentages of the total assets of the source institutional sectors. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, we remove links with a weight below 1 %. By focusing on the most relevant links (with a weight above 10 %) connecting the different institutional sectors of the euro area via loans and deposits, debt securities, and equity, we can identify the existence of relevant indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector. In particular, as shown in Fig.  9, <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about 16 % of their total financial assets to Non-Financial Corporations, via loans and deposits. In turn, Non-Financial Corporations are exposed for about 10 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. The chain continues both via equity and debt securities to the Rest of the World arriving i) to Other Financial Institutions via loans and to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, or ii) coming back to <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem via loans and equity, or iii) to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, making restart the chain from the beginning in all three cases. Further, <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem also exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about the 20 % of their total financial assets to Households, via loans and deposits. In turn, Households, other than being exposed to <b>Monetary</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem for about 30 % of their total financial assets via loans and deposits, are exposed for about 19 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. From this point the chain starts to coincide with the previous one. These findings shed light on the existence of indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector, and in particular, to Non-MMF Investment Funds, and Other Financial Institutions, that could not be identified if the financial system was not regarded as a multilayer financial network, leading to an underestimation of the exposures of the banking sector to the financial sector and the potential associated risks.|$|E

In line with this finding, I observed a largely unstructured innovation process {{in the development of}} ATMs. Meanwhile, the CDO case showed the use of some structure comprising a process of purchasing, pooling, tranching, and selling. This suggests the use of both structured and unstructured product development processes in the creation and popularisation of innovations associated with <b>monetary</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> I observed that innovation was largely framed in both case studies as a ‘new’ product, with limited explicit framing of innovation in the position-paradigm dimensions, as presented by Tidd et al.
