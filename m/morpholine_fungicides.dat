40|$|In vitro fungitoxicity {{tests with}} 14 sterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (SBIs) {{showed that the}} SBIs pyrifenox, flusilazol, propiconazole, triflumizole and fenpropimorph applied at the low concentration of 1 µg ml- 1 inhibited the mycelial growth of wild-type and mutant strains of Botrytis cinerea that were resistant to the benzimidazoles, to the dicarboximides and to a mixture of benzimidazole+phenylcarbamate (carbendazim+diethofencarb). The SBIs tested exhibited higher effectiveness against the wild-type and mutant strains of B. cinerea compared with some widely used botryticides, such as the dicarboximides iprodione, procymidone and chlozolinate, the aromatic hydrocarbons quintozene, chloroneb and tolclofos-methyl, and the relatively new fungicides cyprodinil and fenhexamid. Only benomyl and fludioxonil presented higher effectiveness than the SBIs. In planta pot experiments with preventive applications of the commercial products Dorado 20 EC (pyrifenox), Punch 40 EC (flusilazol), Tilt 25 EC (propiconazole), Corbel 75 EC (fenpropimorph) and Trifmine 30 EC (triflumizole) showed that lesions of cucumber seedlings by all the abovementioned strains of B. cinerea were completely inhibited at low SBI concentrations of 0. 05 – 0. 1 g a. i. l- 1. After chemical mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), only strains with low resistance (Rf 6 – 9, based on MIC values) to triadimefon were isolated at a mutation frequency of 3. 9 10 - 5. Cross-resistance studies with other SBIs showed that these triadimefon-resistant strains exhibited positive cross-resistance (Rf 2 – 10) to the other C- 14 demethylase inhibitors (DMIs), {{but not to the}} <b>morpholine</b> <b>fungicides</b> fenpropimorph or tridemorph. Study of fitness of DMI-resistant strains showed that these mutation(s) were pleiotropic, with significant adverse effects on characteristics determining phytopathogenic fitness such as rate of mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination and pathogenicity on cucumber seedlings. The results indicate that some SBI-fungicides are suitable for use in resistance management programmes against grey mould...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Tridemorph is a {{systemic}} <b>morpholine</b> <b>fungicide</b> for crops. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop reliable and sensitive analytical method for determination of tridemorph residues in tea samples for ensuring the food safety. Tridemorph residues in samples were extracted with acetonitrile after hydration, partitioned with saline water, and then purified using an aminopropyl (NH 2) SPE cartridge. The purified samples were detected and quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The linear detection limits for tridemorph ranged from 0. 02 to 1. 0 mg L− 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9999. The method was validated using tea samples spiked with tridemorph at different con-centration levels (0. 02 and 0. 05 µg mL− 1). The average recovery ranged between 75. 0 and 84. 7 % with relative standard deviations less than 10 %. The LOD and LOQ were 0. 01 and 0. 02 mg L− 1, respectively. The developed method was applied successfully to the identification of tridemorph in real tea samples obtained from different sources, and tride-morph was not detected in any of the samples. The results show that the developed analytical method is accurate and suitable for tridemorph determination in tea samples.

40|$|Fenpropimorph (N-[3 -(p-t-butylphenyl) - 2 -methylpropyl]-cis- 2, 6 -dimethylmorpholine), a <b>morpholine</b> <b>fungicide</b> {{known to}} be an {{inhibitor}} of sterol biosynthesis in fungi and in higher plants, was demonstrated to be an efficient inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Treatment of the mammalian cells with fenpropimorph resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of [14 C]acetate incorporation into the C 27 sterols [IC 50 (concentration causing half-maximal inhibition) = 0. 5 microM], which was accompanied by an accumulation of polar sterols {{and a decrease in}} cellular hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. Exposure of the cells to the drug affected cell growth. Analysis of the sterols in the growth-arrested and in the pulse-labelled cells indicate that fenpropimorph has, in the sterol-biosynthetic pathway, target enzymes in mammalian cells different from those in the other phyla. Whereas in plants and fungi fenpropimorph mainly affects sterol isomerases and reductases, in the fibroblasts its main target seems to be the demethylation of lanosterol...|$|R
