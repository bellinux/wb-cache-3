5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected {{to arrive at the}} ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the growth and development pattern of under two year age children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter. The research design was retrospective cohort. The Study was conducted in Banyu Arang village, Ngoro Sub distric, Jombang Distric, because this village was categorized as severe endemic goiter area. The observed variables were iodine status of children, the growth parameters such as body weight gain, nutritional status, head circumference, chest circumference; the development parameters such as motor miles stone, and score of pre screening questionnaire for development (KPSP). The result of the study indicated that prevalence of maternal goiter was 48. 21 %, prevalence of iodine deficiency among under two years children was 8. 93 %. Median of urinary iodine excretion amongchildren of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter was 404 Î¼g/L and 506 Î¼g/L for children of mother without maternal goiter. Mean of birth weight among children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter was 3. 02 kg and 2. 96 kg for children of mother without maternal goiter. The growth rate of children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter was 278. 33 gram and 264. 16 gram for children of mother without maternal goiter. The head circumference among children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter was 46. 35 cm compared with 46. 05 cm for children of mother without maternal goiter. Ratio of head circumference and chest circumference were 0. 96 and 0. 97 respectively, and indicated that no asymetric growth retardation among two groups. Despite no significant diference of total score of KPSP between children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter and without maternal goite, but there were 2 (two) children that detected under developed children because total score of KPSP less than 7, and they were found from <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter. It was concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} of growth pattern between children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter and without maternal goiter. It found that generally development of children of mother without goiter better than children of <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> maternal goiter. Key words: growth, development, IDD, maternal goite...|$|R

5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working <b>mothers.</b> <b>With</b> 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> young cubs, {{are highly}} vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> {{one or more}} {{immature}} {{daughters in}} addition to their infants are in contact with their infants less than those with no older immature daughters, because the mothers may pass the parenting responsibilities to their daughters. High-ranking <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> older immature daughters also reject their infants significantly more than those without older daughters, and tend to begin mating earlier in the mating season than expected based on their dates of parturition the preceding birth season. Infants farther {{from the center of the}} groups are more vulnerable to infanticide from outside groups. Some mothers abuse their infants, which is believed to be the result of controlling parenting styles.|$|E

25|$|Studies are {{inconsistent}} on whether high blood DDT or DDE levels increase time to pregnancy.

25|$|Exposure of fetuses to {{cortisol}} during gestation {{can have}} a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants was more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre- and postnatal growth in primates.|$|E

25|$|Speculation {{explaining}} {{a relationship}} between birth weight and maternal pelvis size has been proposed.

This hypothesis would predict an increased average birth weight, which has been observed. It is unclear what component contributes more to this effect; evolution or environment.|$|E
