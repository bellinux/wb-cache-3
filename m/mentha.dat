5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, <b>Mentha</b> × piperita, a sterile hybrid between <b>Mentha</b> aquatica and spearmint, <b>Mentha</b> spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (<b>Mentha</b> aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (<b>Mentha</b> × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{its range}} is {{currently}} restricted to about 45km {{of the banks}} of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England some of these may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. Tansy beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (<b>Mentha</b> spp.), not tansy, acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at this site was in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton Fen, following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from Yorkshire to this site was undertaken. As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10km squares) with records of the tansy beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York. In 2015, the total number of individuals estimated from a survey of this area on {{the banks of the}} River Ouse was 24,000. In 2016 this number increased significantly to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, <b>mentha</b> aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints <b>Mentha</b> spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba, {{one kind}} of Chinese edible herbs, has been widely {{utilized}} for the clinical use in China for thousands of years. Over the last decades, studies on chemical constituents of <b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba have been widely performed. However, less {{attention has been paid}} to non-volatile components which are also responsible for its medical efficacy than the volatile constituents. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method was developed for the comprehensive identification of the non-volatile constituents in <b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap). Separation was performed with Acquity UPLC® BEH C 18 column (2. 1 mm × 100 mm, 1. 7 μm) with 0. 2 % formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as the mobile phase under gradient conditions. Based on the accurate mass measurement (< 5 ppm), MS/MS fragmentation patterns and different chromatographic behaviors, a total of 64 compounds were unambiguously or tentatively characterized, including 30 flavonoids, 20 phenolic acids, 12 terpenoids and two phenylpropanoids. Finally, target isolation of three compounds named Acacetin, Rosmarinic acid and Clemastanin A (first isolated from <b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba) were performed based on the obtained results, which further confirmed the deduction of fragmentation patterns and identified the compounds profile in <b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba. Our research firstly systematically elucidated the non-volatile components of <b>Menthae</b> Haplocalycis herba, which laid the foundation for further pharmacological and metabolic studies. Meanwhile, our established method was useful and efficient to screen and identify targeted constituents from traditional Chinese medicine extracts...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was {{monitoring}} chicken thighs microbiological quality after treatment by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), coriander (Coriandri aetheroleum) and spearmint (<b>Menthae</b> spicata aetheroleum) essential oil, stored under vacuum packaging, at 4 ± 0. 5 °C {{for a period of}} 16 days. The following treatments of chicken thighs were used: Air-packaging control samples, control vacuum-packaging samples, vacuum-packaging with EDTA solution 1. 50 % w/w, control samples, vacuum-packaging with <b>Menthae</b> crispae aetheroleum essential oil at concentrations 0. 2 % v/w and vacuum-packaging with Coriandri aetheroleum essential oil at concentration 0. 2 % v/w.
