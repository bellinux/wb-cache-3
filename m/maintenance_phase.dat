25|$|Opponents {{point to}} the fact that sodium thiopental is {{typically}} used as an induction agent and not used in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>phase</b> of surgery because of its short-acting nature. Following the administration of thiopental, pancuronium bromide is given. Opponents argue that pancuronium bromide not only dilutes the thiopental, but (since the inmate is paralyzed) also prevents the inmate from expressing pain. Additional concerns have been raised over whether inmates are administered an appropriate level of thiopental owing to the rapid redistribution of the drug out of the brain {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E
