2500|$|A toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> into the on/off position. The design for the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|R

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, {{most commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps will have a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> mounted on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by remote control <b>switches,</b> or <b>light</b> dimmers that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off. <b>Light</b> <b>switches</b> are also found in flashlights and automobiles and other vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{switches}} may be {{single or}} multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, the <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current {{may be too}} high for a manual switch. In these systems <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> control <b>lighting</b> contactors, a relay that allows the manual <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit.|$|R

50|$|Entanglement is an {{installation}} {{that consists of}} two neon signs that say “entanglement” on them that light up. The two signs are 72 inches by 14.75 inches in size. The two signs both have a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> that turns both of them on and off. When one of the <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> is turned on, both signs light up. When one of the <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> is turned off, both signs are off. The two signs are placed in separate rooms, separate buildings, or even in separate countries. The idea came from what entanglement means in quantum physics which is where two particles behave as one.|$|R
