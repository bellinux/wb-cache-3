5|$|Skopje {{experiences}} <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> {{issues which}} are often overshadowed by the economic poverty of the country. However, alignment of Macedonian law on European law has brought progress in some fields, such as water and waste treatment, and industrial emissions.|$|E
5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. <b>Many</b> <b>environmental</b> factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

50|$|However, {{despite the}} work of a {{worldwide}} <b>environmental</b> movement, <b>many</b> national <b>environmental</b> protection agencies, creation of the United Nations Environment Programme, and <b>many</b> international <b>environmental</b> treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest ecological footprint data shows the world’s footprint increased from about 50% undershoot in 1961 to 50% overshoot in 2007, the last year data is available.|$|R

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>environmental</b> {{scientists}} believe amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of long delays, <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> groups from France, Italy and Switzerland have worked {{together}} under the umbrella organisation, proMONT BLANC, to jointly raise concerns and {{to put pressure on}} national governments and the European Union to support and make quicker progress with World Heritage classification. In 2012 the organisation published a detailed assessment and supportive rationale into the state of the Mont Blanc application to be a World Heritage Site. ProMont Blanc also undertakes reviews of a suite of 24 environmental, 24 economic and 10 social indicators across 15 towns around the massif (seven French, five Italian and three Swiss), and monitors and reports on the effectiveness of measures intended to deliver sustainable development across the region.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
25|$|Overall, South America is {{expected}} to produce 55% of the world's Eucalyptus round-wood by 2010. <b>Many</b> <b>environmental</b> NGOs have criticised the use of exotic tree species for forestry in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>environmental</b> justice {{issues are}} local, and {{therefore}} difficult to address {{by a federal}} agency, such as the EPA. Without strong media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues {{are less likely to}} be addressed at the federal level compared to larger, well publicized incidents.|$|E

25|$|TNT is a {{reactive}} molecule and {{is particularly}} prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation {{in the presence}} of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> systems.

25|$|On July 9, 1970, Nixon {{proposed}} an executive reorganization that consolidated <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> {{responsibilities of the}} federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency. After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The agency’s first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.|$|E
25|$|Hopewell is the {{location}} of several large chemical plants owned by the Honeywell Corporation, Ashland, Evonik Industries, {{as well as a}} paper mill owned by WestRock. Such industries have required the city and residents to deal with <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> issues over the years, particularly as they learned more about the effects of the industries. The Kepone debacle of the 1970s received the most national attention.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, after {{negotiations}} with Prime Minister Howard, Meg Lees, Andrew Murray {{and the party}} room Senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> and social concessions. Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour. However, two dissident senators on the party's left Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett voted against the GST.|$|E
25|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{is applied}} to solve <b>many</b> <b>environmental,</b> geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for coastal engineering. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, {{also referred to as}} the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>environmental</b> {{factors such}} as {{resource}} availability, predator density and sexual competition are known to affect gypsy moth behavior from its larval stage to adult stage. A population of gypsy moths will exist {{for many years in}} low densities. When the population enters the release phase, the population rapidly expands to the outbreak phase where the population size will rise several orders of magnitude and fall back within only a few generations.|$|E

25|$|Despite Uzbekistan's {{rich and}} varied natural environment, decades of {{environmental}} neglect in the Soviet Union have combined with skewed economic {{policies in the}} Soviet south to make Uzbekistan one of the gravest of the CIS's <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> crises. The heavy use of agrochemicals, diversion of huge amounts of irrigation water from the two rivers that feed the region, and the chronic lack of water treatment plants are among the factors that have caused health and environmental problems on an enormous scale.|$|E
25|$|Situated {{at the tip}} of a windswept {{peninsula}} {{without water}} or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement. These natural disadvantages forced the town's residents to bring water, fuel and food to the site. The first of <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> transformations was the city's reliance on filled marshlands for real estate. Much of the present downtown is built over the former Yerba Buena Cove, granted to the city by military governor Stephen Watts Kearny in 1847.|$|E
25|$|NREM Stage 3 (N3 – deep sleep, slow-wave sleep – 15–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): Formerly divided into stages 3 and 4, {{this stage is}} called slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. SWS is {{initiated}} in the preoptic area and consists of delta activity, high amplitude waves at less than 3.5Hz. The sleeper is less responsive to the environment; <b>many</b> <b>environmental</b> stimuli no longer produce any reactions. Slow-wave sleep {{is thought to be}} the most restful form of sleep, the phase which most relieves subjective feelings of sleepiness and restores the body.|$|E
