5|$|Somerset is a {{ceremonial}} county in South West England. It is a rural county of rolling hills, {{such as the}} Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. Modern <b>man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> what {{is now known as}} Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic era. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming when people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages.|$|E
5|$|In 1449 James II was {{declared}} {{to have reached}} his majority, but the Douglases consolidated their position and the king began a long struggle for power, leading {{to the murder of}} the 8th Earl of Douglas at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452. This opened an intermittent civil war as James attempted to seize Douglas lands, punctuated by a series of humiliating reversals. Gradually James managed to win over the allies of the Douglases with offers of lands, titles and offices and the Douglases' forces were finally defeated at the Battle of Arkinholm on 12 May 1455. Once independent, James II proved to be an active and interventionist king. He travelled the country dispensing justice and some of the unpopular policies of the following reign, such as the sale of pardons, may have originated in this period. Ambitious plans to take Orkney, Shetland and the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> nothing. His attempt to take Roxburgh from the English in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.|$|E
5|$|Homo sapiens sapiens, or modern <b>man,</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Somerset {{during the}} Early Upper Palaeolithic. There is {{evidence}} of occupation of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, {{it is probable that}} Somerset was deserted as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough's Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at the time or making skull cups or storage containers. Somerset {{was one of the first}} areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last Ice Age c.8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline's Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there {{is evidence of}} farming.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the position of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have {{had little to do with}} maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how <b>man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> have a soul. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for the human race.|$|E
500|$|Critic Ruth Miller {{claimed that}} Crane wrote [...] "an {{intellectual}} poetry {{rather than a}} poetry that evokes feeling, a poetry that stimulates the mind rather than arouses the heart". [...] In the most complexly organized poems, {{the significance of the}} states of mind or feelings is ambiguous, but Crane's poems tend to affirm certain elemental attitudes, beliefs, opinions and stances toward God, man and the universe. [...] The Black Riders in particular is essentially a dramatic concept and the poems provide continuity within the dramatic structure. [...] There is also a dramatic interplay in which there is frequently a major voice reporting an incident seen ("In the desert / I saw a creature, naked, bestial") or experienced ("A learned <b>man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me once"). [...] The second voice or additional voices represent a point of view which is revealed to be inferior; when these clash, a dominant attitude emerges.|$|E

In {{the early hours}} of January 16, 1997, he was visiting friends in Los Angeles and driving north on Interstate 405 through the Sepulveda Pass when, at {{approximately}} 1a.m., he pulled off the freeway onto Skirball Center Drive to fix a flat tire. He called a friend, Stephanie Crane, who drove to meet him; she parked behind him to light the area with her headlights while Cosby changed the tire. She later testified that a <b>man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> her window and told her, [...] "Open the door or I'll kill you." [...] Frightened, Crane drove away but after approximately [...] turned her car around and came back. She saw a man running away and found Cosby lying on the ground {{in a pool of blood}} next to the driver's side of his dark green Mercedes-Benz. He had been shot in the head. It appeared robbery was a motive, but Cosby was still wearing a Rolex watch and had three $20 bills in his pocket.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1966, Gallimard {{published}} Foucault's Les Mots et les choses ("Words and Things"), later {{translated as}} [...] Exploring how <b>man</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be {{an object of}} knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period's episteme to another. Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France. Appearing {{at the height of}} interest in structuralism, Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars Jacques Lacan, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes, as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it. Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attacked Foucault's ideas as [...] "bourgeois", while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that [...] "Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else." ...|$|E
