40|$|The {{following}} is a transcript of an impromptu talk. The transcript has been edited and references have been added. There's a mental phenomenon that I call the "Thingy Illusion " – that's "thingy " as in t-h-i-n-g-y – that taints {{an awful lot of}} philosophical thought. I've written about this elsewhere under a different name. I called it by a longer name in one of my papers [1]. I called it the "physiomorphic illusion. " But that's too long a word. Let's just call it the "Thingy Illusion. " The Thingy Illusion is a mental phenomenon in which people tend to think that whatever exists has to be a thing, or at least be like a thing. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of this. The classic example comes from what’s called the ‘problem of universals ’ in philosophy. The simplest special case of this problem boils down to this question: Are the properties of things real? Here's an example showing what this question means. Imagine that {{there are a bunch of}} rectangular physical objects. Those objects are real. They have the property we call rectangularity – the property of being rectangular. The question is, is that property an entity? If there are five rectangular things, is there also a property called "rectangularity " that is an item distinct from those five things? In other words, when we say things have rectangularity, is tha...|$|E
40|$|Ernst Mayr {{notes in}} his book This Is Biology that “in biology, {{concepts}} play a far greater role in theory formation than do laws. The two major contributors to a new theory in the life sciences are the discovery of new facts (observations) {{and the development of}} new concepts ” (62 - 3). With this general perspective in mind, I address my remarks in this section of the conference labeled “Emerging Theories ” on a related question, which is ‘How should we think about language? ’ The idea is that in linguistics as in biology, the way that we think about language strongly determines the kinds of theories that we come up with. Focusing on syntax in particular, {{it can be argued that}} to a considerable extent contemporary mainstream theory is the product of a very particular way of conceptualizing language. If we shift to another perspective, which I will outline here, then the way in which we theorize about the phenomena is in many cases substantially different.

40|$|In the new {{curriculum}} of Chemistry in High School, the investigative learning has been emphasized {{in place of}} the descriptive one. This means that phenomena and materials should be elucidated on the basis of atom and molecule. And the author thinks that this is equivalent to the modernization of education of Chemistry. This would demand much efforts of teachers, because chemistry has made rapid progress in these days. The present paper was written for the lecture for "Modernization Course of Chemistry in High School" held at Educational Center in Omura City, Nagasaki Prefecture, on August 1, 1973. That describes the modernization of Chemistry, based on the case of Chemical Kinetics. Supplement : Environmental Degradation and Education of Science We are very concerned about Minamata disease, itai-itai and other environmental disasters. However it seems that people put the pollution over here and the consumption of resources over here. In other words, people are thiking that {{they would be able to}} survive as long as they could prevent the environmental pollution and keep food and fuel. This is not true. It is no exaggeration to say that pouring PCB and mercury into the oceans is to commit murder, because these compounds cause a breakdown of the oceans, which are part of the life-support systems of the earth, and first of all, the fishes from the sea that are main protein diet are poisoned. Then, could the problem of environmental pollution be resolved, if we could protect such pollution? I should like to say no. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of energy. In order to protect pollution, we need chemicals which absorb poisoning materials. The industry must produce the chemicals and needs energy for the production of chemicals. When energy is consumed, harmful gases appear in the air. We have to someplace get petroleum and transport it. Shipping oil in tankers put much petroleum into oceans. Those are direct environmental pollution. Once we use energy, energy should not be reproduced, and entropy continues to increase in our universe. However, it is fated to arrive at maximum point, where all activities should stop. This means death of our universe. The increase in entropy is indirect pollution of environment which we can not see. We can see that the activity itself for protection of pollution as well as all of our activities lead to environmental degradation, as mentioned above. I should like to show you another example. After we run out of petroleum, we can use nuclear energy. However for development of nuclear energy, we need some resources like uranium and energy, too. Consequently an increase in entropy is accelerated. How can we leave alive as long as possible? We need Education of Science in order to answer the question correctly...|$|E
40|$|Breaking {{into the}} export market CUE: Selling your produce in {{domestic}} markets is one thing, but {{selling it to}} overseas markets is surely much more difficult. However, many of the basic rules for successful export marketing are the same, as Chris Kakunta found out {{when he spoke to}} Daniel Ball, a Zambian farmer who now runs a business selling honey to Europe and North America. Daniel began his honey business buying honey from local bee-keepers, processing it, and then selling it to the domestic market in Zambia. This was a successful venture, and he learned many lessons about good marketing. However, he believed that he could make more money by exporting, if only he could find a way of breaking into the export market. He decided to take a big risk, and bought a large quantity - many tons - of local honey. Now he had something to export; next he needed to find a buyer, and that was where things became difficult. IN:		?It was very difficult because ? OUT:		? and I know their needs. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 03 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Ball on the importance of having a good relationship with buyers for successful marketing. Transcript Ball	It was very difficult because I bought the honey and I found it difficult to find a market. I should have found the market first and then bought the honey, but I did it the other way, and I learned a valuable lesson. And I had to stay for almost two years without selling that honey, but I managed. And when I sold it, I sold at a loss, but the quality was good, such that the buyers came back to me. So now I am busy trying to make up that loss. But I?m not here for one business day, I?m here for the long term. Kakunta	And marketing strategy. Do you think it can play a very important role in production and export of honey? Ball	Well in developing a marketing strategy for something like honey or wax, you have three things that you must consider. Quality, quantity and reliability. Those are three factors that are very very important in developing any market, but they are very important when developing an export market. Kakunta	Perhaps you can elaborate more? Ball	Well the issue of quantity is, you cannot export 10 kg of honey, because no one in Europe or North America is interested in 10 kg of honey. And to have enough to export honey I would say you need between 16 to 20 tons, minimum. So quantity is very important. Secondly, quality is equally important. On the export market, they require a very high quality honey, which means that you must be very careful with your processing. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> if there is too much smoke; if it arrives in North America, and it smells to much like smoke, they will just pour it into the sea. If there is too much water in the honey, people in Europe or North America they don?t want that. So these are quality issues that you have to pay attention to. and the third issue is reliability; whether you can deliver what you say you have. If you say to someone like myself, I have got 100 kg of honey, so in my planning I take that into consideration. Now if they come and that farmer says, ?no I don?t have it?, then it also messes up. So you have to be reliable, in how much you say you can deliver, {{and you have to be}} reliable in your quality as well. Kakunta	I believe one important factor is the price. How do you manage to sell so that you don?t operate at a loss? Do you for instance have market information on what others are offering in terms of the price for your honey? Ball	That?s a good question. And you know I am reminded, today I was in Soweto, I was with some people selling beans. And the market for beans is no different than the market for honey. There is a lot of negotiation even on the export market. But yes we have information, and we have to compete; there are many different types of honey on the market. We have to also push forward and say, ?No try this! Zambian honey is number one! And then also I do know the price on the world market, and so I can use that. Kakunta	How do you get the information on the world market, and how do you utilise it? Ball	Sometimes I go on the internet, sometimes I read commodity newspapers in which the prices are stated. Kakunta	So the information that you are able to get from the market, helps in the planning the way forward for your product? Ball	Yes, and I work very closely with my buyers. The people who buy from me, we don?t just meet in the market place, and say ?How much? OK, I?ll buy?. We meet all year round, they talk to me about the issues. ?Dan you have to be careful, there is still too much smoke in your honey?. ?OK, thank you?. So I am in constant contact with my buyers. There is a long term relationship with them, in which they know me they know my needs, and I know them and I know their needs. End of track. A honey exporter from Zambia explains the ?secrets? for successful marketing: quality, quantity, and reliability. These rules, he says, apply to all kinds of marketing whether for domestic or export markets. He also stresses the importance of having a good relationship with his buyers...|$|E
