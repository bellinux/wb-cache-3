40|$|The {{generation}} of a delayed immune {{reaction in the}} skin involves {{a large number of}} complex events leading to the emigration and activation of bloodborne and local elements (1 - 3). This laboratory has {{over the past two years}} been involved in the analysis of such reactions in the context of leprosy. The lepromatous state is characterized by a lack of specific responsiveness to <b>Myobacterium</b> <b>leprae</b> antigens, the absence of the T helper subset from dermal lesions, and the unrestricted proliferation ofM. leprae in dermal macrophages (4 - 7). To analyze the striking emigratory defects in these patients, we have generated a secondparty immune response in the skin with purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD). In many sensitized individuals this has lead to a massive influx of monocytes and T cells, largely of the helper phenotype, with subsequent changes in epidermal thickness and la expression (8). In the course of these immunocytochemical studies, we noted alterations in the number and distribution of T 6 + Langerhans cells (LC) ' in both the epidermis and dermis. These cells play important accessory roles in initiating T cel...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{forms of}} leprosy constitute a spectrum that correlates {{closely with the}} degree of cell-mediated immunity. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop strong cell-mediated responses and have only a few, localized lesions, whereas patients with multibacillary lepromatous leprosy are specifically unresponsive to antigens of <b>Myobacterium</b> <b>leprae.</b> T cells of the CD 4 + subset predominate in tuberculoid lesions, whereas CD 8 + cells predominate in lepromatous lesions. Monoclonal antibodies that distinguish subpopulations of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were {{used to analyze the}} distribution of T cells infiltrating lesions across the disease spectrum. In lepromatous lesions, T cells of T-suppressor phenotype (9. 3 -) were the predominant CD 8 + cells and suppressor/inducer cells (2 H 4 +, Leu- 8 +) represented half of the CD 4 + subset. In tuberculoid lesions, helper T cells (CD 4 + 4 B 4 +) outnumbered suppressor/inducer T cells by 14 : 1, compared with a ratio of 1. 2 : 1 in peripheral blood. Analysis of the precursor frequency of antigen-reactive T cells permitted us to estimate that there was a 100 -fold enrichment of T cells able to proliferate in response to M. leprae antigens in tuberculoid lesions (2 / 100), when compared with blood from the same patients. The methods used here to characterize the T-lymphocyte subsets and frequency of antigen-reactive T cells in leprosy may be useful in analyzing immunological reactions occurring in lesions of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases...|$|E
