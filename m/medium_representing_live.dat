40|$|While {{metamaterials}} {{offer the}} potential to realize Tamm <b>mediums</b> which <b>represent</b> vacuous spacetime subjected to gravitational fields, practical formulations for suitable metamaterials have not hitherto been developed. This matter is addressed by establishing a metamaterial formulation for the Tamm <b>medium</b> <b>representing</b> Schwarzschild-(anti-) de Sitter spacetime. Our formulation is remarkably simple and does not involve a complex nanostructure of the type that {{is often associated with}} metamaterials. Instead {{it is based on the}} homogenization of only isotropic dielectric and isotropic magnetic component mediums, which are distributed randomly as oriented spheroidal particles. Using the inverse Bruggeman homogenization formalism, we demonstrated that a wide range of constitutive parameter values for the Tamm medium may be accessed through varying the particle shape, volume fraction or relative permittivity and relative permeability of the component mediums. The presented formulation is appropriate for the regions of spacetime which lie outside the event horizon for Schwarzschild spacetime and inside the event horizon for de Sitter spacetime; there are no such restrictions for anti-de Sitter spacetime...|$|R
