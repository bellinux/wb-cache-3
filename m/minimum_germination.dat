In the present study, the effect of high temperatures and exposure times on germination of Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia) was analyzed in order to reveal the response of seeds to fire and the implications on species regeneration. Seeds were heated {{to a range of}} temperatures (from 75 to 170 ºC) and exposure times (from 30 seconds to 30 minutes) similar to those obtained in surface soil layers during natural fires. In total, twenty treatments were performed. Seed germination percentages and germination values were calculated for each treatment. The results of ANOVA performed for germination values showed that temperature had a significant effect. Germination percentages increased in thermal treatments at 70 ºC for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min; at 105 ºC for 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, and at 130 ºC for 1 and 2 min.

To ascertain what will be the allelopathic action of plant parts and rhizospheric soils of parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) growing at various farm locations with varied growing conditions, germination and seedling growth of maize hybrid (DK 6142) were assayed by sowing its seeds in petri plates lined with filter paper and pots filled with soil. <b>Minimum</b> <b>germination</b> percentage (30. 0 %), germination index (2. 01), germination energy (36. 3), seedling length (3. 3 cm), seedling biomass (10 mg) and seedling vigor index (99. 0) of maize were observed in leaf extract followed by fruit and whole plant extracts of parthenium growing near the field border. Rhizospheric soil collected underneath parthenium growing near a water channel caused maximum reductions in germination index (30. 8 %), germination energy (40. 6 %), seedling length (32. 6 %), seedling biomass (35. 1 %) and seedling vigor index (34. 3 %) of maize compared with that soil without any vegetation. Phytotoxic inhibitory effects of both parthenium plant and rhizospheric soil were more pronounced on maize root than its shoot growth. The higher suppressive action against germination and seedling growth of maize was probably due to higher total phenolic concentrations (6678. 2 and 2549. 0 mg L- 1) and presence of phenolic compounds viz., gallic, caffeic, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy benzoic, p-coumaric and m-coumaric acids; and ferulic, vanillic, syringic and m-coumaric acids in aqueous leaf extract of parthenium uprooted near the field border and its rhizospheric soil collected near a water channel, respectively...|$|E

In the laboratory, the effects were tested on germination rates at constant (9. 1 - 21. 8 degrees C) and diurnally fluctuating temperatures at different soil water potentials. Linear, 010, expolinear and quadratic models were fitted to the data on rate of emergence against temperature. For model validation, field emergence was monitored in 11 sowings conducted in 2001 - 2004. Emergence rate increased with temperature and was relatively high at soil water potentials in the range of - 0. 21 MPa to - 2. 6 x 10 (- 3) MPa, but was almost zero at - 0. 96 MPa and - 1. 8 X 10 (- 3) MPa. Diurnal temperature fluctuations did not have a differing influence on germination rates or final germination percentages compared with constant temperatures. The expolinear and the quadratic models were most accurate in explaining variation of laboratory data, especially at temperatures close to the <b>minimum</b> <b>germination</b> temperature of S. sisymbriffolium. These two models had root mean square errors for predicting field emergence rates (5. 9 to 38. 4 d) of 0. 81 and 0. 87 d, respectively, and were considered more appropriate to predict the time to 50 % germination for crops grown in conditions near their 'base temperature' than the widely used linear temperature (thermal time) models.

In order to assess, inter- and intra-specific variation for salt tolerance in radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and turnip(Brassica rapa L.), local cultivars of these two species were screened at varying levels of salinity stress (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 mM) at the germination and seedling stages. Increasing level of salinity caused a marked reduction in germination percentage and fresh and dry biomass of the seedlings of all cultivars of both species. Both species displayed highly significant intra-specific variation in seed germination and seedling growth at higher levels of salt. However, the degrees of salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stage varied in both species.

(Lamiaceae family) as well as comparing species regarding germination behavior and growth characteristics. Seeds were germinated on a temperature-gradient bar varying between 5 and 40 °C (with 5 °C intervals). Results indicated that the highest germination percentage of hyssop (92 - 98 %), sweet basil (86 - 90 %) and oregano (74 - 77 %) occurred at 20 - 30 °C, 25 - 30 °C and 20 - 30 °C, respectively; therefore, moderate and warm temperatures are proper for germination of all species. In all species the maximum germination rate obtained at 30 °C. Among all species, Day 10 % of Sweet basil Germination had the lowest value, which indicates faster germination. The cardinal temperatures (base, optimum and ceiling or maximum) were estimated by the segmented model. Base temperature (Tb) was calculated for hyssop, sweet basil and oregano as 3. 42, 5. 70 and 5. 46 °C, respectively. Optimal temperature (To) calculated for all species was approximately 30 °C, So warmer temperatures are much more proper for them.

The hypothesis was tested that an elevated gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) of membranes is responsible for this storage behaviour. To this end a spin probe technique, Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used. The in situ Tm of hydrated membranes was between 10 °C and 15 °C, coinciding with the critical <b>minimum</b> temperature for <b>germination.</b> During storage, viability of fresh embryos was lost within two weeks at 5 °C, but remained high at 25 °C. The loss of viability coincided with an increased leakage of K from the embryos upon imbibition and with an increased proportion of cells with injured plasma membranes. Freeze–fracture replicas of plasma membranes from chilled, hydrated axes showed lateral phase separation and signs of the inverted hexagonal phase. Dehydrated embryos were sensitive to soaking in water, particularly at low temperatures, but fresh embryos were not. After soaking dry embryos at 5 °C (4 h) plus 1 d of further incubation at 25 °C, the axis cells were structurally disorganized and did not become turgid. In contrast, cells had a healthy appearance and were turgid after soaking at 35 °C. Imbibitional stress {{was associated with the}} loss of plasma membrane integrity in a limited number of cells, which expanded during further incubation of the embryos at 25 °C. It is suggested that the injuries brought about by storage or imbibition at sub-optimal temperatures in tropical seeds whose membranes have a high intrinsic Tm (10 – 15 °C), are caused by gel phase formation...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii {{undergoes}} characteristic morphological {{changes during}} its annual population development. Primary filaments (those that derive {{directly from the}} akinetes) possess the following morphological features: the trichomes {{have one or two}} acuminate ends; they are narrower (2. 4 - 2. 6 mum) than older filaments, their lengths vary in a wide range (from 40 to 300 mum); some of them are straight but others are slightly coiled even in populations that later consist exclusively of straight filaments; cell walls between the cells are not or only hardly visible; the filaments have a fine granulation but no gas-vacuoles, polyphosphate- or any other contrasting bodies are seen. The secondary filaments deriving from the first division of primary filaments are similar but with only one acuminate end. This way, the number of germinating akinetes can be estimated as the number of primary filaments + 1 / 2 number of secondary filaments. The described morphological method to estimate inoculum size of C. raciborskii has limitations. (1) The number of akinetes that we get in this way is only a <b>minimum</b> number since <b>germination</b> is not synchronous under field conditions and probably not each akinete germinates that is present in the sediments. (2) The method is applicable only if germination occurs suddenly (relatively synchronously). This is often the case in a temperate region where germination is triggered by temperature. (3) The method cannot be used in tropical or subtropical lakes where water temperature is permanently rather high and akinetes do not develop or develop only very rarely. (4) Being an a posteriori method it cannot be used as predictive tool. Estimations for Lake Balaton are in a good agreement with results of studies with other methods (germination in laboratory cultures and direct counting) and have the advantage that they do not need time-consuming experimenting or difficult direct countings...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenology}} of Deginia velebitica seeds, {{including such}} topics as maturation, dispersal and germination times, is still largely unknown. For {{the purpose of the}} present research, the seeds were collected in the Botanical Garden, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb and in the natural habitat (above Sibinj, Veliki vrh, Velika kapela mountain) at the time of natural dispersal. Freshly matured and collected seeds were placed under natural conditions (16 – 28 °C), at room temperature (24 °C), 21 °C and in greenhouse conditions (22 / 31 °C). Some of the seeds were placed at 5 °C for 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks and checked to see if cold stratification was needed. The most interesting part for the study of germination phenology was the exposure of the seeds to temperature conditions similar to those in nature (in the garden) and the definition of maximum and <b>minimum</b> temperatures of <b>germination.</b> Seed dispersal begins soon after maturation and all seeds (100 %) are dispersed in one season. After 28 days, low percentages of germination, of 8. 77 % (at 24 °C), 6. 66 % (at 21 °C), 14. 55 % (at 22 – 31 °C) and 0 % (at 16 – 28 °C) were found, indicating non-deep physiological dormancy (PD) in Degenia seeds. Non-deep PD is broken by cold stratification and by seeds being stored dry at room temperature (afterripening). The highest percentage of germination was at 22 – 31 °C, and the lowest at 21 °C indicating that Degenia velebitica germinates in late summer or early autumn. Seeds do not require light for germination, but germination in the light is 54 % better at 22 – 31 °C, 35 % at room temperature and 7 % better at 16 – 28 °C than in the dark.

The {{study was conducted to}} assess the quality of seed used by farmers from different sources and regions. A total of 304 wheat (Trticium aestivum L. and T. durum L.) seed samples from Ethiopia and 206 wheat and 200 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seed samples from Syria were collected from major wheat and barley growing regions to investigate the quality of seed obtained from various sources and regions and planted by farmers. A 1 kg sample was drawn from seed lots intended for planting from each farmer. A detailed questionnaire was used to collect information on seed selection and management practices and farmers' perception of seed quality. The physical and physiological quality of seed samples was analyzed using standard testing procedures. In Ethiopia, the mean physical purity and germination of wheat seed was 98. 92 % and 96 %, respectively, and the majority of samples (93 %; n = 303) met the <b>minimum</b> purity and <b>germination</b> standards for certified seed 2. Certified seed from the formal sector seed had the highest analytical purity (99. 4 %), but this was not significantly different from other seed sources, such as neighbors/other farmers (98. 8 %), local traders/markets (98. 6 %), or own saved seed (98. 9 %). However, the mean germination for certified seed (96 %) showed a weak significant difference from seed obtained from other sources (94 %). In Syria, mean physical purity and germination for wheat was 97. 6 % and 88 %, respectively, and for barley 95. 5 % and 86 %, respectively. Seed quality was better in wheat than in barley. The majority of wheat seed samples, i. e., 70. 4 % (n = 206) for physical purity and 78. 2 % for <b>germination,</b> met the <b>minimum</b> seed quality requirements of certified seed 2. In barley, only 10 % of samples for physical purity and 72 % of samples for germination met this standard. Contamination with weed seeds appeared to be the major constraint for seed samples not meeting the standard of formal sector. There {{was no significant difference in}} physical and physiological quality of wheat seed samples obtained from different sources. In barley, germination from different sources was significantly different. Highly significant differences in seed quality were observed for seed samples collected from different regions and districts for wheat and barley crops in both countries. Vigor indices showed significant differences among wheat and barley seed samples from different regions and districts, but not among different sources. Simple correlation coefficients showed significant relationships among vigor tests. The standard germination, speed of germination, and seedling root length were well correlated with field emergence in wheat and barley in both countries. Farmers used local seed management practices, such as seed selection, cleaning, treatment, or separate storage to improve or maintain seed quality. A large number of seed samples managed differently by farmers met the minimum physical purity and germination standard for certified seed 2, producing seed comparable to those from the formal sector.

40|$|Background: This study {{seeks to}} model {{aspects of the}} {{regeneration}} of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) seedlings under a range of environmental conditions. This study investigated whether “hybrid” mechanistic models, which predict plant growth and development using empirical representations of plant physiological responses to the environment, could provide a realistic alternative to conventional empirical regeneration models. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) identify the functional relationships between the environmental conditions controlling germination, establishment and growth of radiata pine seedlings, under a range of those environmental conditions as specified by temperature and available light and soil water; and 2) specify those functional relationships in hybrid mechanistic (“hybrid”) models. Methods: Radiata pine seedling germination and growth were measured under controlled environmental conditions (incubators for seed germination, growth cabinets for seedlings), and results used to adapt, parameterise and test two published hybrid models; one for germination (the hydrothermal time model); and one for seedling growth {{in the first six months}} after germination, based on plant radiation use efficiency (RUE). The hydrothermal model was tested by incubating commercial radiata pine seeds under factorial combinations of temperature and water potentials where germination was likely to occur (12. 5 ºC to 32. 5 ºC and 0 MPa to – 1. 2 MPa.). 100 seeds were germinated for each factorial combination. The hydrothermal germination model was fitted to the germination data using non-linear regression modles, will allowed simultaneous estimation of all modle parameters. Seedlings were grown in controlled growth cabinets, and their RUE was calculated as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, specified in terms of an increase in oven dry biomass), to PAR intercepted or absorbed by a seedling. Estimation of seedling RUE required development of novel techniques for non-destructive estimation of seedling oven dry weight, and measurement of PAR interception by seedlings. The effect of varying PAR flux density on RUE was tested by measuring RUE of seedlings grown at 125, 250 and 500 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹. In a second experiment, the effect of deficits in available soil water on RUE was tested by measuring RUE of seedlings grown under 250 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PAR flux, and at different levels of available soil water. Available soil water was specified by a soil moisture modifier factor (ƒθ) which ranges between 1 for moist soils and 0 for soils where there is insufficient water for seedling growth. This soil moisture modifier had not previously been applied in studies of tree seedling growth. Temperatures for both seedling experiments were a constant 17. 5 ºC (day) and 12. 5 ºC (night). Results: Hydrothermal time models accurately described radiata pine seed germination. Model predictions were closely correlated with actual seed germination over the full range of temperature and water potentials where germination was likely to occur (12. 5 ºC to 32. 5 ºC and 0 MPa to – 1. 2 MPa. The <b>minimum</b> temperature for <b>germination</b> (base temperature) was 9. 0 ºC. Optimum temperatures for germination ranged from ~ 20 ºC for slow-germinating seeds to ~ 27 ºC for the fastest germinating seeds. The minimum water potential for seed germination varied within the seed population, with an approximately normal distribution (base water potential = – 1. 38 MPa, standard deviation of 0. 48 MPa). In the process of developing the model, a novel explanation for the decline in germination rates at supra-optimal temperatures was developed (Section 3. 4. 6), based on earlier models proposed by Alvarado & Bradford (2002) and Rowse & Finch-Savage (2003). This explanation was that the decline in germination rate was not driven just by temperature, but by accumulated hydrothermal time above the base temperature for germination (T₀). This in turn raised the base soil water potential (Ψb) towards 0, so that the reduction in germination rate arose from a reduced accumulation of hydro-time, rather than from thermal denaturation of enzymes facilitating germination – the conventional explanation for non-linear accumulation of thermal time at supra-optimal temperatures for plant development. Upwards adjustment (towards 0 MPa) of base water potentials of germinating seeds occurred also at very cold temperatures in combination with high water potentials. In both cases (very cold or else supra-optimal temperatures) this upwards adjustment in base water potentials prevented germination of part of the seed population, and is proposed as a mechanism which enables seed populations to “hedge their bets” when germinating under less than ideal germination conditions. RUE of young germinated radiata pine seedlings growing in a controlled growth cabinet was not significantly different over a range of constant PAR flux densities. Mean RUE’s were 3. 22, 2. 82 and 2. 58 g MJ⁻¹ at 125, 250 and 500 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ respectively. In the second experiment, the novel use of a soil moisture modifier (ƒθ) to predict RUE of seedlings subjected to water stress proved successful within a limited range of soil water stress conditions. Measured seedling transpiration and stomatal conductance were closely correlated but seedling photosynthesis was less correlated with available soil water. This result suggests that photosynthesis was not coupled with stomatal conductance when PAR flux was 250 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, which is well below saturating irradiance for C₃ plants. Conclusions: The use of hybrid, quasi-mechanistic models to describe tree seedling growth has been seldom explored, which necessitated the development of novel experimental and analytical techniques for this study. These included a predictive model of germination decline at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures; a method for accurately estimating seedling dry weights under a range of PAR flux densities; and a novel method for estimating light interception by small seedlings. The work reported in this thesis showed that existing hybrid models (the hydrothermal time germination model and the RUE model) can be adapted to model germination and growth of radiata pine seedlings under controlled environmental conditions. Nonetheless, further research is needed before the models can be confidently used as an alternative to conventional empirical models to model regeneration in “real-world” forests. Research priorities are the performance of hydrothermal germination models under variable field conditions, and the use of the soil moisture modifier for seedlings growing on a range of soil textures and under a range of PAR fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Land {{managers}} {{increasingly are}} {{being involved in}} making quantitative evaluation of management options. Forests, however, are complex biological systems and predictions require the synthesis of many processes. Traditional approaches to evaluating options have been to replicate experiments in time and space. Not all questions are amenable to such approaches, and even where they are, inferences may be of only limited application. In an increasingly complex decision making context, land managers will require access to more sophisticated techniques. This thesis illustrates the collection of basic data, its synthesis into a physiological model, and its use {{as a tool to}} address a typically complex management question - the time at which Eucalyptus delegatensis R. T. Baker seed should be sown in forest regeneration operations. The species is widely exploited for commercial forestry in South-Eastern Australia and its germination physiology is moderately complex, providing an appropriate test for the usefulness of the modelling approach. The germination response of seedlots from five provenances to temperature, stratification, soil matric potential and interrupted imbibition was examined. The species was found to have a distinct temperature optimum between 15 and 20 °C, and a <b>minimum</b> temperature for <b>germination</b> of approximately 2 °C. Short periods of exposure to high temperatures did not substantially affect germination performance. Stratification greatly increased the range of temperatures over which a high proportion of the seed germinated. Increases in the rate of germination with stratification are related to accrued thermal time during stratification. Pre-imbibing seeds at water potentials down to - 2 MPa increased the rate of germination. However, no advantage was found after pre-imibibing at lesser soil water matric potentials. This increased germination rate was associated with a shortening of the time to commencement of germination and more synchronous germination. Germination rate and germination capacity were impeded by soil matric potentials below - 0. 01. MPa, and germination was totally inhibited by soil matric potentials below - 0. 5 MPa. Soil matric potential and temperature interacted in their effects on germination capacity, and seeds germinating at near optimum temperatures were less sensitive to soil moisture stress. Seeds survived dehydration within sixty hours of the commencement of imbibition, but were increasingly affected by dehydration thereafter. The rate of imbibition was influenced by the ambient temperature and solution water potential. At modest levels of water stress imbibition was not impeded and the observed reduction in gennination capacity was probably due to the inhibition of ii growth related processes. Differences in germination response were detected between the seedlots and these could be related to their geographic brigin. The proportion of variability in seed and germination traits attributable to interand intra-site components varied between traits examined. The germination rate of seed was not significantly different between trees within a site, or between trees from different sites. Variation in seed size and the proportion of dormant seed in seed samples was mainly affected by site effects. The sensitivity of seed samples to the water stress levels applied also varied substantially between sites but additionally the seed from the drier site exhibited a highly significant between-tree variability. It was concluded that the proportion of variation in seed and germination characteristics attributable to between-, and to within-site effects, could be partly related to the scale at which selective forces were presumed to operate. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of variation in response existed within the seed collected from the one tree. The role of age and microtopographical variation in enabling seedlings to withstand frost and drought was explored in glasshouse studies. The frost resistance of E. delegatensis was found to vary with seedling age over {{the first six months of}} development. Much of this variation was found to be a result of the differing sensitivity of leaves originating from different leaf nodes, although older leaves from the same node may have been more frost resistant than recently expanded leaves. Newly emergent seedlings appeared to be the most susceptible stage of the tree's lifecycle to death by frost. Small scale variation in soil conditions, at the scale of tens of centimetres, markedly affected the germination and establishment of seeds and seedlings under moisture limiting conditions. Microsites that afforded protection, and probably resulted in increased humidity, caused a marked increase in germination number and rate. The mean survival time was significantly higher on these protected microsites than on less protected microsites, or on microsites that restricted root penetration. The importance of this variability in microtopography was strongly influenced by season and the level of environmental stress, and was diminished as seedlings aged. Due to the different requirements for seed germination and seedling growth, a favourable microsite for germination was not necessarily a favourable site for seedling survival. A comparison of seed and seedling responses to water stress indicated that for E. delegatensis, at least, selection due to microsite differences at the time of germination may not affect the developmental characteristics of the seedlings. iii At two geographically close sites that differed significantly in climatic profile, seed of E. delegatensis and Eucalyptus amygdalina Labill., a species that frequently replaces E. delegatensis on drier sites, was sown at twelve times of the year. Regular censuses of seedlings were conducted. The pattern of survival of over twenty thousand seedlings, comprising one thousand two hundred identified cohorts was followed. The influences of weather, seed harvesting, site preparation, time of emergence and time of sowing on emergence, growth and survival were examined. By modelling temperature and soil moisture it was found that germination in the field was influenced strongly by ambient temperature and soil moisture and that the commencement of germination flushes in spring and autumn were well correlated to threshold values of soil moisture and air temperature predicted from laboratory studies. A model of seasonal patterns of seedling mortality was developed and concluded to be highly age dependant. Although age dependant mortality rate was relatively constant at a given site between seasons and years, with each season containing its own compliment of hazards, it was necessary to make allowance for stochastic events, such as severe frosts and drought, to satisfactorily model survivorship. A mathematical model of germination was developed for E. delegatensis based on the physiology of underlying processes. The accuracy of this model in predicting the time course of germination under conditions of fluctuating temperature and moisture was examined. This model was used to examine the results from the field trial. In combination with a mortality function derived from field observation, this gennination model was used to make recommendations on the optimum times of sowing for the east coast of Tasmania, to explore the importance of 'safe sites' for germination, and to investigate the implications of different seedlot dormancy responses on reproductive success...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Wheat, Triticum spp., Barley, Hordeum vulgare L., Seed Systems, Formal Seed Sector, Informal Seed Sector, National Seed Program, Seed Source, Seed Selection, Seed Management, Seed Quality, Genetic Diversity, Ethiopia, Syria In Ethiopia and Syria, {{wheat and}} barley {{are the two}} most {{important}} principal cereal crops grown since ancient times. Many generations of natural and human selection led into highly adapted and diverse populations of local landraces. For most of the history of agriculture, plant improvement and seed selection were farmer-based activities carried out {{as an integral part of}} crop production. W ith the development of commercial agriculture, plant breeding and seed production evolved into different disciplines. The wheat and barley seed systems were studied in Ethiopia and Syria to obtain an insight into the functioning of formal and informal seed systems with emphasis on understanding: the flow of information on new agricultural technologies; farmers' perception, criteria and adoption of modern varieties; farmers' seed sources and indigenous knowledge in seed management practices; quality of seed planted by farmers and its constraints; and   on -farm wheat and barley diversity. Farmers use multiple sources of information such as the formal (extension services, development agencies, research institutions, media broadcast) or the informal (own experience, relatives, neighbors, other farmers, local traders) sources to acquire knowledge on varieties and/or agronomic packages for crop production. M ost wheat growers (over 90 %) are aware of and have information on modern varieties, agrochemical inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, etc.) and agronomic packages. In Ethiopia, the formal extension service was the main source of information for new technologies generated by research through its recently introduced agricultural package program, comparatively more so than in Syria where fellow farmers (relatives, neighbors and other farmers) accounted as the major source of information. Neighbors and other farmers were the second most important informal sources of information particularly for modern varieties partly due to the lateral varietal diffusion through traditional seed exchanges. Farmers grow three broad categories of wheat varieties, i. e. recommended, 'obsolete' or landraces. An extensive use of modern wheat varieties and production packages was found among wheat growers in both countries. In Ethiopia, the majority of farmers grew modern bread wheat varieties (76 % recommended and 10 % obsolete varieties), and applied fertilizers (96. 7 %) and herbicides (63. 5 %) to their wheat crop. Similarly, wheat farmers in Syria used modern varieties on the recommended list (97 %), fertilizers (99. 5 %), herbicides (92. 7 %), storage pesticides (40. 8 %), and seed treatment chemicals (90. 3 %). However, the use of modern varieties and associated technologies was negligible for barley growers in Syria except for the use of fertilizers (56 %). Although seven modern barley varieties were released none of them were widely adopted because of farmers' preferences or lack of varietal adaptability. The entire barley area (99 %) was planted with a local landrace Arabi Aswad in northeastern Syria. Developing crop varieties with high yield and yield stability for agroecologically diverse durum wheat growing environments in Ethiopia or agro-climatically variable marginal environments typical to barley production areas in northeastern Syria still remains a challenging task. About 26 technological and socio-economic criteria were identified by farmers for adopting new modern wheat and barley varieties or for evaluating those currently grown on their farm. Grain yield, grain color, grain size, marketability and food quality (feed quality for barley), appeared most important in both crops and transcended all regions. Ethiopian farmers also consider tolerance to pests very important given their awareness of the susceptibility of the existing wheat varieties to major rust diseases. In Syria, non-lodging, frost tolerance or drought tolerance are additional agronomic characteristics farmers seeking from new wheat varieties. Some wheat local landraces were highly preferred by farmers because of their unique adaptation to diverse agroecological zones, stable yield, grain quality, marketability and for traditional food preparation. Most farmers in Syria had positive perceptions of the barley local landrace where one third saw no disadvantage in growing it. Farmers' seed acquisition from external sources is dynamic reflecting their response to specific technical and socio-economic factors associated with farming. Farmers used four main sources of seed for planting: (a) own saved seed from the previous years' harvest; (b) seed obtained from relatives, neighbors or other farmers; (c) seed purchased through local markets or grain traders; and (d) seed purchased from the formal sector. The informal farmer-to-farmer seed exchange is the major initial source of wheat and barley varieties as well as for seed used for planting each year. In Ethiopia, the informal sector accounted as an initial source of modern varieties for 58 % of the wheat farmers and as a source of seed for planting for 92 % of farmers in 1997 / 98 crop season. In Syria the formal sector was the main initial seed source of modern wheat varieties where it accounted for nearly 60 %, but provided wheat seed for only 24 % among sample farmers in 1998 / 99 crop season. Almost all barley farmers (87 %) as expected initially sourced their current seed stock from informal sources (relatives, other farmers, neighbors or local markets). Farmers had a positive perception of seed both from formal and informal sources and were generally satisfied with the quality of seed obtained from different sources. Farmers purchase seed from the formal sector because of likely perception of high physical purity, chemical treatment, or as a strategy to acquire new varieties. Moreover, most farmers were also satisfied with the quality of own saved seed or that obtained from other informal sources due to its timely availability, less or no transaction costs or lack of credit facilities, adaptable varieties and certified seed. Farmers' perception of seed influenced them to practise different on-farm seed management approaches to maintain the quality of their wheat and barley seed through selection (46 - 67 %), cleaning (83 - 90 %), treatment (4 - 90 %), separate storage (64 - 76 %) or informal assessment of physiological quality (3 - 34 %). Almost all wheat and barley growers recognized the difference between grain and seed and attributed these to physical purity, absence of weeds, big kernel size, good germination, free of insect damage. The responsibility for on-farm seed management was shared between men and women, who had a distinctive role to play. In Ethiopia, the mean physical purity and germination of wheat seed was 98. 92 and 96 %, respectively and the majority of samples reached the <b>minimum</b> purity and <b>germination</b> standards. In Syria, mean physical purity and germination for wheat was 97. 59 % and 86 %, respectively whereas for barley the average analytical purity was 95. 47 % and germination was 86 %. However, the quality of wheat seed samples was higher than that of barley seed samples where most of the samples (90 and 28 % for purity and germination, respectively) failed to meet the minimum official seed standards. Highly significant differences in seed quality were observed for seed samples collected from different regions and districts for wheat and barley crops in both countries. However, there was limited significant difference in physiological quality of seed samples obtained from different sources, but not in physical quality. Several seed-borne fungi such as Drechslera sativum, Septoria nodorum and Fusarium graminearum, F. poae, F. avenaceum, and F. nivale including storage fungi were recorded across samples from different wheat growing region of Ethiopia. Among fungal pathogens isolated from wheat seed, 83. 6 % of samples were infected with D. sativum (average infection rate of 1. 85 %) and 74 % of the samples with Fusarium graminearum (average infection rate of 1. 54 %). Infection with loose smut (Ustilago tritici), common bunt (Tilletia spp.) and seed gall nematode (Anguina tritici) was low where only 11. 2, 2. 3 and 8. 6 % of the samples were infected, respectively. In Syria, 68 and 14 % of wheat seed samples were infected with common bunt and loose smut, respectively. The average loose smut infection was 0. 8 %. The majority of barley seed samples were also infected with covered smut (Ustilago hordei = 85 %) and loose smut (83 %) in varying proportion. The average loose smut infection for barley was 18 %. Seed health quality of wheat was better than of barley in terms of the frequency (number of samples) and intensity of infection (% infection). On-farm varietal diversity in terms of the number of varieties/landraces grown and area coverage were quite low both for wheat and barley. Farm level surveys showed low spatial diversity where few dominant wheat varieties occupy a large proportion of area. These few wheat varieties were also grown by the majority of farmers threatening the diversity of local landraces. In Ethiopia, the five top wheat varieties were grown by 56 % of the sample farmers and these varieties were planted on 80 % of the total wheat area whereas for Syria it was 78 and 81 %, respectively in the same order. In case of barley one single local landrace was grown in the entire survey area. The weighted average age of wheat varieties was 13. 8 years for bread wheat in Ethiopia and 10. 8 years for wheat in Syria showing low varietal replacement by farmers, an indicator of low temporal diversity. The coefficient of parentage analysis showed that the average and weighted diversity for bread wheat was 0. 76 and 0. 66, respectively in Ethiopia and for bread wheat (0. 73 / 0. 42) and durum wheat (0. 85 / 0. 73) in Syria. The field experiments showed significant variations for desirable agronomic and phenotypic traits diversity such as plant height, grain yield, and yield components (spike length, spikelets spike - 1, kernels per spike - 1, seed weight) among wheat and barley varieties and/or local landraces. This study combined farmer surveys, laboratory analysis and field experiments to better understand farmer's perception and adoption of modern varieties (and associated technologies) and to investigate on-farm genetic diversity and seed quality suggesting alternative ways for improving and strengthening the national seed system. Moreover, the study used extensive secondary data to draw a synthesis on the future direction of the national seed sector in developing countries in general and of the Ethiopian and Syrian seed industry in particular. </span...|$|R
40|$| {{based on}} the {{assumption}} that soil particles can be considered as spheroids gave poor results, possibly because of a wrong choice of the depolarization factor. Measurements of thermal conductivity in the laboratory with the transient needle method yielded good results for sandy loam. For the shrinking and swelling clay, however, a large scatter in the data occurred because of change in dry bulk density which could hardly be corrected for. Therefore preference was given to measure thermal conductivity in the soil in situ. Thermal diffusivity of the sandy loam could be deduced from laboratory data. Determination of thermal diffusivity in the field from the analysis of temperature measurements at various depths, by considering the amplitude and phase relationships with depth, failed, indicating that the thermal properties did vary with depth. To establish functional relationships of thermal diffusivity with depth, an electric analog as well as a numerical approach, both {{based on the}} principle that a discontinuous field can approach the continuous thermal field by expanding the partial differential equation into a set of finite difference equations, was used. The scatter in the data obtained with the electric analog method was large due to various reasons like for example recording and reading errors from the temperature recorders, relatively widely spaced temperature observations at the larger depths and heterogeneity of the soils. With the numerical approach also disappointing results were obtained. Improvement of recording and reading errors by replacing measured temperature data by reconstructed smoothed temperatures computed from Fourier analysis, did not give better results. Improvement of the error inherent in discretizing the continuous temperature field to a discontinuous field by application of interpolation by means of spline functions, neither did. From extensive calculations on a possible disturbing influence of water transport in the vapour phase as induced by thermal gradients, it could be shown that this process could be neglected as a possible explanation of the scatter in the thermal diffusivity data. The best method to determine thermal diffusivity proved to be deriving thermal capacity from soil sample data, measuring thermal conductivity with the transient needle method in situ, and estimating thermal diffusivity at each depth by considering the ratio of thermal conductivity and capacity. It was found that at higher groundwater levels thermal diffusivity is generally lower, especially in the top 0. 10 to 0. 15 m layer, indicating lower soil temperatures at higher groundwater levels. From temperature measurements it appeared that the mean daily temperatures of the plots with the higher groundwater tables were 1 to 2 °C lower than the temperature of the plots with the deeper groundwater tables. With the same groundwater depth, clay proved to be warmer than sandy loam. It could be concluded that on the investigated soils the difference in groundwater level was playing a more important role than the difference in type of profile. The maxima and minima in the top soil were higher and the amplitudes decreased with depth faster in soils which had a deep groundwater table. The decrease was more marked in the clay than in the sandy loam soil. In Chapter V the combined effects of water and heat on seedling emergence and crop production were treated. In the stage of germination and seedling emergence, the soil moisture content and soil temperature are the most important factors. In the stage from seedling emergence to maturity growth depends also on air temperature, but mainly on leaf area and net radiation. The known effects of soil temperature and soil moisture content on germination and seedling emergence were reviewed. To relate temperature and emergence the heat sum concept was used. This approach is in practice frequently applied to schedule plantings, to predict maturity, to select crop varieties appropriate to different areas, etc. In such type of studies mostly the environmental air temperature is used. In the case of emergence of seeds it is advisable, however, to register the temperature in the direct environment of the seed, c. q. to measure soil temperature at sowing depth. The results of investigations on the influence of soil moisture content on germination and emergence as reported from laboratory experiments in literature, generally differ widely, mainly because of differences in applied experimental conditions as for example the use of a solution instead of soil as a germination medium. The combined effect of soil temperature and moisture content on seedling emergence was studied with four different kinds of vegetable seeds in field experiments in a clay and a sandy loam profile, both with a shallow and a deep groundwater table. Various sowing dates were applied. It appeared that emergence was highly correlated with rainfall, and that because of the favourable hydrological properties of the soil seeds emerged earlier in sandy loam than in clay. It was found that on all sowing dates the sandy loam plots with the shallow groundwater table showed the highest emergence rate as well as the highest total emergence percentage. The mean heat sums required for 50 % emergence were lower on sandy loam than on clay, and the heat sums of the shallow groundwater plots were lower than those of the deep groundwater plots. The minimum temperatures for emergence of the various seeds were calculated using only those treatments in which no limitation of water could be expected. The effect of soil moisture on emergence could be evaluated by calculating the heat sums of all treatments, taking into account the minimum temperature for emergence. As indicator for the minimum moisture content required for emergence, the first five days after sowing were used, for which the average soil moisture content was calculated from sampling data and precipitation records. It was found that the heat sum required for 50 % emergence increased sharply below a matric pressure of - 0. 49 bar (above pF 2. 7) of the soil. Laboratory experiments with radish seed under controlled soil moisture and temperature conditions confirmed the results obtained from the field experiments that - 0. 49 bar (pF 2. 7) is the critical value for emergence as regards the dry side. From laboratory experiments it could be shown that - 0. 098 bar (pF 2. 0) is the critical value for emergence as regards the wet side. The time needed for emergence increases rapidly at matric pressure above - 0. 098 bar and below - 0. 49 bar. It appeared from these experiments that heat sums can give a relatively accurate prediction for emergence, if soil moisture content is taken into account. For a fast and adequate seedling emergence both a high temperature and a sufficient moisture content are necessary. Under field conditions this combination is seldom reached because higher soil temperatures are generally related with lower moisture contents and deeper groundwater tables. To get out of this dilemma one can maintain a relatively deep groundwater table, which gives a relatively high temperature, and keep by means of sprinkler irrigation the sowing bed at the desired moisture content. This offers the additional advantage of keeping the temperature of the seed bed low in periods when soil temperature would exceed the optimum temperature for germination and emergence. It is to be noted that temperatures of 40 °C and higher (which are far too high for germination and emergence of various seeds) in the top layer of clay soils in the Netherlands in mid summer are no exception. From literature it is known that yields of spring crops decrease when sowing dates are later and that owing to adequate drainage, soils can be cultivated and sown approximately 5 to 14 days earlier. An additional advantage of drainage is the shortening of the germination and emergence period as a result of the higher soil temperatures. From calculations it was shown that due to drainage sometimes a 10 -day gain in emergence can be obtained as compared with a shallowly drained soil. The effect of drainage (or any other measure) on seedling emergence will be the largest when soil temperatures in the range close to the <b>minimum</b> temperature for <b>germination</b> and emergence are increased. If available water is limiting, plant production will be reduced, which especially holds true for vegetable crop production where production is more aimed at quality and fresh weight than at an increase in dry matter. To weigh the influence of various measures, as for instance change in groundwater table depth or soil profile, on the production of crops, potential (gross) production rates which could have been obtained under the prevailing weather conditions with an optimum water and nutrient supply were calculated for the crops red cabbage, dwarf French beans and celery. Taking into account effects of soil cover and diffusion resistances of the crop, maximum production rates for the prevailing environmental conditions were computed. These rates were compared with the dry matter production rates obtained from periodical harvests. The relationships between real and calculated production rates were analyzed by linear regression of measured on calculated production, from which reduction factors (α ph) were derived. From various data reported in literature it appears that losses in dry matter production by respiratory processes is about 30 per cent, so that maximum dry matter production is about 0. 7 (= α ph) of the potential production. For dwarf French beans an average α ph of 0. 67 was found for the various objects, indicating that the environmental conditions were fairly optimum. For red cabbage rather low α ph values were found: 0. 51 to 0. 56 for clay and clay on sandy loam respectively and 0. 40 for sandy loam. The main reason for these low α ph values seemed to be nitrogen deficiency. This deficiency occurred mainly in dry periods on the clay profiles and in wet periods (in autumn) on the sandy loam profiles. Moreover air deficiency induced by heavy rains in the later stages of growth may have been of importance. For celery also a low average α ph of 0. 52 for the various objects was obtained, again mainly because of nitrogen deficiency. Part of the discrepancy could be explained by the applied calculation procedure. A discussion on the various existing methods in determining the water use efficiency of a crop was presented. By considering total dry matter production and the ratio total evaporation over mean vapour pressure deficit of the three crops mentioned, it could be shown that the water use efficiency of dwarf French beans is highest, followed by celery and then red cabbage. It was found that under the prevailing environmental conditions other than water shortage, red cabbage on sandy loam was rather soon limited in its production. On the other profiles limitation of production did not set in. The influence of groundwater table depth on production of crops has always been widely investigated in the Netherlands, especially on groundwater level experimental fields. Because of changes in weather conditions the relationship between yield and groundwater level differs from year to year and it seems of little use to make this comparison for years on end. Because for a certain dry matter production a certain amount of water has to be evaporated, it is better to consider for a growing period the amount of water available for evaporation, partly determined by the amount of precipitation and partly by the amount of water that can b...|$|R
