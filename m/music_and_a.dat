5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, {{some aspects of the}} <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> weak and confusing plot.

5|$|Three albums {{have been}} released: the promotional Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Pre Soundtrack in July 2013, the Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack in November 2013, and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Soundtrack Plus in March 2014.

The main soundtrack, despite some tracks being critiqued, was generally praised as a good selection of <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fitting conclusion {{to the music of}} the Final Fantasy XIII series. It was also praised by reviewers of the game as a whole. The Soundtrack Plus album was reviewed less favorably. Both commercial albums sold well enough to be placed on the Oricon charts, with the Original Soundtrack reaching #29 and remaining on the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network. The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E
