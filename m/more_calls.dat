5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E
5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It {{is estimated that}} 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur {{as a result of}} poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{open letter}} was {{published}} in February 2009, and signed by more than 30 prominent Indians, including Justice Iyer, actor Aamir Khan, Maulana Khalid Rasheed, Swami Agnivesh, and many <b>more.</b> <b>Calls</b> {{for the release of}} imprisoned Baha'is have continued since that time, with many prominent Indians expressing their concern.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "session" [...] {{refers to}} a {{communication}} between two parties - {{in the context of}} telephony, this would be a call. Each call consists of one or <b>more</b> <b>call</b> signaling message exchanges that control the call, and one or <b>more</b> <b>call</b> media streams which carry the call's audio, video, or other data along with information of call statistics and quality. Together, these streams make up a session. It is the job of a session border controller to exert influence over the data flows of sessions.|$|R
25|$|Cramer's {{object is}} to {{showcase}} his encyclopedic knowledge of stocks and give callers a second opinion on their stock ideas. He takes as many calls as possible before a buzzer goes off to indicate {{the end of the}} round. When this happens, Cramer gets upset and usually takes a few <b>more</b> <b>calls.</b> After this, the Daktronics buzzer goes off at his signal, and the segment is over.|$|E

25|$|The first {{distress}} call {{had been made}} just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 04:39 pm and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 04:51 pm. None of the calls had gone through {{due to a lack}} of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over a second before breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 am and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false PIN code were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between the 7th and 10th of April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, the phone was turned on at 10:51 am, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56 am.|$|E

25|$|Australia was in {{difficulty}} at 5/79 when Miller came to bat, {{he struck}} a counterattacking 30, with seven fours, before being caught behind off the bowling of Trueman {{in his last}} innings at Lord's. Australia recovered from 6/115 at stumps to finish at 257 to set England 371 to win. He then removed Graveney for 18 {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson from a full toss. After lunch, he had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and completed his only ten-wicket match haul in Test. England had lost their last four wickets for 11 as Australia won by 185runs. Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match, and more than a third of the overs in the second innings. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Johnson gave him the next ten days away from cricket. Despite Australia's success, Miller's triumph and Johnson's effort in bowling only four overs and scoring 23, led to <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> for a change of captain.|$|E
500|$|<b>More</b> <b>calls</b> for {{constitutional}} reform came in 1996. President Lukashenko unilaterally established the referendum after the Supreme Soviet refused {{to support the}} measures or set up a date for the vote. An earlier attempt by the Supreme Soviet to establish their own referendum in September 1996 was struck down as [...] "inconsistent with the Constitution" [...] by the Constitutional Court. The referendum amended the Constitution mostly to strengthen {{the power of the}} presidency. Amongst the changes made were the following: ...|$|E

[...] The police discussed the [...] of Wood with a consultant psychiatrist {{on the same day}} due to the firearm confiscations and the phone calls. [...] The following day, Wood made three <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> to Tunney and threatened suicide in one of them; he claimed he killed because of [...] "love and desperation, not anger and hate".|$|E
500|$|Both schools {{sold their}} allotments of Music City Bowl tickets rapidly. Virginia Tech, which was {{attending}} its sixth consecutive bowl game, {{sold more than}} 9,000 tickets {{in the first week}} of sales. Alabama's tickets were primarily distributed to season-ticket holders. Of Alabama's 12,000 bowl tickets, 10,000 were reserved for season-ticket holders and only 2,000 were available for open purchase. These were sold on the first day of sales. By December 9, both Alabama and the game itself had sold their entire allotment of tickets. Virginia Tech had just 200 tickets remaining, and they were sold by the 10th. In an interview with a local newspaper, an official at the Virginia Tech ticket office indicated that demand for tickets was so great that [...] "We could have sold at least a couple thousand more. ... We were inundated for 3-4 days, and then, once Alabama was selected to play in the game, we got a lot <b>more</b> <b>calls,</b> and we were sold out." [...] Some fans were able to obtain tickets at the game via purchases from ticket scalpers.|$|E
500|$|Although often {{supported}} by South Korean politicians and newspaper editorials, the No Gun Ri survivors' repeated {{demands for a}} reopened U.S. investigation and compensation went unheeded. Meeting with South Korean officials in 2001, the survivors asked that their government seek action at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and in U.N. human rights forums, but were rebuffed. In 2002, a spokesman for South Korea's then-governing party called for a new U.S. inquiry, but the Defense Ministry later warned the National Assembly that a reopened probe might damage U.S.-South Korean relations. [...] The disclosure in 2006 that Pentagon investigators had omitted the Muccio letter from their final report, along with other incriminating documents and testimony, prompted <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> for action. Two leaders of the National Assembly appealed to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a joint investigation, but no U.S. congressional body ever took up the No Gun Ri issue. In a 2015 book, David Straub, U.S. Embassy political chief during the No Gun Ri investigation, wrote that meeting the survivors' demands would have set an undesirable precedent for similar cases from 1950 Korea. After a delegation's visit to No Gun Ri, the annual General Assembly of the US Presbyterian Church adopted a resolution in June 2016 calling on church leadership to urge the U.S. president and Congress to issue an apology and appropriate compensation for the No Gun Ri killings.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Soap's controversy, among {{liberals and}} conservatives alike, {{ironically}} actually helped to sell the series to the general public. Fueled by six months of pre-show protests (as well as a solid lead-in from the hit shows Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley and Three's Company), the first episode swept its time slot with a 25.6 rating and 39 percent share (39% of the national audience). Although ABC received hundreds of phone calls after the premiere, executives at the network described initial public reaction as [...] "mild" [...] with <b>more</b> <b>calls</b> {{in favor of the}} show than in protest. A University of Richmond poll found that 74% of viewers found Soap inoffensive, 26% found it offensive, and half of those who were offended said they planned to watch it the next week.|$|E
