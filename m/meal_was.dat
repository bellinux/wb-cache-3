5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|BK targets {{specific}} sub-groups {{within the}} adult market. Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due to perceived nudity concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Consider an {{arbitrary}} set of strategies by a player's opponent. Let {{the total cost}} of the other players' <b>meals</b> <b>be</b> x. The cost of ordering the cheap <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> [...] and the cost of ordering the expensive <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> [...] So the utilities for each <b>meal</b> <b>are</b> [...] for the expensive meal and [...] for the cheaper meal. By assumption, the utility of ordering the expensive <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> higher. Remember that the choice of opponents' strategies was arbitrary and that the situation is symmetric. This proves that the expensive <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> strictly dominant and thus the unique Nash equilibrium.|$|R

5|$|Lindow Man's last <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards, {{furious at}} {{the seizure of}} the gunboats and {{demanding}} they be returned. Malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin, while the boat's crew were imprisoned below decks. Shortly afterwards, at 16:00, Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and grog to the crew, {{the total number of}} Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200. Once the <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> finished, Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole, although he retained the captured gunboats.|$|E

5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E

50|$|Meals occur {{primarily}} at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur {{on a daily}} basis, typically several times a day. Special <b>meals</b> <b>are</b> usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> different from a snack in that <b>meals</b> <b>are</b> generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks.|$|R

Ninety-seven percent of soybean <b>meal</b> production globally <b>is</b> used as livestock feed. Soybean <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> also used in some dog foods.|$|R
25|$|The second <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> {{the main}} {{meal of the}} day and was eaten in the evening.

Also served from time to time were cheese and fruits such as fresh figs and melon when in season, as well as dried fruits. Water, wine and milk could also accompany the meal.|$|E
25|$|Tamil cuisine {{is typical}} of south Indian cuisine in that rice and rice-derived dishes form the major portion of a diet (see rice and curry).

25|$|There is dispute among {{scholarly}} {{groups as}} to whether the Qumran community was identifiable with the Essenes, but scholars do generally agree that there was an association between the Essenes and the Therapeutae. Philo reported that the Therapeutae's central <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> intended to emulate the holy table set forth in the sacred hall of the temple, but though the Qumran community are portrayed in the Dead Sea Scrolls as viewing the Jerusalem service as having failed to achieve priestly holiness, Philo describes the Therapeutae as deliberately introducing slight differences in their practices from those at the Temple, as a mark of respect for the Temple's shewbread.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian Talmud {{discusses}} {{two types}} of washing at meals: washing before a <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> described as first waters (the Hebrew term is mayim rishonim), and after a <b>meal</b> <b>is</b> known as last waters (the Hebrew term is mayim aharonim).

25|$|Festive meals {{were held}} to mark {{significant}} occasions, entertain important guests, or as sacrificial or ritual meals. The <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> prepared by both men and women. Meat was always served at these meals and many people participated so {{that there would be}} no leftovers that would go to waste. Ritual feasts and banquets in ancient Israel, and the ancient Near East in general, were important for building social relationships and demonstrating status, transacting business and concluding agreements, enlisting divine help, or showing thanks, devotion or propitiation to a deity, and for conveying social instruction. These meals were imbued with significance by the occasion and were a time for entertainment and enjoyment.|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion {{it was concluded that}} the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E
25|$|The eldest male at {{the table}} was always served first, {{commonly}} served {{to them in the}} men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E
