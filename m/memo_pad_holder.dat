50|$|<b>Memo</b> <b>Pad</b> {{can hold}} notes {{of up to}} 4,000 {{characters}} each; the newer Memos app increases field size from 3 to 30 kB. Memos are ordered in two ways: alphabetically, and manually (which allows the user to choose {{the order of the}} memos), and memos can be grouped in user-configurable categories. <b>Memo</b> <b>Pad</b> is for text only, not for drawings, and text can be entered using the Graffiti alphabet, using hardware or software keyboards, or using the 'paste' function. When Palm devices first became available, some Palm users started to create and exchange <b>Memo</b> <b>Pad</b> documents containing generally useful information, which {{came to be known as}} Memoware.|$|R

50|$|Starting with Palm OS version 5.2, Palm created {{customized}} {{versions of}} the common PIM application. Some new features have been added, e.g. support for Address categories, Ringtone associations to users, longer memo texts, etc..

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{by others}} and internal investigations at Philip Morris International (PMI) {{have shown that}} the standard trapping and extraction procedure used for conventional cigarettes, defined in the International Standard ISO 4387 (Cigarettes [...] Determination of total and nicotine-free dry particulate matter using a routine analytical smoking machine), is not suitable for high-water content aerosols. Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of the Cambridge filter <b>pad</b> <b>holder</b> to remove the filter pad as well as during the manual handling of the filter pad, and because the commercially available filter <b>pad</b> <b>holder,</b> which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water. This results in inaccurate values for the water content, and erroneous and overestimated values for Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter (NFDPM). A modified 44 mm Cambridge filter <b>pad</b> <b>holder</b> and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting the loaded filter pad while kept in the Cambridge filter <b>pad</b> <b>holder</b> which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically sealed Cambridge filter <b>pad</b> <b>holder</b> by means of an in situ extractor. The in situ methodology showed a significantly more complete water recovery, resulting in more accurate NFDPM values for high-water content aerosols compared to the standard ISO methodology. The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/”tar” values. This would be for example the case if there were a need to print “tar” yields on packs or compare yields to ceilings. Failure to use the in situ extraction methodology will result in erroneous and overestimated NFDPM/”tar” values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— If {{you are a}} busy person, a {{scheduler}} {{would probably}} be the most indispensable tool you carry. Schedulers come in all forms – diaries, <b>memo</b> <b>pads,</b> computer based scheduling programs, organizers and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants). All these devices use handwriting or a keyboard/pointing device as the primary mode of input, which is not always efficient, particularly when the user does not have time to note anything down. The Speech Driven Personal Scheduling System (SDPSS) proposed in this paper uses speech as a mode of input which is very convenient and useful for a quick note of things. Also, the use of a wireless phone for the purpose eliminates the need to carry a PDA in addition to a phone...|$|R
