5|$|Paralympic {{wheelchair}} curling {{is played}} {{according to the}} rules of the World Curling Federation, the only modification {{is that there is no}} sweeping. The sport was open to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> who competed in mixed teams, with a requirement that each team had at least one member of each sex. The format was a round-robin tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. Britain won their group games against the teams from Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the United States, and lost the matches against Switzerland, Norway and Canada. Their record of four wins and three loses meant they finished the group stage in second place and advanced directly to the medal rounds. In the first end of the semi-final, against Sweden, Britain stole three and went on to win the match 7–3. In the final the team faced Canada. Trailing 6–3 in the final end skip Frank Duffy had an opportunity, with the last stone of the tournament for an open hit of a Canadian stone. If successful he would have scored four for Britain and won them the gold medal but he threw too hard and the shot tracked an inch wide. This meant that Canada scored one to win 7–4, leaving the British team as silver medallists.|$|E
