25|$|Gymnast Luiza Galiulina and runner Tameka Williams {{were also}} suspended. Nadzeya Ostapchuk {{was the first}} athlete to be {{stripped}} of a medal, when she tested positive for <b>metenolone.</b> Valerie Adams was therefore awarded {{the gold medal in}} shot put.|$|E
25|$|Syrian hurdler Ghfran Almouhamad {{became the}} first {{track-and-field}} athlete to be suspended following a positive in-competition doping sample. Nadzeya Astapchuk was stripped of the women's shot put title after her sample came back positive for the banned anabolic agent <b>metenolone.</b> Karin Melis Mey was withdrawn before the long jump final when an earlier failed doping test was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, <b>metenolone</b> (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and <b>metenolone</b> (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E

2500|$|... 10,000 metres final was run on 6 August. Vainio {{took the}} lead after 5700 metres and only Alberto Cova was able to follow him. When the final lap started, these two runners were well over 100 metres ahead of the other runners. This time, hovewer, Vainio {{was not able to}} {{challenge}} Cova, who took the gold with the time 27:47.54. Vainio won silver with the time 27:51.10. Far behind, Mike McLeod was third at the finish line with the time 28:06.22. Vainio also qualified for the 5000 metres final, but was not permitted to start after his doping sample following the 10,000 metres final tested positive for <b>Metenolone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{testosterone}} {{is available}} by prescription for some uses, Primobolan has no approved prescription use. [...] Also known as methenolone or <b>metenolone</b> enanthate, {{it is the}} same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive for in 2000 and 2001. [...] A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally used in conjunction with other steroids. [...] The drug is generally preferred in injected rather than oral form due to its cost. [...] An official statement by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez's test results became public expressed [...] "grave concern" [...] without naming Rodriguez, noting that [...] "because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Metenolone</b> {{enanthate}} (brand names Nibal Injection, Primobolan Depot), or methenolone enanthate, is an injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) group. It is a C17β ester of <b>metenolone,</b> {{and acts}} as a prodrug of <b>metenolone</b> in the body. Whereas <b>metenolone</b> enanthate is the form of <b>metenolone</b> used for intramuscular injection, <b>metenolone</b> acetate is the form used for oral administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metenolone</b> enanthate, {{also known}} as <b>metenolone</b> 17β-enanthate, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is the C17β ester <b>metenolone,</b> which itself is 1-methyl-δ1-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (1-methyl-δ1-DHT) or 1-methyl-5α-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metenolone,</b> or methenolone, {{also known}} as methylandrostenolone, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a {{derivative}} of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). <b>Metenolone</b> itself is not used as an AAS, and the drug is instead supplied as <b>metenolone</b> acetate for oral administration and as <b>metenolone</b> enanthate for depot intramuscular injection. It is no longer widely used medically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metenolone</b> acetate (INN), or methenolone acetate (USAN, BANM) (brand names Primobolan, Primobolan S, Primonabol, Nibal), {{also known}} as 1-methyl-4,5α-dihydro-δ1-testosterone 17β-acetate (1-methyl-δ1-DHT 17β-acetate) or 1-methylandrost-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one 17β-acetate, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and {{derivative}} of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that is marketed in Europe, Australia, and Mexico. It {{has been used in}} the treatment of bone marrow diseases and anemia. <b>Metenolone</b> acetate is the C17β acetate ester and a prodrug of <b>metenolone,</b> and is the form of <b>metenolone</b> that is used orally; the form that is used via depot intramuscular injection is <b>metenolone</b> enanthate. Along with mesterolone, <b>metenolone</b> acetate {{is one of the few}} AAS that is orally active but is not 17α-alkylated.|$|E
50|$|As a {{derivative}} of DHT, <b>metenolone,</b> the active form of <b>metenolone</b> enanthate, is not aromatized, {{and so has}} no propensity for producing estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia. As an AAS, <b>metenolone</b> enanthate is antigonadotropic and can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reversible hypogonadism and infertility.|$|E
50|$|The NBA and NBPA also {{banned the}} use of <b>metenolone</b> under the Anti-Drug Program. In February 2013, Hedo Türkoğlu of the Orlando Magic was {{suspended}} for 20 games without pay by the league after testing positive for <b>metenolone.</b>|$|E
