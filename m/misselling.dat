25|$|In July 2015, Osborne was criticised by John Mann of the Treasury Select Committee {{for ending}} the {{contract}} of Martin Wheatley, {{head of the}} Financial Conduct Authority, and undermining {{the independence of the}} regulator. Wheatley had angered the banks by cracking down on <b>misselling</b> following the payment protection insurance scandal and fining them £1.4B.|$|E
50|$|Various {{common types}} of <b>misselling</b> may occur. More recently, banks {{have been at}} the center of <b>misselling</b> with {{products}} such as ISAs and investments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Misselling</b> is the deliberate, reckless, or negligent sale of {{products}} or services in circumstances where the contract is either misrepresented, or the product or service is unsuitable for the customer's needs. For example, selling life insurance to someone who has no dependents is regarded as <b>misselling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sale of {{unsuitable}} products, such as invalid insurance, is <b>misselling,</b> and {{has led to}} substantial compensation orders.|$|E
5000|$|Financial <b>misselling</b> {{refers to}} {{deliberate}} false statement made by individual, usually a financial organization representative {{to sell off}} their financial products or services usually not profound to the customer. For example, HomeServe an emergency home repair insurance company based in United Kingdom was fined for £30m for <b>misselling</b> to its customers by Financial Conduct Authority in February, 2014 as they failed to explain actual price and its coverage of their financial products. According to a news in The Telegraph, Britain's financial services industry has PPI (payment protection insurance, (sold with credit cards) claims worth around £13bn from 2008 to early 2014. [...] Another on going <b>misselling</b> scandal relates to interest rate swaps sold to small and medium enterprises by UK banks.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 Holmes was {{appointed}} a non-executive director of Clifford Lockyer's now defunct Berkeley Berry Birch (BBB) but resigned shortly thereafter citing problems {{to do with}} his residency in the Republic of Ireland. The failure of BBB was partly attributed to problems with their regulator, the Financial Services Authority, arising from training of the BBB salesforce carried out by Holmes. BBB was publicly censured by the FSA over the <b>misselling</b> of whole of life policies and regular savings plans between 2001 and 2004. Holmes roundly denied that his training was the cause of <b>misselling</b> problems at BBB, citing compliance problems as the cause instead.|$|E
50|$|Although one of {{the prime}} {{responsibilities}} of the FSA was to protect consumers, the FSA was active in trying to ensure companies' anonymity when they were involved in <b>misselling</b> activity, preferring to side with the companies that have been found guilty rather than consumers.|$|E
50|$|Mann {{served on}} the Treasury Select Committee twice, 2003-2005, and 2009-2015, during which time he raised issues around debt, {{financial}} <b>misselling</b> (with particular reference to Credit Cards) and claims handlers. Some commentators have noted Mann's reputation for asking brusque questions, particularly of senior bank executives and George Osborne.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the scheme was {{abandoned}} in October 2001, there were 8,500 accredited providers nationwide. The Department for Education and Skills was investigating 279 providers {{on the basis of}} substantial evidence of <b>misselling,</b> and police had arrested 30 people. Prosecutions based on this fraud were still taking place in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to strong}} {{incentives}} (including taxation, <b>misselling</b> {{and other forms}} of fraud) to misstate financial information, auditing has become a legal requirement for many entities who have the power to exploit financial information for personal gain. Traditionally, audits were mainly associated with gaining information about financial systems and the financial records of a company or a business.|$|E
50|$|Santander has {{frequently}} been rated the worst {{bank in the}} UK for customer service, although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India. During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the <b>misselling</b> of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.|$|E
50|$|The {{projected}} endowment returns used {{in selling}} {{these types of}} products was often in excess of 10%pa. As these levels of return have not been achieved over recent years, many endowments are currently maturing (or are projected to mature) with a significant shortfall. This has led to endowment <b>misselling</b> compensation claims being made in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|The Financial Services Authority fined Egg £721,000 in December 2008 for the {{persistent}} <b>misselling</b> of payment protection insurance (PPI) on its credit cards. The authority's director of enforcement, Margaret Cole, said [...] "Egg used inappropriate sales techniques {{to try to}} persuade customers to buy payment protection insurance on their credit card, even when they asserted they did not want the cover." ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} financial products {{where all}} the functions (sales, operations, service, fund management, depository) are done by one company, NPS follows an unbundled architecture where {{each step of the}} value chain has been made disjointed from the other. This unbundling not only allows the customer to mix and match his providers of service through the value chain, picking the best-suited option, but it also curbs the incidence of <b>misselling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Zemiology is {{the study}} of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the Greek word ζημία zēmía, meaning [...] "harm".It {{originated}} as a critique of criminology and the notion of crime. In contrast with [...] "individual-based harms" [...] such as theft, the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by nation states and corporations. These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as neo-Marxists and feminists who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely criminalised such as mortgage <b>misselling,</b> poverty and unemployment.|$|E
5000|$|The Central Bank of Ireland in April 2014 was {{described}} as having [...] "arbitrarily excluded the majority of consumers" [...] from getting compensation for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance, by setting a cutoff date of 2007 when it introduced its Consumer Protection Code. UK banks provided over £22bn for PPI <b>misselling</b> costs - which, if scaled on a pro-rata basis, is many multiples of the compensation the Irish banks were asked to repay. The offending banks were also not fined which was {{in sharp contrast to}} the regime imposed on UK banks. Lawyers were appalled at the [...] "reckless" [...] advice the Irish Central Bank gave consumers who were missold PPI policies, which [...] "will play into the hands of the financial institution." ...|$|E

40|$|We study {{deceptive}} selling (or <b>misselling)</b> {{through a}} firm’s agents. Agents who {{are paid to}} originate sales are biased towards making deceptive statements or providing wrong advice so as to increase sales volume. We ask first what affects firms ’ costs to ensure compliance with a given standard, thereby determining when firms become more permissive towards <b>misselling.</b> We then show how by taking into consideration the underlying agency problem the optimal policy response must depend {{on the degree of}} competition, the organization of the sales process, the nature of compliance costs, and the transparency of the commission structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of the inherent conflict between two tasks performed by sales agents: prospecting for customers and advising on the suitability of the product to the customers ’ specific needs. When structuring their salesforce compensation, firms trade off the expected losses resulting from “misselling ” with the agency costs of providing marketing incentives. We characterize how the equilibrium amount of <b>misselling</b> and the scope for policy intervention depend on a number of features of the identified agency problem, such as a firm’s internal organization of the sales process, the transparency of its commission structure, and the steepness of its agents ’ sales incentives...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the methodology and observational data from a project that sought to, first, investigate the prevalence of alcohol related harm and alcohol misuse in Cardiff's night-time economy and, second, deliver a targeted server training intervention to premises identified as at risk of <b>misselling</b> alcohol. The bulk {{of the work is}} centred on a novel breathalyser survey of drinkers conducted on one Saturday and one Friday each month for 12 months. Due to its novelty in a UK context and the potential value of objective alcohol misuse data, the survey provided important insights into appropriate methodologies for surveying night time economies as well as unique insights into the nature of alcohol misuse...|$|E
40|$|From leaky {{buildings}} to financial crashes, from mining disasters to deep water oil spills and from poor patient care to financial <b>misselling,</b> regulation can fail to prevent disasters {{arising from the}} risks {{it is meant to}} manage. Although each disaster is unique in many respects, analysis of the regulatory failings that contributed to those disasters reveals a number of common themes. When regulation fails, it fails in quite consistent ways. Dissecting regulatory disasters to find out what lessons can be learned, this lecture, now transcribed here, was presented by Professor Julia Black, as the 2014 Sir Frank Holmes Memorial Lecture in Policy Studies on 1 April 2014.

40|$|Financial {{intermediation}} due to <b>misselling</b> harms consumers. The work {{concerns to}} regulation of financial intermediaries and relation between financial intermediary {{and his or}} her client. The main objective is to analyze how the regulatory of commissions impact financial intermediation. The paper analyzes the current form of legal status of financial intermediation in the European Union and the Czech Republic and results in analyzing the impacts of regulatory proposals that was discussed in Chamber of Deputies Parliament of the Czech Republic. It concludes that if the proposals were accepted, it will not improve the quality of consumer protection, but even can cause damage to the client. The current legislative base moreover provides sufficient resources to prosecuting financial intermediation, which does not respect the client's interest. For analyzing the relation between financial intermediary {{and his or her}} client is developed theoretical model based on theory of games...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of the international student market has coincided with a 'dramatic proliferation' of universities using agents to recruit international students. This practice is controversial due to the apparent conflict of interest between prospecting for students for a particular university, and advising students on that university???s suitability. Our paper analyses the challenges that arise from using agents. We find that there are examples of unethical practice, such as <b>misselling</b> and financial fraud. Yet we also explore the services that agents provide to students and universities, and find that they cannot easily be replicated by organisations that do not face the same inherent conflict of interest. The paper goes on to discuss the current picture in terms of regulation, both in the UK and further afield, {{and a range of}} other regulatory options. We conclude by recommending that the UK moves towards a sector-wide system of self-regulation {{to improve the quality of}} advice to potential students and reduce the risk of unethical practice...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the implications of}} the inherent conflict between two tasks performed by direct marketing agents: prospecting for customers and advising on the product’s “suitability ” for the specific needs of customers. When structuring salesforce compensation, firms trade off the expected losses from “misselling ” unsuitable products with the agency costs of providing marketing incentives. We characterize how the equilibrium amount of <b>misselling</b> (and thus the scope of policy intervention) depends on features of the agency problem including: the internal organization of a firm’s sales process, the transparency of its commission structure, and the steepness of its agents’ sales incentives. (JEL M 31, M 37, M 52) When purchasing unfamiliar products, consumers often rely on information and advice provided by representatives of the seller. This creates the possibility of “misselling, ” the questionable practice of a salesperson selling a product that may not match a customer’s specific needs. 1 This problem is particularly severe in markets for technically complex products, such as consumer electronics, auto repairs, medical care, and retail financial services including securities...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} 310 {{structured note}} lawsuits in Taiwan between 2000 and 2013 to examine courts’ attitude {{in dealing with}} claims of <b>misselling</b> retail structured notes. We find that courts were generally not favorable to retail investors. This provides a contrast with the financial regulator’s efforts to improve financial consumer protection since 2008. By examining plaintiffs’ key arguments and courts’ rulings, we find {{that it was difficult}} for investors to fulfill their burden of proof and courts were reluctant to award remedies when investors did sign on a contractual document confirming his knowledge on a few matters. While regulators are right to strengthen financial consumer protection, this article argues that Taiwan courts’ inactivism to protect retail investors could be justified. However, regulators should pick up from what courts have left to ensure that customers fully comprehend the consequences when they sign on contractual documents, to avoid banks classifying customers as active investors too easily, and to clarify banks’ duties toward a customer after a contract is signed. Regulators should also reconsider its regulatory structure to ensure foreign banks {{would not be able to}} issue securities to raise funds from local investors by way of a shadow banking system...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the results}} of 322 lawsuits regarding retail mutual funds and structured notes in Taiwan between 2000 and 2012 and their relationship with other factors such as investors’ personal characteristics, main arguments and causes of action. This article has the following major findings: (1) the winning rate for investors was quite low, meaning that banks face low legal risk from <b>misselling</b> claims; (2) investors were not better off by filing a complaint to the Banker’s Association; (3) we have not proved the courts showing preference for investors with certain personal traits due to limited information available; (4) a plaintiff’s winning rate does not vary much from one argument to another, except for arguing formation of contract, but our research shows that more {{might have to be}} done to clarify post-contractual duty of banks; (5) there is also no proof showing that certain causes of action or litigation strategies would help investors winning a judgment and we have not proved that filing more causes of action would help to increate a plaintiff’s chance of winning. Our findings worth regulators and legislators to reconsider regulatory policies for investor protection as well as dispute resolution for financial consumers in the future to offer more complete protection of financial consumers...|$|E
40|$|Even {{if there}} is no uniform and legal {{definition}} of the term “hedge fund”, it is generally agreed amongst securities regulators that all hedge funds have potentially common characteristics: no self imposed rules in terms of diversification of assets, unlimited use of derivatives and of complex financial techniques, intensive use of leveraging and substantial performance commissions, and shares not frequently redeemable by the investors. At the international level, hedge funds cannot be considered any longer as a « black hole » in the financial sphere given the growing number of regulatory authorities that have already implemented supervisory systems in relation to such funds. It is obvious though that much remains to be done in this ever changing area, which is all the more complex to regulate that it today is the object of prejudice that can sometimes generate confusion. Hedge funds’ “shareholder activism” is both criticized and hailed as a mechanism creating value. Their risk-taking approach generates concerns as to financial stability and can nevertheless supply welcome liquidity to the markets. The transparency of their operations is considered as being insuffi cient, whereas their strategies make them truly successful with an increasing number of investors. The clarification of the specific risks attached to hedge funds’ activity is therefore a prerequisite to defining the regulators’ priorities for action. The AMF has identifi ed five main areas that may need further initiatives at the international level: • the systemic risk due to the potential failure of a large-size hedge fund or a chain of several smaller hedge funds leads to consider improvements of the investors’ credit risk assessment on hedge funds by, for example, urging hedge funds’ rating; • the risk of market abuse calls for ways to enhance the transparency of the hedge funds’ activities on OTC markets; • the risk for the governance of listed companies and of misbehaviour put into question certain practices such as stock lending at shareholders’ meetings; • the operational risk of incorrect valuation of illiquid or complex assets has pushed IOSCO to take initiatives on the valuation process and internal controls of hedge funds; • the risk of <b>misselling</b> to insufficiently informed investors requests new domestic and international standards before any further retail exposure to alternative products. ...|$|E
