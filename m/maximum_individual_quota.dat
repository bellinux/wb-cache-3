40|$|The goose barnacle, "Pollicipes pollicipes", is an {{intertidal}} cirripede {{that lives}} attached to rocks on very exposed shores, forming dense aggregations. It {{occurs in the}} northeast Atlantic (from 48 to 14 ◦N). Commercial fisheries have been developed in several countries, but except for a short-lived local consumption, most of the production is traded in the Spanish market, where the price can reach ? 80 /kg in first-sale auctions. This species shows a strong spatial structure, constituting metapopulations with local adult populations sharing a common larval pool. Advection of larvae depends largely of oceanographic conditions that govern larval transport and survival. In Galicia (NW Spain), the regional government regulations promote a co-management system between fishers’ organisations (“cofradías”) and the fisheries authority through territorial user rights for fishing (TURFs). Since 1992, the exploitation is granted to “cofradías” after presentation of an annual plan of exploitation and management, where fishing (daily allocation of effort, <b>maximum</b> <b>individual</b> <b>quotas</b> and area of exploitation), surveillance and the commercialisation processes are established. The recent implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) designed {{for the management of}} Pollicipes in Galicia will allow for new ways to improve the elaboration and control of management plans by fishers’ organisations using a combination of the available statistical data and computer-based methods. The system, including databases and software for the visualisation of geographic information, was designed for independent use in each “cofradía” or in a network, and its results are accessible in a web site ([URL]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>quota</b> (IQ) {{programs}} are a promising and increasingly common means of regulating fisheries. This paper examines how profit maximizing fishers respond to {{different types of}} IQ programs in fisheries where many types of fish are harvested simultaneously. This analysis shows that the most common types of <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> programs can induce discarding, and that <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> programs that regulate the value of harvest never induce discarding. Since discarded fish have a high mortality rate, "value-based" <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> {{programs are}} superior to their more conventional counterparts in that they waste fewer fish. The disadvantages of value-based quotas are also examined. Results are driven {{by the fact that}} the harvest technology examined here does not satisfy a "free-disposal" assumption.

40|$|In this article, we {{assess the}} effect that two {{different}} fishery management regimes have on {{the duration of the}} fishing trip. A basic theoretical model predicts that trip duration should increase with temporal closures and decrease with an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> system. Therefore, we propose and apply an empirical trip duration model. Estimations are based on data for the pelagic fleet in central-southern Chile. Conforming to the theoretical predictions, the results indicate that temporal closures tend to increase trip duration, whereas <b>individual</b> <b>quotas</b> reduce it. Moreover, the regulatory regimes also affect the magnitude of the impact that other determinants have on trip duration. The results are consistent with increased efficiency in fleet operation under an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> system. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{fisheries}} {{are managed}} by {{total allowable catches}} (TACs) and a substantial part by <b>individual</b> <b>quotas.</b> Such output management has not been successful in mixed fisheries when fishers continue to fish while discarding marketable fish. We analyse the effects of <b>individual</b> <b>quotas</b> on spatial and temporal effort allocation and over-quota discarding in a multispecies fishery. Using a spatially explicit dynamic-state variable model, the optimal fishing strategy of fishers constrained by annual <b>individual</b> <b>quotas,</b> facing uncertainty in catch rates, is studied. Individual fishers will move away from areas with high catches of the restricted quota species and, depending {{on the cost of}} fishing, will stop fishing in certain periods of the year. Individual vessels will discard marketable fish, but only after their <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> for the species under consideration has been reached. These results are in line with observations on effort allocation and discarding of marketable fish, both over-quota discarding and highgrading, by the Dutch beam-trawl fleet.

40|$|Abstract OnlyIn 2010, the New England Groundfish fishery {{adopted a}} sector-based {{management}} plan, wherein self-identifying groups of harvesters are allocated their collective total {{share of the}} harvest of each species as a group right, that they may manage in any way they wish. This means a single fishery with a single set of overall total allowable catches can be managed by multiple management systems concurrently. We ask whether common pool or <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> type management systems {{are more likely to}} emerge as groups gain experience with their collective rights. In a novel quasi-continuous time experimental environment with a contemporaneous price externality, harvesters can choose to affiliate with a common pool managed group, or an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> managed group. The common pool group engages in a fishing derby and receives lower prices, whereas the <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> group achieves stable harvest levels throughout each season to minimize the price externality. Through successive fishing seasons, the frequency of choosing <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> rises from about half to over 90 % of subjects. This suggests that the efficiencies associated with strong individual fishing rights may emerge endogenously from the sectorization process, even without imposing them through regulation. The choice to remain in the common pool is explained by competitive success, but not risk preferences, social preferences or competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Bycatch is {{a nearly}} {{universal}} problem for fisheries, {{and it is}} increasingly common to place strict limits on allowable bycatch either on individuals or an industry sector. <b>Individual</b> bycatch <b>quotas</b> strengthen <b>individual</b> incentives to avoid bycatch and may reduce {{the likelihood that the}} bycatch cap will limit target species catch.

The European Commission is considering {{the imposition of a}} discard ban to preserve vulnerable and economically important fish stocks. We explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system. We examined in particular the performance of 2 different management scenarios: (1) <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> management with a tolerance for discarding and (2) <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> management in combination with a discard ban, using a dynamic state variable model.

The experimental subjects are fishermen who participate {{in a series of}} fishing seasons. The experiment assumes that (a) managers limit aggregate harvests each season to a total quota; (b) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their share of total fishing expenditures; (c) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their assigned fishing skill, and (d) rents are dissipated to the extent that total expenditures exceed the minimum necessary to catch the total quota. Total quotas and fish prices which together determine the catch value vary between seasons. After only a few seasons, subjects dissipate almost all potential rents by increasing expenditures to try to increase their shares of the rents. Increases in prices lead to increased rent dissipation; lower prices lead to reduced rent dissipation. Heterogeneity of fishing skill reduces the extent of rent dissipation, as fishing becomes relatively less profitable for less skilled participants. More skilled participants capture significant rents. After gaining experience with a fishery without <b>individual</b> <b>quotas,</b> subjects vote on whether to switch to <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> (IQ) management. Subjects are more likely to vote for <b>individual</b> <b>quotas</b> the higher their quota allocations.
