40|$|The {{potential}} energy {{surfaces of the}} van der Waals complexes benzene–Ar and p-difluorobenzene– Ar have been investigated at the second-order Møller–Plesset (MP 2) level of theory with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. Calculations were performed with unconstrained geometry optimization for all stationary points. This study has been performed to elucidate {{the nature of a}} conflict between experimental results from dispersed fluorescence and velocity map imaging (VMI). The inconsistency is that spectra for levels of p-difluorobenzene–Ar and –Kr below the dissociation thresholds determined by VMI show bands where free p-difluorobenzene emits, suggesting that dissociation is occurring. We proposed that the bands observed in the dispersed fluorescence spectra are due to emission from states in which the rare gas atom orbits the aromatic chromophore; these states are populated by intramolecular vibrational redistribution from the initially excited level [S. M. Bellm, R. J. Moulds, and W. D. Lawrance, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 10709 (2001) ]. To test this proposition, stationary points have been located on both the benzene–Ar and p-difluorobenzene–Ar {{potential energy}} surfaces (PESs) to determine the barriers to this orbiting motion. Comparison with previous single point CCSD(T) calculations of the benzene–Ar PES has been used to determine the amount by which the barriers are overestimated at the MP 2 level. As there is little difference in the comparable regions of the benzene–Ar and p-difluorobenzene–Ar PESs, the overestimation is expected to be similar for p-difluorobenzene–Ar. Allowing for this overestimation gives the barrier to movement of the Ar atom around the pDFB ring via the valley between the H atoms as [less than or equal to] 204 cm⁻¹ in So (including zero point energy). From the estimated change upon electronic excitation, the corresponding barrier in S 1 is estimated to be [less than or equal to] 225 cm⁻¹. This barrier is less than the 240 cm⁻¹ energy of 30 ², the vibrational level for which the anomalous "free p-difluorobenzene" bands were observed in dispersed fluorescence from p-difluorobenzene–Ar, supporting our hypothesis for the origin of these bands.

5000|$|Ancient coins {{were made}} by casting in moulds or by {{striking}} between engraved dies. The Romans cast their larger copper coins in clay moulds carrying distinctive markings, not because they knew nothing of striking, {{but because it was}} not suitable for such large masses of metal. Casting is now used only by counterfeiters. The most ancient coins were cast in bulletshaped or conical <b>moulds</b> and <b>marked</b> on one side by means of a die which was struck with a hammer. The [...] "blank" [...] or unmarked piece of metal was placed on a small anvil, and the die was held in position with tongs. The reverse or lower side of the coin received a rectangular mark made by the sharp edges of the little anvil. Subsequently, the anvil was marked in various ways, and decorated with letters and figures of beasts, and later still the anvil was replaced by a reverse die. The spherical blanks soon gave place to lenticular-shaped ones. The blank was made red-hot and struck between cold dies. One blow was usually insufficient, and the method was similar to that still used in striking medals in high relief, except that the blank is now allowed to cool before being struck. With the substitution of iron for bronze as the material for dies, about 300 AD, the practice of striking the blanks while they were hot was gradually discarded.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: A Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis method giving possibility in the very precise solution was take advantage in examinations of differences between samples taken from each places injection moulding part. Research samples were cut from the flat plate and then were taken advantage to research. The method of the sampling was presented in the figure.

40|$|Fungal {{exposure}} {{had been}} repeatedly {{associated with a}} wide range of harmful health effects. The first association between mould exposure and asthma exacerbations was reported almost 300 years ago and since then, they are numerous data on the link between mould sensitization and asthma severity. Most of the data on fungi and asthma concern A. alternata, C. herbarum and A. fumigatus. However, some mould species are known for their more pronounced indoor tropism and since people tend to increase their time spent indoors, the impact of exposure to these “indoor” species cannot be neglected. In the first part of this work, we developed and validated a dot-blot assay for the detection of mould sensitizations against a panel of species. We worked with the classical A. alternata, C. herbarum and A. fumigatus but in addition, we included indoor-related species such as P. chrysogenum, P. brevicompactum, C. sphaerospermum, C. cladosporioides, A. versicolor and more ubiquitous A. niger, and A. flavus. The development of such an assay allowed us to detect sensitizations against species that are not routinely investigated or not available for testing with classical methods such as skin prick tests or CAP tests. In addition, to cope with cross-reactions, a well-described phenomenon with regard to response against moulds, we developed and validated the concept of “major sensitization”, defined as the antigenic response with the highest difference as compared to the variation of response of the negative control. As there are few data on mould sensitization in healthy individuals, the dot-blot assay was used in a large cohort of healthy subjects. The most frequent sensitizations were observed against A. alternata, A. flavus and A. niger and the commonest “major sensitizers” were A. niger and A. alternata. Of note, in this cohort, no “major sensitization” against A. fumigatus was detected while “major sensitization” against a group of species more specifically linked to the indoor environment (Penicillium spp, A. versicolor, C. cladosporioides) reached more than 25. 1 % of all sensitizations. These findings were quite surprising and since our laboratory had previous expertise with mouse-model of A. alternata-induced asthma, we investigated the inflammatory and allergenic properties of several fungal species to determine if they display different inner inflammatory potential. Six species were included in the panel A. alternata, A. fumigatus, C. cladosporioides, C. sphaerospermum, A. versicolor and P. chrysogenum. Results showed real differences between moulds and while the classification is not clear-cut, A. fumigatus or P. chrysogenum triggered a typical pro-Th 2 response, A. alternata and C. sphaerospermum rather induced a neutrophilic inflammation and A. versicolor and C. cladosporioides induced a mixed Th 2 /Th 17 response. In parallel, the sensitization rates and profile were also investigated in a group of mould-sensitized asthmatics and they both differed notably with the healthy cohort. Indeed, in asthmatic patients, the two most frequent major sensitizations were against A. fumigatus (32 %) and A. alternata (28 %). The last part of the work consisted in a case-control study to evaluate and compare asthma severity markers and indoor mould exposure between the group of mould-sensitized asthmatics (cases) and a group of asthmatics without mould sensitization (controls). Some interesting findings emerged from this study. First, the overall mould contamination (airborne, in settled dust or through visible <b>mould</b> <b>marks)</b> was very high and more than 90 % of the visited dwellings were contaminated by at least one mould species/genus (Penicillium spp, A. versicolor, A. fumigatus and C. sphaerospermum) in at least one type of sample (air, dust and visible mould imprints). Of note, overall “indoor mould exposure” was not associated with markers of asthma severity. Second, exposure and sensitization but also sensitization alone to A. fumigatus in asthmatics were associated with asthma severity markers compared to the absence of mould sensitization which confirmed its noxious potential. This contrasted with the absence of significant severity markers associated with other sensitizations. Lastly, we observed a positive link between overall indoor exposure to Penicillium spp and a reduced lung function in asthmatics even in the absence of sensitization.

Autor, dalje, pripisuje nalazište nizu sinkronih grobalja bjelobrdske kulture otkrivenih u međurječju Drave, Dunava i Save. Ta groblja na redove zorno su predočenje tvarne kulture autohtonoga pučanstva, koje je potkraj 11. stoljeća, dakle neposredno prije Uključenja prostora zapadnog dijela savsko-dravskog međurječja pod mađarsko vrhovništvo i prije uspostave biskupije u Zagrebu, naseljavalo i prostore Kalničkog prigorja. Groblje Bjelobrdske kulture kod sela Popovca ocrtava segment duhovnosti male srednjovjekovne zajednice na svršetku vladavine posljednjih hrvatskih kraljeva. Long ago the {{attention}} of archaeologists was focused on a mountain valley in the slopes of Kalnik (Table I) by a few chance finds. These finds were discovered alongside a village lane on the south-west slopes of Bregi Hill {{to the north of}} Popovec under Kalnik. While working in their vineyards and fields to the east and west of the lane leading there, the peasants from Popovec village often came across numerous remains of human skeletons and other finds which indicated the existence of an old cemetery. The finds, mostly jewelry, were collected during a survey of the site or field works and, especially, during three not very extensive archaeological campaigns. Typological analysis has enabled a precise chronology of the burials in the cemetery near Popovec. From thorough evaluation of the inventory of the cemetery a chronological and typological table of burials on the site has been established (Table VII). An isolated, chance find of a cast earring of the 14 a type, undoubtedly an earlier piece of jewelry, marks the lower time limit when the cemetery was first used. Other analyzed pieces of jewelry such as a small ring with an S-shaped loop (type I-II), necklaces of pierced facetted pearls (type 41 a), innovations of cast rustic " Volinjane-type" earrings (type 17 b) and a small cast cross (type 45), cover most of the time period of burials at Popovec (see Table VII) which leads to the conclusion that burials on this site must have been started {{towards the end of the}} first stage of Bijelo Brdo culture, probably around 1015 - 1020 (Table VII). The appearance of the cast silver rustic earring (type 17 b) further confirms such a hypothesis, especially the lower time limit. The lead cross cast in a one-piece <b>mould</b> (<b>marked</b> as type 45 and dated to the late phase of the second stage) marks the upper time limit of burials on the Bregi Cemetery. According to Giesler 2 ̆ 7 s chronology, the beginning of the latter phase must be around the year 1070 which would mean that the cemetery stopped being used around 1070 - 1080. The proposed time limit from 1015 - 1020 until 1070 - 1080 leads to the conclusion that two to three generations from the nearby Mediaeval village were buried here. When the cemetery near Popovec was no longer used burials continued in neighbouring cemeteries. In the late 11 th century the central cemetery might have been the nearby St Peter 2 ̆ 7 s (Sv. Petar Orehovac) where the present-day parish church with an interesting dedication and central cemetery serving several villages under Kalnik is located. Further research on the site will either confirm or reject this hypothesis. From the chronological and typological table it can be concluded that the Bijelo Brdo Cemetery near Popovec was used from the end of the rule of the Croatian kings Mihajlo Krešimir III (1000 - 1030) until the end of Petar Krešimir IV 2 ̆ 7 s (1058 - 1074), that is, under the beginning of Dtnitar 2 ̆ 7 s or Zvonimir 2 ̆ 7 s rule (1074 - 1093). From 1027, the Kalnik area was governed by the Svetislavić family descended from the Trpimirović line. From 1075, Zvonimir was a strong king, but earlier as a governor of Slavonski Banat or Dukat, de facto, the area between the Drava and Sava Rivers, he tried to make firm family contacts with rulers from the Arpad line because of the Ottoman danger. Later this proved fatal for the Croatian Kingdom as a whole. With the assent of Ladislav I from the Arpad family (1077 - 1095) to the Croatian throne and the restitution of power in the area between the Sava and Drava and, especially, the foundation of the Zagreb bishopric (1093 - 94), the way was paved for the organization of the church hierarchy. This is an historical frame and the moment when the cemetery around the Church St Peter 2 ̆ 7 s in Orehovac must have been centralJy used by a dozen nearby Mediaeval villages. During the rule of Ladislav I and, especially, Koloman this was imposed by law. Due to the chronological frame in which burials on the southwestern slopes of the Bregi site under Kalnik were practiced, that population, undoubtedly autochtonous Slavs, should be identified with the Croatian population which settled that historic area of central Croatia. The former population created Mediaeval Bijelo Brdo culture as manifested by the inventory of the burials. The Croats represent an autochtonous ethnic base which only later partly assimilated with the Hungarians. That is, with the rulers from the royal house of the Arpads a specific way of coexistence was formed on the entire territory of Mediaeval Croatia. This was preceded by a culture which can be recognized and evidenced in burial sites on the Bregi site under Kalnik Hill. The Bijelo Brdo culture was widely accepted which testifies to its rooting in the population which created and used the same jewelry and related typology of forms on a vast territory from east Slavonian fields between the Sava and Drava to Kalnik Hill. This material culture offered as spiritual wealth to the dead, accompanied them in their life after death before the coming of the Hungarians as is evidenced by the finds of the Bijelo Brdo Cemetery in Popovec-Bregi...|$|R
