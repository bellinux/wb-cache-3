50|$|Magnitudes. In typical applications, {{both the}} {{inductance}} and {{the resistance of}} the gyrator are much greater than that of a physical inductor. Gyrators can be used to create inductors from the <b>microhenry</b> range up to the megahenry range. Physical inductors are typically limited to tens of henries, and have parasitic series resistances from hundreds of microhms through the low kilohm range. The parasitic resistance of a gyrator depends on the topology, but with the topology shown, series resistances will typically range from tens of ohms through hundreds of kilohms.|$|E
40|$|A Low Cost Control for {{a compact}} High-Power High-Speed Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) Machine has been {{developed}} in this research. The machine under consideration {{has been designed to}} run in the generation {{as well as in the}} motoring mode for utilization in vast industrial and automotive applications. When used as a motor for automotive applications, the machine is directly coupled to a radial inward flow compressor to operate as an electric driven supercharger running in the range of 40, 000 – 50, 00 rpm. To run the machine as a motor at its rated speed and power, a suitable electric drive and controller has to be utilized while considering the machine performance characteristics. Most of the available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems are either designed for low-speed high-power machines or high-speed, low-power machines. In addition, the self inductance of such machines are relatively high (in the range of hundreds of millihenry) compared to the AFPM machine under consideration which has a very low self inductance (in the range of tens of <b>microhenry).</b> The low inductance of PM machines often makes current control difficult. If high switching frequencies are not used, the current ripple in the machine windings will be very high, causing degradation of the overall machine efficiency and increasing the rotor torque ripple and pulsation. In this research a high frequency inverter-based controllers using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) is utilized to overcome the problem of the low inductance o...|$|E

40|$|The University of Missouri-Columbia is {{developing}} a compact pulsed power system to condition the high current signal from a flux compression generator (FCG) to the high voltage, high frequency signal required for many pulsed power applications. The system consists of a non-magnetic core, spiral-wound transformer, series exploding wire fuse, and an oscillating mesoband source. The flux compression generator is being built by Texas Tech Univ. and is designed to drive inductive loads {{on the order of}} <b>microhenries</b> rather than a nanohenry load often driven by FCGs.

50|$|The {{amount of}} power loading the glass can handle is the major {{mechanical}} limit. Even if {{the amount of energy}} (joules) that is used remains constant, electrical power (wattage) will increase in inverse proportion to a decrease in discharge time. Therefore, energy must be decreased along with the pulse duration, to keep the pulsed power levels from rising too high. Quartz glass (1 millimeter thick per 1 second discharge) can usually withstand a maximum of 160 watts per square centimeter of internal surface-area. Other glasses have a much lower threshold. Extremely fast systems, with inductance below critical damping (0.8 <b>microhenries),</b> usually require a shunt diode across the capacitor, to prevent current reversal (ringing) from destroying the lamp. If the pulse is allowed to ring through the lamp it will lengthen the flash, so the diode traps the ringing, allowing the lamp shut down at the correct time.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 46) It is {{well known}} that many types of electronic devices are extremely sensitive to the presence of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference (EMI). Electromagnetic interference affects a device either by conduction or radiation. In most cases, the first step in solving the EMI problem in a device is to define the susceptible circuit, the interference transmission path(s) and the source. Once having identified these parameters, it is necessary to reduce the RF energy arriving at the susceptible device. One method for reducing interference is to provide filtering on the device power line. A normal power line filter is built as a classical low pass filter, that is, series inductors and shunt capacitors either in L, T or pi configuration. For adequate insertion loss these filters must have either 20 - 600 <b>microhenries</b> inductance or. 01 to 2 microfarads or more capacitance. Due to safety reasons in commercial equipment, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) limits the shunt capacitance from each power line to chassis ground to a value which allows less than 5 milliamperes of current to flow to the chassis under the most adverse conditions of frequency and voltage. This current limitation is even more stringent in some medical electronic applications. When the shunt capacitance is limited, the inductance in a filter must be increased to retain the same cutoff frequency (fc). However, the inductor will cause a voltage drop equal to IWL. When L is large and I is large due to machine power requirements, this voltage drop may be large enough to impair the function of the machine. In addition, the size of the inductor must be physically large to prevent the saturation of the core. This imposes problems of size and weight which can be objectionable. In some circumstances, a common mode filter can be used to attain the required insertion loss while minimizing size and weight requirements. The non-availability of design aids and the unpredictable behavior of the common-mode filter led to a detailed analysis of the common-mode filter. The common-mode filter circuits were analyzed using the Electronics Circuit Analysis Program...|$|R
