5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture <b>mapper.</b> Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E
5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data <b>mapper</b> to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E
5|$|Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, <b>mapper</b> and spy, who, {{along with}} T. E.

5000|$|The project {{provides}} an interface for users {{to assist in}} identification, mapping and characterization of surface features using visual data provided by NASA missions. Crater counting is described as [...] "a valuable exercise, but it's hard to automate." [...] Surface features, such as the size and degradation of craters, are identified by individual users and submitted back to the project, where they are collected alongside the contributions of other citizen scientists. CosmoQuest projects have included Planet <b>Mappers,</b> Moon <b>Mappers,</b> Asteroid <b>Mappers,</b> and a future project, Planet Investigators. A mobile application is available {{as part of the}} Moon <b>Mappers</b> project, Moon <b>Mappers</b> Crater Decay.|$|R
30|$|Once the map task is {{completed}} and reported {{back to the}} server, each <b>mapper’s</b> address is stored in the VMR server’s database. After receiving a work request from a reducer, the VMR server includes the addresses of <b>mappers</b> that hold each of the map output files on the reply. Since map tasks are replicated, several <b>mappers</b> hold each map output file. Therefore, all reduce tasks sent to VMR reducers have {{the location of the}} required input data, as a list of IP addresses of <b>mappers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Moon Mineralogy <b>Mapper</b> (M3), an imaging spectrometer, {{was one of}} the 11 {{instruments}} {{on board}} Chandrayaan-I that came to a premature end on 28 August 2009. M3 was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{mineral content}} on {{the lunar surface}} was mapped with the Moon Mineralogy <b>Mapper</b> (M3), a NASA {{instrument}} on board the orbiter. The presence of iron was reiterated and changes in rock and mineral composition have been identified.

25|$|Although {{the results}} are {{consistent}} with recent findings of other NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan-1 (the Moon Mineralogy <b>Mapper</b> (MP3) discovered water molecules in the Moon's polar regions, while water vapour was detected by NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS) this observation is not consistent with the presence of thick deposits of nearly pure water ice within a few meters of the lunar surface, but it does not rule out the presence of small (cm), discrete pieces of ice mixed in with the regolith.|$|E

30|$|The {{programming}} {{model used}} in Hadoop is MapReduce [9] which was proposed by Dean and Ghemawat at Google. MapReduce {{is the basic}} data processing scheme used in Hadoop which includes breaking the entire task into two parts, known as <b>mappers</b> and reducers. At a high-level, <b>mappers</b> read the data from HDFS, process it and generate some intermediate results to the reducers. Reducers are used to aggregate the intermediate results to generate the final output which is again written to HDFS. A typical Hadoop job involves running several <b>mappers</b> and reducers across different nodes in the cluster. A good survey about MapReduce for parallel data processing is available in [10].|$|R

Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.|$|E
25|$|Centuries before Kiruna {{was founded}} in 1900, the {{presence}} of iron ore at Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara had been known by the local Sami population. In 1696, Samuel Mört, a bookkeeper of the Kengis works, wrote {{on the presence of}} iron in the two hills. The Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and <b>mapper</b> Anders Hackzell mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names Fredriks berg (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and Berget Ulrika Eleonora (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden Fredrik I and his wife Ulrika Eleonora.|$|E
25|$|The {{brightness}} and {{purity of the}} water ice in Saturn's rings has been cited {{as evidence that the}} rings are much younger than Saturn, perhaps just 100 million years old, as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System. Ring material may be recycled as clumps form within the rings and are then disrupted by impacts. This would explain the apparent youth of some of the material within the rings. Further evidence supporting a young ring theory has been gathered by researchers analyzing data from the Cassini Titan Radar <b>Mapper,</b> which focused on analyzing the proportion of rocky silicates contained within the C ring.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, it is {{possible}} to chain multiple MapReduce phases. It suffices to take the output of the Reducers as input for a subsequent cycle of <b>Mappers.</b> Google’s PageRank algorithm is computed through three MapReduce phases, the second of which is repeated until convergence of some numerical value is reached [9]. The algorithm for <b>Mappers</b> and Reducers differs from phase to phase.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Survey {{results from}} 161 {{respondents}} trained in dementia care mapping (DCM) in the United States and United Kingdom (82 and 79 respondents, respectively) addressed the following: (a) To what extent are <b>mappers</b> using DCM? (b) How satisfied are <b>mappers</b> with DCM? (c) What affect does DCM have on mappers’ attitudes toward their dementia practice? and (d) What challenges are encountered by <b>mappers</b> {{in the use}} of DCM? Method: Analyses using odds ratios were used to make international and training-level (basic vs. advanced) comparisons. Results: Differences across countries were found in use of DCM and lack of satisfaction using DCM codes. Similarities were found with positive affects of DCM on attitudes and lack of time for DCM. Discussion: Differences in mappers’ experiences and perceptions exist across the two countries, warranting increased attention to the cultural contexts within which <b>mappers</b> are situated and how these affect the implementation of DCM within a country...|$|R
500|$|Ion Storm {{announced}} Anachronox in April 1997, {{and planned}} for a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall, veteran designer {{and one of}} the founders of Ion Storm, helmed the project and originated most of its story and design. Other founding members of the team were Todd Porter (producer), Jake Hughes (associate producer and director of cinematics), Ben Herrera (artist), Brian Eiserloh (programmer), and David Namaksy (lead <b>mapper).</b> <b>Mapper</b> Larry Herring was hired after being mentored by John Romero and submitting a custom Doom 2 map to Tom Hall. Hall first conceived Anachronox in his bathroom, prompting him to install a whiteboard and sound-recorder in his shower, as well as several notepads around his house for future ideas; he had conceived the character Sly Boots years earlier in college. He wrote a 460-page design document (completed in May 1997) outlining the universe of Anachronox, beyond the game's scope; other game design documents of the period, he noted, were usually only 125 pages in size. He then condensed the story, leaving a third beyond the scheduled game. The game's design phase lasted three months. Hall made plans for two expansion packs from the outset of development, owing to the huge story. Developers told Next Generation the story would be [...] "Campbellian" [...] and feature immense environments. Hall noted in mid-1997, [...] "Not since Keen has a universe been so clear in my head." ...|$|E
