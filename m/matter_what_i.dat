The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries.

[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E

He lost the election and later said, [...] "People knew me only as a baseball player.

[...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E

While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work.

[...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously." [...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death.

500|$|Parsons and Sara {{were in an}} open {{relationship}} {{encouraged by}} the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated {{to find a new}} partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that [...] "our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no <b>matter</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." [...] He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman {{for the rest of his}} life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his [...] "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, [...] "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" [...] while Hubbard [...] "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions." ...|$|E
