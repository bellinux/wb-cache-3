5|$|While it is {{possible}} to access Xgrid from the command line, the Xgrid graphical user interface, a program bundled with <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server. This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server.|$|E
5|$|It {{provides}} network administrators {{a method}} of creating a computing cluster, which allows them to exploit previously unused computational power for calculations that can be divided easily into smaller operations, such as Mandelbrot maps. The setup of an Xgrid cluster can be achieved at next to no cost, as Xgrid client is pre-installed on all computers running <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X 10.4 to <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X 10.7. The Xgrid client {{was not included in}} <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X 10.8. The Xgrid controller, the job scheduler of the Xgrid operation, is also included within <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server and as a free download from Apple. Apple has kept the command-line job control mechanism minimalist while providing an API to develop more sophisticated tools built around it.|$|E
5|$|A port of No One Lives Forever – Game of the Year Edition for the <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X {{operating}} system {{was developed by}} MumboJumbo, and published by MacPlay. It was released on November 21, 2002, soon after the original Windows release of No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way (which was also ported to <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X by MacPlay later). Similarly to the Windows version of the game, the <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X port also uses GameSpy technology for its online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play with each other, no matter which platform they use.|$|E

5|$|Apple modeled {{the design}} of Xgrid on the Zilla program, {{distributed}} with NeXT's OPENSTEP operating system application programming interface (API), which Apple owned the rights to. The company also opted to provide the client version of <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X with only command-line functions and little flexibility, while giving the <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> X Server version of Xgrid a GUI control panel and {{a full set of}} features.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of unusual}} changes {{required}} for the classic <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> environment, a special port called MacPerl was shipped independently.|$|E
