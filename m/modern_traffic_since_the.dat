50|$|The Ailesbury Park end of {{the avenue}} has been closed to road <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. The avenue was {{formerly}} spelt Sidney Parade Avenue.|$|R
50|$|The station served {{primarily}} mineral <b>traffic.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning of}} the 20th century, {{there has been an}} almost continuously-operated station restaurant.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} officially opened on 24 August 2013 {{and has been}} open to <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> morning of 26 August 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The {{historic}} Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge runs {{directly over}} the District. [...] The area has seen increased <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> bridge reopened as the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park in October 2009.|$|R
50|$|Its {{recent history}} {{has seen it}} as a {{prominent}} outpost of western luxury shops. Ginza is a popular destination on weekends, when the main north-south artery is closed to <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, under governor Ryokichi Minobe.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two tracks, but in December 2008, only track 1 {{was used by}} {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> crossing in Ratzeburg has been reactivated and trains now cross there. Freight traffic only occasionally uses the line.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} no longer served by long-distance <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{introduction}} of the Interregio line from Stuttgart via Würzburg and Schweinfurt to Erfurt in 2001. It still has an important role, however, in regional and local rail services.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{a large number of}} smaller {{stations}} that are important for local passenger <b>traffic.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s, the Westbahnhof and Südbahnhof have handled all long-distance travel. Many trains also stop at Hütteldorf or Meidling, especially when inbound.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} {{occasionally}} criticised {{as a source}} of environmental noise and pollution and strict noise abatement procedures have been enforced for departing <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s, while arriving traffic is generally routed to approach the field from the east, clear of Sofia.|$|R
50|$|Glebe Road intersects {{through several}} {{areas that have}} seen an {{increase}} in pedestrian <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Arlington County and local citizens started discussions on improving pedestrian safety in 2003; the implementation of these started in 2013 and is scheduled to complete in 2014.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the BAU value {{is in fact the}} upper limit of the respective throughput. Apparently, when BAU is higher than the required bandwidth, then the residual bandwidth becomes available to the lower priority traffic. At this point, the proportional distribution of resources also becomes clear. Specifically, (14) and (19) reveal that according to AWPP, the HP traffic deserves 4 times more bandwidth than <b>the</b> MP <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> former's priority is higher by 2, the priority factor equals 2, and they exhibit the same rate, whereas the HP traffic deserves 32 times more bandwidth than <b>the</b> LP <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> former's priority is higher by 6, the priority factor equals 2, and the latter exhibits 2 times higher rate.|$|R
30|$|These {{conclusions}} remain valid also {{in case of}} non-saturated BE <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> BE <b>traffic</b> {{does not}} influence the nrtPS packet delay. This {{is due to the}} applied capacity allocation rule, in which the nrtPS traffic has priority over the BE traffic at the same SS.|$|R
40|$|Wavelength routing [1, 2] has {{recently}} seen a remarkable upsurge in interest {{as a potential}} transport technology for IP <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>traffic</b> demand of the Internet and other data services is growing exponentially. This is happening in parallel to the shift away from circuit switched transport networ...|$|R
50|$|In 1920, some trains running between Saarbrücken and Homburg {{continued}} {{over the}} Glan Valley Railway to Bad Münster am Stein or Kusel. The annexation of the Saar area by Germany in 1935 caused an upsurge in local <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> train trips {{no longer had}} to be broken in Homburg.|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte Southern Rail Road {{is a short}} line {{railroad}} {{operating in}} Michigan. [...] It connects Charlotte, Michigan, with the CN rail system. It is a freight system, but its main customer has not received rail <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s. It is operated by the Adrian and Blissfield Rail Road Company.|$|R
50|$|The General Sullivan Bridge is a deck truss bridge, with a {{through truss}} span to {{accommodate}} ship traffic, that formerly carried the roads that now travel over the Little Bay Bridge. Completed in 1935, the bridge {{has been closed}} to vehicle <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> opening of the second Little Bay span in 1984.|$|R
50|$|MG Road in Thiruvananthapuram is {{the largest}} road {{in the state of}} Kerala in terms of size and <b>traffic.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> MG Road is the longest and widest road in Kerala, it {{naturally}} has many junctions. In total the road passes through main 10 / 11 (Palayam is even divided into 2 more junctions) junctions.|$|R
50|$|Telstar was {{the first}} {{communications}} satellite to provide commercial transatlantic communications. It was launched by on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch. Communications satellites vastly increased the speed and quality of transatlantic communication, but transatlantic fiber optic cables have carried {{the vast majority of}} transatlantic communications <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway was {{incorporated}} in 1846. The Hereford {{section of the}} line officially opened at Barrs Court Station on 6 December 1853, although the line had been used for goods <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> earlier in the year. It was leased jointly by the LNWR and GWR from 1862 and was transferred to joint ownership in 1868.|$|R
50|$|KFRG {{had been}} {{focusing}} more on Orange County and Los Angeles area news and <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> demise of KZLA, but on February 23, 2007, KKGO moved its Country format and call letters to its FM sister station, thus bringing a full-powered FM Country music station back the nation's second largest radio market after a six-month absence.|$|R
50|$|Maiden Wells has {{suffered}} with very heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1960s when the Texaco (now Valero) oil refinery and Pembroke Power Station opened. Even though the road through Maiden Wells is a C-road designed for light traffic, by 2015 around six thousand vehicles a day were {{passing through the}} village including many vans, lorries and oil tankers.|$|R
5000|$|Ormond {{has been}} engaged in {{fighting}} human <b>trafficking</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s, and in 2006 [...] partnered with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to double her efforts. She is also an advocate for Transatlantic Partners Against Aids, which attempts to raise awareness about AIDS in Russia and Ukraine, and is founding co-chairman of FilmAid International.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1839, the Red River was not navigable {{from just}} north of Natchitoches {{to what is now}} Shreveport, due to the Great Raft, a natural logjam which had {{prevented}} river <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> beginning of American exploration of the Louisiana Territory. The Bradleys found a route northward, making it to the place now known as Bradley, Arkansas ...|$|R
50|$|There {{was almost}} no {{livestock}} <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> area has no tradition of stockbreeding. Twenty-two cattle were carried in the EKLR's lifetime. In 1935 336 pigs were carried and in 1936 353, which looks like the establishment or liquidation (or both, in quick succession) of a pig farm. Some wool was carried, because sheep were used to keep the grass down in orchards.|$|R
50|$|In the boroughs of Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension and Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Saint Denis Street {{is mainly}} residential. However, several {{businesses}} including green grocers and Vietnamese restaurants {{are located on}} the street. It {{is also one of}} the gateways to the Metropolitan Expressway. North of Crémazie Boulevard, it is a one-way northbound street with little <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> northbound Highway 335 continues along the Lajeunesse Street and Berri Street.|$|R
50|$|State Road 932’s {{connection}} with the Palmetto Expressway has similarly evolved from a little-used at-grade intersection in the early-1960s to a diamond interchange in the 1970s that was often overwhelmed in the 1990s and augmented by a flyover ramp in the 2000s. In contrast to the now-congested western end, {{the eastern end of}} SR 932 hasn’t seen significant change in <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a dam was planned but never realised. As a result the Sieber valley is the only unregulated river valley in the western Harz. The upper Sieber valley has been out-of-bounds to motor <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1980s from the Forsthaus Königshof and lies partly within the Harz National Park - the road leads to the B 242 federal highway northwest of Sonnenberg.|$|R
50|$|Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (born 1930 or 1942), {{commonly}} referred to by his alias Don Neto, is a convicted Mexican drug lord and former leader of the Guadalajara Cartel, an extinct criminal group based in Jalisco. He headed the organization alongside Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and Rafael Caro Quintero. Fonseca Carrillo was involved with drug <b>trafficking</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s, primarily in Ecuador, but later moved his operations to Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Constable Hook is a cape {{located on}} the north side of the outlet of Kill van Kull into Upper New York Bay in Bayonne, New Jersey.The cape has long been an {{important}} site of marine transfer operations in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Just offshore, Robbins Reef Light serves to guide harbor <b>traffic.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> late 20th century, brownfields have been repurposed for recreational and commercial uses.|$|R
5000|$|Mexico {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} countries in the world for journalists, particularly those that cover reports on organized crime and drug <b>trafficking.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> year 2000, nearly 100 journalists, writers, and bloggers have been slain or abducted, and most of the crimes remain unsolved. The journalists who are believed to be [...] "disappeared" [...] are usually never found, but they are sometimes presumed dead or kidnapped.|$|R
50|$|The {{management}} system introduced by Kamenshchik made Domodedovo Airport {{number one in}} Russia in terms of passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> 2005; <b>the</b> airport was listed among Europe's major airports in 2011.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{the queue}} {{model of the}} {{secondary}} user will be introduced with a complete analysis for the transition probabilities and the average power consumed for Models I and II of <b>the</b> primary user’s <b>traffic.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> primary user is assumed to transmit its packets instantaneously, we will focus only on the queue of the secondary user. We assume in this section that neither power control nor retransmission of collided packets is allowed.|$|R
50|$|The McEwen Bridge, {{spanning}} the Humber River {{in the city}} of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, is listed as a property of interest to Cultural Services Division. The bowstring arch bridge, carrying Kirby Road, was completed in 1923. Closed to vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s, it presently forms a part of the Humber Valley Heritage Trail. The bridge is currently in an advanced state of disrepair; a decision on its rehabilitation is pending.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{had fallen}} {{into a state of}} {{disrepair}} by 2010, when plans were being developed to reconstruct Continental Avenue and the bridge. During the reconstruction of the bridge it was decided that {{there was no need for}} it to carry vehicular <b>traffic,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> nearby Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge was completed in 2012 to do so. The design as a footbridge complemented the nearby open park plan for Klyde Warren Park, as a recreation amenity.|$|R
50|$|It {{primarily}} {{serves the}} needs of international long distance <b>traffic,</b> but <b>since</b> <b>the</b> reintroduction of regional traffic on the line it is again of regional importance for Fehmarn.|$|R
50|$|Quezon Avenue {{starts from}} the Mabuhay Rotunda and {{ends in the}} Elliptical Road. It {{is one of the}} most {{important}} thoroughfares of Quezon City. It runs through the center of the city, lined with palm trees, government buildings, and nightclubs. It uses an interchange system on most of its intersections. This road used to be one of the most comfortable roads in the area, but had been extremely prone to heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> construction of the G. Araneta Avenue Underpass.|$|R
