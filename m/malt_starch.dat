40|$|Real {{degree of}} {{fermentation}} (RDF) {{is an important}} measure of brewhouse performance {{in the production of}} beer. In this work, the relationship of RDF with <b>malted</b> barley <b>starch</b> properties was investigated. Starches were isolated from 25 malted barley samples and analyzed for molecular size distribution (by HPSEC), AP structural features (by high-performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering and RI detectors), and thermal properties (by DSC). Cluster analysis, analysis of variance, principal component analysis, bivariate correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis were used in establish-ing correlations. RDF, AM, and AP content were 74. 0 – 80. 1 %, 25. 2 – 34. 4 %, and 65. 6 – 74. 9 %, respectively. Starch gelatinization enthalpy was 6. 4 – 8. 1 J/g, and onset gelatinization temperature was 58. 5 – 64. 38 C. AP and AM content had a positive and negative impact on RDF, respectively. The effect of thermal properties (starch gelatinization and AM-lipid com-plex melting) on RDF was not clear.

The resultsindicated that starch saccharification provided a higher ethanol yield (48. 38 g/ 100 g sugar consumed) than SSF. In addition,the efficiency of ethanol fermentation was 67 % which {{is similar to that of}} the malted rice made from normal paddy (68 %).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Five sorghum varieties, Dorado, Malisor 84 - 7, Tortillero, ATx 630 *R 3338, and ATx 623 *SC 1 03 were malted according to standard procedures and monitored for <b>malting</b> quality and <b>starch</b> modification during a 5 day malting period. Dry matter losses (DML) and (x-and B-amylase activities increased with longer germination time. After 5 days of malting, ot-and B-amylase activities were highest in Dorado and lowest in Malisor 84 - 7. (x-Amylase activity in Dorado was 70 % and B-amylase activity was 65 % of a commercial barley <b>malt</b> reference. <b>Starch</b> decreased and enzyme susceptible starch increased with longer germination time. Apparent starch loss was highly correlated with DML and a-and B-amylase activities. The amount of soluble amylopectin at 850 C decreased during malting for all varieties. The amount of soluble amylopectin at 1200 C decreased for all normal endosperm varieties during germination. Malting increased the proportion of starch soluble at 1200 and 850 C. Dextrins (MW 3. 0 X 1 03 to 6. 1 X 103) developed during malting in all varieties. After 5 days of malting, dextrin content ranged from 19. 5 % (Dorado) to 5. 1 % (Malisor 84 - 7) Dextrin development was delayed in Malisor 84 - 7 and Tortillero until germination day 1 or 2. ATx 630 *R 3338 produced significantly more dextrins during the germination period. Dextrin content of the commercial barley malt was 15. 6 %. Total sugars (DP 1 to DP 6) increased during malting. After 5 days of malting, ATx 623 *SC 1 03 had the highest amount of sugars (1 1. 6 %) and Malisor 847 had the lowest amount of sugars (6. 6 %). A commercial barley malt sample contained 10. 6 % sugars. Sucrose and glucose were the predominant sugars detected in malt. Enzyme activity, endosperm composition (normal versus waxy), and endosperm hardness affect the modification of <b>starch</b> during <b>malting.</b> Few changes in the starch profile were seen in Malisor 84 - 7 during malting possibly due to low enzyme activities. ATx 623 *SC 1 03 (soft, normal endosperm) and ATx 630 *R 3338 (intermediate, waxy endosperm) were able to mobilize starch and accumulate lower molecular weight carbohydrates more efficiently than Dorado although enzyme activities were not as high...|$|R
