50|$|Disability {{fraud is}} {{the receipt of}} payment(s) {{intended}} for the disabled from a government agency or private insurance company by one who should not be receiving them, or the receipt of a higher amount than one who is entitled to them should be receiving. There are various acts that may constitute disability fraud. These include feigning a <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> {{in order to be}} declared disabled, exaggeration of an existing <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> that potentially can but in reality does not render the person disabled, continuing to receive payments after having recovered from a <b>medical</b> <b>problem,</b> or continuing to receive payments while working (usually unreported) above the allowable level for those receiving the payments.|$|R

Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other <b>medical</b> <b>problems.</b> It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other <b>medical</b> <b>problems.</b> Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases.

A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E

5|$|The <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of {{the ancient}} Egyptians stemmed {{directly}} from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued {{the transformation of}} the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first pathogen-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{his wife}} had moved to Somerset. In 1940, {{she gave birth to}} a son, Euan, who had many <b>medical</b> <b>problems,</b> and in 1943 she bore a third daughter, Iona. The {{pressure}} of running the household and caring for Euan led Isla to have a nervous breakdown after Iona's birth. When Jardine returned from the war, the family moved to Radlett to be closer to London. Isla recovered and Jardine found a job with paper manufacturers Wiggins Teape. In 1946, Jardine was chosen to play for Old England in a popular and successful fund raising match against Surrey. He displayed much of his old batting skill but did not show much involvement with his team-mates. By 1948, Jardine was more accepted in the cricket world. This was partly due to English perception of the short-pitched fast bowling of Australian pairing Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller as being hostile. England's poor performance in the 1946–47 and 1948 Ashes also caused writers to remember Jardine more fondly as an icon of past English success.|$|E
5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E
