Although virgin polyethylene has better mechanical properties than once and twice recycled polyethylene, but with the addition of sawdust as filler consisting of recycled polyethylene composites mechanical properties significantly higher than that virgin polyethylene.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{molecular}} weight distribution curves of several commercial polyethylene samples were evaluated by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography with two detectors (a refractive-index detector and a viscome-ter) to determine the molecular sizes and architectures (branching). The polymer samples included high- and low-density polyethylenes with different {{molecular weight}} dis-tributions (wide, medium, unimodal, and bimodal) from nine producers. The results were tested against the <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>index</b> and zero-shear <b>melt</b> viscosity to find correla-tions. The data for high-density polyethylene correlated well with the molecular weight, whereas the data for low-density polyethylene did not correlate. However, when the weight-average molecular weight was corrected by the branching parameter and a factor form, all the polyethylene samples fit a single equation. These {{results indicate that the}} <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>index</b> is dependent not only on the mole-cular weight but also on the molecular shape, including branching. The relation accounted for samples of different resin producers, molecular weights (65, 000 – 638, 000), and polydispersities (2. 9 – 20).

Some applications require the incorporation of a reinforcement material to produce a composite with specific properties.

40|$|Metamaterial {{behavior}} of polymer nanocomposites (NCs) based on isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was investigated {{based on the}} observation of a negative dielectric constant (ε′). It is demonstrated that as the dielectric constant switches from negative to positive, the plasma frequency (ωp) depends strongly on the ultrasound-assisted fabrication method, {{as well as on}} the <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>index</b> of the iPP. NCs were fabricated using ultrasound-assisted extrusion methods with 10 wt % loadings of MWCNTs in iPPs with different <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indices</b> (MFI). AC electrical conductivity (σ(AC)) as a function of frequency was determined to complement the electrical classification of the NCs, which were previously designated as insulating (I), static-dissipative (SD), and conductive (C) materials. It was found that the SD and C materials can also be classified as metamaterials (M). This type of behavior emerges from the negative dielectric constant observed at low frequencies although, at certain frequencies, the dielectric constant becomes positive. Our method of fabrication allows for the preparation of metamaterials with tunable ωp. iPP pure samples show only positive dielectric constants.

The blends and pure materials were exposed for periods of up to 15 weeks of UV irradiation; their mechanical properties (tensile and impact), fracture surface, and <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indices</b> were monitored. After 3 weeks of UV exposure, all of the materials presented mechanical properties of the same order of magnitude. However, for times of exposure greater than 3 weeks, an increasing concentration of HIPS resulted in a better photostability of PP.

It was more difficult to measure the <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>index</b> of the binary PP/HIPS blends than that of PP for low concentrations of HIPS; this was most likely due to energy transfer between the blend domains during photodegradation.
