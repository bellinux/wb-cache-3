5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E

5|$|Macroolithus is an oogenus (fossil-egg genus) of dinosaur egg {{belonging}} to the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. The type oospecies, M. rugustus, was originally described under the now-defunct oogenus name Oolithes. Three other oospecies are known: M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. They are relatively large, elongated eggs with a two-layered eggshell. Their nests consist of large, concentric rings of paired eggs. There is evidence of blue-green pigmentation in its shell, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> camouflage the nests.|$|E
5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to preserve their integrity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of incentives—monetary or {{non-monetary}} compensation offered to children so that an educational need is fulfilled or perceived cost is brought down—in attaining certain expected educational enrolment and retention outcomes. It draws on a survey conducted in six villages in Gujarat. Incentives themselves may not be that critical in improving access and retention performance; other socio-economic and school-related factors may be more significant in ensuring access and retention. However, incentives <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>help</b> in keeping the poorer performers in school. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others have denied this connection. Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to retain their structural integrity..|$|E
5|$|Alexander was {{probably}} at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate John of Crema, and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He {{was still in}} Rome in 1126, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of Malmesbury Abbey, Abbotsbury Abbey, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander {{had a number of}} clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were Ralph Gubion, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Calais was {{virtually}} razed {{to the ground}} during World War II. In May 1940, it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became {{the scene of a}} last-ditch defence—the Siege of Calais—which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk. 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk, as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter had it not been busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Foliot (c.1110– 18 February 1187) was {{a medieval}} English monk and prelate, {{successively}} Abbot of Gloucester, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, {{he became a}} monk at Cluny Abbey in France at {{about the age of}} twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to fabricate some charters—legal deeds attesting property ownership—to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Italian {{story was}} also in simple rhymed verse, and {{seems to have been}} about a beautiful maiden called Biancofiore - Whiteflower, or Blanche - and her brave hero, Captain Rinaldo, and Ricardo and his paladins - the term used for Christian knights engaged in Crusades against the Saracens and Moore. Against these good people are the wicked Moors - North African Muslims and Arabs - and their Sultan. The catalyst for victory seems to have been the magician called Urlubulu, who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>help</b> from a mother hen and her chickens, possibly also magic. Clearly the English translators, using the original illustrations, and the basic rhyme patterns, have slightly simplified the plot, and eliminated the Christians-versus-Muslim-Moors conflict, replacing it with gold versus green.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{due to the}} Quaker {{influence}} in Philadelphia, the [...] "Philadelphia Tea Party" [...] was relatively nonviolent and did not cause loss to any innocent merchants, since no tea was destroyed. In fact, local merchants <b>may</b> <b>have</b> even <b>helped</b> Captain Ayres with his expenses in returning to England.|$|R
5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} {{from his native}} city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E
5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E
5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E
