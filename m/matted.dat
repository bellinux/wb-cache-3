5|$|A <b>matted</b> surface; {{the note}} paper {{is made out}} of pure cotton, which feels crisp and firm, but not limp or waxy.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled <b>matted</b> locks) or with jatamandala (<b>matted</b> hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his <b>matted</b> hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a <b>matted</b> area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the <b>matted</b> image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the <b>matted</b> image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, Dhumavati rides a crow {{and holds}} a trident. She may be {{depicted}} wearing a garland of severed heads, with red-coloured limbs and <b>matted</b> but dishevelled hair. Sometimes, she carries the buffalo-horn of Yama, {{the god of}} death, symbolizing her association with death.|$|E
5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They basically constitute of <b>matted</b> vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached {{from the bottom of}} the lake and drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.|$|E
5|$|The 8th-century saint Cuntarar {{described}} Bhikshatana {{as having}} <b>matted</b> {{hair and skin}} smeared with ash, and wearing bark clothes and a tiger skin around his waist. He added that Bhikshatana would roam begging for food by day and dance at night {{in front of a}} fire, in company of his wife and several jackals.|$|E
5|$|The iconographical {{attributes}} of Shiva are the serpent around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his <b>matted</b> hair, the third eye on his forehead, the trishula as his weapon and the damaru. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of Lingam. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus, in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} change in effects companies, Yuricich {{continued}} to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film, having previously worked on The Day the Earth Stood Still, Ben-Hur, North by Northwest and Logan's Run. The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the frame was <b>matted</b> out; the blue Earth sky over Yellowstone, for example was replaced with a red-hued Vulcan landscape. More than 100 such paintings were used.|$|E
5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing <b>matted</b> hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared {{in the image of}} Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with <b>matted</b> or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and <b>matted</b> sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under <b>matted</b> vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in five to eight months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage <b>matted</b> {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
5|$|This trek was {{the first}} {{recorded}} crossing of the mountainous island, completed without tents, sleeping bags, or map—their only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter's adze, a length of alpine rope, and screws from the James Caird hammered through their boots to serve as crampons. They arrived at the whaling station at Stromness, tired and dirty, hair long and <b>matted,</b> faces blackened by months of cooking by blubber stoves—"the world's dirtiest men", according to Worsley. They quickly organized a boat {{to pick up the}} three {{on the other side of}} South Georgia, but thereafter it took Shackleton three months and four attempts by ship to rescue the other 22men still on Elephant Island.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of <b>matted</b> vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a <b>matted</b> lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, CenturyLink Field {{became the}} first stadium in the NFL to install a FieldTurf {{artificial}} field. The surface is made of plastic fibers rooted {{in a mixture of}} ground rubber and sand. The field was replaced in the spring of 2008 after tests showed that compression of the sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries. FieldTurf won the bid for the second installation over Polytan. For the replacement surface, a one-inch (two and one-half centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First & Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed. By 2010 the FieldTurf's quality had decreased with the blades becoming <b>matted</b> down. It also failed FIFA's quality testing to be ranked 2 Star. A new FieldTurf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 Star field after testing.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with <b>matted</b> hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (<b>matted</b> hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely <b>matted</b> tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and <b>matted</b> sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Ardhanarishvara {{originated}} in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography {{evolved in the}} Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE). A mid-first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with Vishnu, Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera. The male half is ithyphallic or with an urdhvalinga and makes an abhaya mudra gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized. An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum. The right male half has <b>matted</b> hair with a skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (earring). The face has a common third eye. A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half-man, half-woman features. Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.|$|E
5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, <b>matted</b> hair) on his head, {{adorned with}} a {{crescent}} moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes {{the shape of the}} halo may differ on either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny <b>matted</b> hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E
5|$|Wrapped {{on one of}} {{the arms}} of Shiva is his iconic coiling serpent whose hood is seen near his left shoulder. Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of <b>matted</b> hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his lower torso, below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with {{ornaments}} and jewellery. Between them stands a gana (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In the lower left of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in namaste posture representing the heroic mythical king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.|$|E
5|$|In the Padma Purana, {{the curse}} of the sages fails. In retribution, Shiva casts a curse on the sages so that they, like Bhikshatana, will become beggars with <b>matted</b> hair and be devoid of knowledge. Those who would still worship him would gain knowledge, wealth, and progeny, and be reborn into good families. In the Skanda Purana, the sages of the Deodar Forest are {{performing}} rituals and start {{to think of themselves as}} gods. To humble these arrogant sages, Shiva takes the form of Bhikshatana—an attractive young beggar—and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, the women wildly chase Shiva. When the sages regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger), and a dwarf, all of which attack Shiva, who overpowers them. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer. The same legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some differences. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja. The ceiling of the Shivakamasundari shrine in the Nataraja temple complex illustrates this legend in a series of frescos, where Bhikshatana is depicted as a white naked mendicant accompanied by a scantily-scad Mohini.|$|E
5|$|The snails mate from May through July, and {{lay eggs}} from June through July. They are hermaphroditic; however, {{it is unclear}} if self-fertilization is possible. The eggs, {{numbering}} 8 to 14, are approximately 2mm in diameter, spherical, transparent, and very distinctive within a cluster. Generally, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not {{found to have a}} heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster, which is associated with egg masses of Succinea sp. B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants, under <b>matted</b> vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. The young snails hatch in 2 to 3 weeks, measuring barely 2mm. It is still unclear when the snails mature, although Grimm (1981) believes they reach maturity in five to eight months, or the spring following hatching. At the end of their first full year of growth, snails observed by Aloi and Ringler (1982) averaged around 10mm. By the end of the following year, the adult snails were observed to reach a length of approximately 21mm; they then die, completing a life span of about 2.5 years. This life span is similar to those in captive populations (Rosamond Gifford Zoo, unpublished data).|$|E

25|$|For {{purposes}} of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows {{one of two}} general models—annual plasticulture, or a perennial system of <b>matted</b> rows or mounds. Greenhouses produce {{a small amount of}} strawberries during the off season.|$|E
25|$|Wool {{comes from}} domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool {{and it is}} the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been {{recovered}} from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not <b>matted,</b> while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.|$|E
25|$|The pitch {{was made}} of a <b>matted</b> couch grass and was very spongy and soft. It was a slow pitch that favoured the bowlers. The ground was {{the home of the}} Albert Club, one of the most {{powerful}} in Sydney, which could boast three teams of 11. The club’s players wore white caps and pants and blue shirts and counted amongst their number the greatest bowler of the day ‘The Demon’ Fred Spofforth.|$|E
25|$|The Mission San Juan Bautista, where Madeleine {{falls from}} the tower, is a real place, but the tower had to be <b>matted</b> in with a {{painting}} using studio effects; Hitchcock had first visited the mission before the tower was torn down due to dry rot, and was reportedly displeased to find it missing {{when he returned to}} film his scenes. The original tower was much smaller and less dramatic than the film's version.|$|E
