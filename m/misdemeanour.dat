5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a <b>misdemeanour</b> or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E

The failure of the bill led to Palmerston's resignation as Prime Minister and the general election of 1859.|$|E

25|$|The High Court and the Court of Appeal are {{empowered}} by section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to punish for contempt of court. In a 1991 case, the High Court held {{that this was}} statutory recognition of the common law <b>misdemeanour</b> of contempt of court. The Subordinate Courts' power to punish acts of contempt can be found principally in two statutes, section 8 of the Subordinate Courts Act, and section 410 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.|$|E

The 2009 amendment of the language law restricts the use of minority languages, and extends the obligatory use of the state language (e.g. in communities where the number of minority speakers is less than 20% of the population). Under the 2009 amendment a fine of up to 5000 euros may be imposed on those committing a <b>misdemeanour</b> {{in relation to the}} use of the state language.|$|E

25|$|Bradman {{spent much}} of his solitary time on the tour writing as he had sold the rights to a book. Serialised in London's The Star during August, Don Bradman's Book was {{published}} in November 1930. It was a modest work of 50,000 words with a few pages of tips as an appendix. The Board of Control ruled that the serialised extracts of his book were a technical breach of his tour contract, which banned players from writing about the game. The dispute was widely covered by the press, most of which was supportive of Bradman. However, he was fined £50 for the <b>misdemeanour</b> on 29 December 1930.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 2014, Bieber {{was charged}} with one <b>misdemeanour</b> count of {{vandalism}} in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January. Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown. With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{masturbation}} in {{the sight}} of others is prosecuted under a general law such as public indecency, though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors. In the US, laws vary from state to state. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Alabama upheld a state law criminalizing the distribution of sex-toys. In the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, masturbating in public is a class 3 <b>misdemeanour.</b> In 2013, a man found masturbating openly on a beach in Sweden was cleared of charges of sexual assault, the court finding that his activities had not been directed towards any specific person.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{criminal}} offence under cantonal and federal law to wilfully cause one's taxes to be incompletely assessed. The statutes distinguish, however, between tax evasion and tax fraud. Tax evasion is the act of causing a tax to be falsely assessed, such as through the failure to report taxable income. It is classed as a <b>misdemeanour</b> (Übertretung / contravention) and is punishable by a fine of 33% to 300% {{of the amount of}} tax evaded. Tax fraud, on the other hand, occurs if a tax evasion is committed by using false documents (such as untrue corporate financial reports) for deceptive purposes. It is classed as a crime (Vergehen / crime) and is punishable by additional imprisonment of up to three years or an additional fine of up to 30,000 CHF.|$|E

Johnson's uncle, Edgar Charles Rossell, {{who had won}} the Military Cross with the Royal Fusiliers in 1916, paid for Johnson's {{education}} at Loughborough.
