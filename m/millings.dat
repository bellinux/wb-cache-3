500|$|Besides Morrison, {{there is}} {{conflicting}} information about {{who participated in}} the session. In addition to the group's original members (guitarist Billy Harrison, bassist Alan Henderson, drummer Ronnie <b>Millings,</b> and keyboard player Eric Wrixon), others have been suggested: Pat McAuley on keyboards, Bobby Graham on a second drum kit, Jimmy Page on second guitar, and Peter Bardens on keyboards. As Page biographer George Case notes, [...] "There is a dispute over whether it is Page's piercing blues line that defines the song, if he only played a run Harrison had already devised, or if Page only backed up Harrison himself". Morrison has acknowledged Page's participation in the early sessions: [...] "He played rhythm guitar on one thing and doubled a bass riff on the other" [...] and Morrison biographer Johnny Rogan notes that Page [...] "doubled the distinctive riff already worked out by Billy Harrison". Music critic Greil Marcus comments that during the song's quieter middle passage [...] "the guitarist, session player Jimmy Page or not, seems to be feeling his way into another song, flipping half-riffs, high, random, distracted metal shavings". Them's blues-rock arrangement is [...] "now regarded justly as definitive", with [...] "much of its appeal emanat from the tingling lead guitar section", according to music writer Adam Clayson.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{said that}} he wrote [...] "Gloria" [...] while he {{performed}} with the Monarchs in Germany {{in the summer of}} 1963, at just about the time he turned 18 years old. He started to perform it at the Maritime Hotel when he returned to Belfast and joined up with the Gamblers to form the band Them. He would ad-lib lyrics as he performed, sometimes stretching the song to 15 or 20 minutes. After signing a contract with Dick Rowe and Decca, Them went to London for a recording session at Decca Three Studios in West Hampstead on 5 April 1964; [...] "Gloria" [...] was one of the seven songs recorded that day. Besides Morrison, present were Billy Harrison on guitar, Alan Henderson on bass, Ronnie <b>Millings</b> on drums and Patrick John McCauley on keyboards. Rowe brought in session musicians Arthur Greenslade on organ and Bobby Graham on drums, since he considered the Them members too inexperienced. There remains some dispute about whether <b>Millings</b> and McCauley were miked up, but Alan Henderson contends that Them constituted the first rock group to use two drummers on a recording. Although some sources claim that Jimmy Page played second guitar, other sources deny this.|$|E
5000|$|Asphalt <b>millings</b> - Small {{pieces of}} asphalt {{produced}} by mechanically grinding asphalt surfaces {{are referred to}} as asphalt <b>millings.</b> Large <b>millings</b> that have a rich, black tint indicating a high asphalt cement content are best for asphalt recycling purposes. Surface <b>millings</b> are recommended over full depth <b>millings</b> when choosing asphalt <b>millings</b> to recycle. Full depth <b>millings</b> usually contain sub-base contaminants such as gravel, mud and sand. These sub base contaminants will leach oil away from original asphalt and dry out the material in the recycling process. Asphalt milled from asphalt is better than asphalt milled from concrete. When milling asphalt from concrete the dust that is created is not compatible with asphalt products because it is not asphalt.|$|E

Shield Rare-earth, high-energy {{permanent}} magnets are currently the best performing {{permanent magnets}} used today. The discovery of single domain magnetism in 1950 ’s {{ultimately led to}} the development of nanocomposite magnets which had superior magnetic properties. Previous work has shown that mechanical milling (MM) effectively generates nanoscale structures in Sm-Co-based alloys. MM of more Co-rich, melt-spun Sm-Co alloys (up to the eutectic composition) and the role of initial structure on the milling behavior were investigated. Sm-Co alloys with compositions of Sm 10. 5 Co 89. 5 and Sm 8 Co 92 were produced by arc melting, melt-spinning and mechanical milling. X-ray diffraction results showed that the as-melt spun materials formed in the disordered TbCu 7 -type variant for both compositions, and that FCC-Co is also present in Sm 8 Co 92. At long milling times, FCC-Co developed in the Sm 10. 5 Co 89. 5 alloy. MM resulted in a decrease of grain size, indicated by the broadening of the x-ray diffraction peaks. However, the samples remained crystalline, as peaks characteristic of the TbCu 7 -type structure were always present. The grain sizes obtained in both compositions ranged between 10 - 20 nm. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the powder particles contain agglomerates and that a broad micron-scale particle size exists in the samples. The coercivity of both samples initially increased with increasing milling time, reaching plateau values of ~ 4. 6 kOe and 1. 6 kOe for Sm 10. 5 Co 89. 5 and Sm 8 Co 92, respectively. The lower coercivity values of the Sm 8 Co 92 alloy were due to its more Co-rich composition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of tool axis inclination angles in ball-end milling. Tool axis inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the tool axis inclination angle in feed direction and also in pick feed direction. Also using climb milling or conventional milling has big influence on surface quality and on tool life. Keywords—CAD/CAM system, tool axis inclination angle, ballend milling, surface roughness, cutting forces.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of proteinaceous xylanase inhibitors in 1997 in whea t, three classes of such naturally occurring xylanase inhibiting protein s (XIs) were identified and purified from wheat, i. e. Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI), xylanase inhibiting protein (XIP) and thaumat in-like xylanase inhibitor (TLXI). The initial finding that XIs only inh ibit endo- 1, 4 -ß-D-xylanases (xylanases) of microbial origin, wherea s they do not interact with plant endogenous xylanases {{has led to the}} hy pothesis that XIs play a role in plant defence. They may limit pathogen invasion either by reducing the hydrolytic activity of the secreted xyla nases or by ensuring the generation of elicitor-active (arabino) xylo-oli gosaccharide fragments that might have been extensively degraded {{in the absence of the}} inhibitors. Elicitors in turn trigger subsequent plant de fence responses. In addition, XIs which make up a considerable part of the albumin/globul in fraction in wheat grains have a large impact on cereal-based applicat ions in which inhibitor-sensitive xylanases are used. Xylanases affect t he functionality of arabinoxylans by altering their physico-chemical pro perties and are applied as technical aids in cereal-based processes, as they can improve processing and product end-quality. The current study aimed to unravel the intercultivar, spatio-temporal an d pathogen induced distribution of the three known classes of polymorphi c XIs in the wheat proteome. A comprehensive view on the variability in TAXI, XIP and TLXI (iso) forms contributes to a more profound insight in their presumed role in plant protection and provides a stronger scientif ic basis to understand their impact on biotechnological applications. Using an antibody-based technique TAXI, XIP and TLXI protein levels were measured in different wheat cultivars and milling fractions. Although n o intercultivar correlation was discovered between the levels of the thr ee classes of XIs (showing two- to three-fold variations), their spatial distribution within the wheat grain was comparable. The highest TAXI, X IP and TLXI concentrations were found in the aleurone fraction. Immunobl otting and densitometric analysis also revealed that the three classes o f XIs accumulate in an analogous way during grain development and germin ation. The largest increases in TAXI, XIP and TLXI levels were observed from the milky to the soft dough stage of grain development, after which high levels were maintained until grain maturity. They further accumula ted in the developing seedlings up till 5 to 9 days post-imbibition. Whi le TLXI was found to be restricted to wheat grain tissues, TAXI and XIP also occurred in roots and shoots of the young seedlings. No detectable amounts of the three types of XIs were present in roots, leaves or stems at later stages of ear development. A proteomic approach, using 2 D gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and mass spect rometry (MS) revealed the existence of polymorphic families of XIs in wh eat grains, comprising different genetic variants as well as post-transl ationally modified forms. Thereby, a link was provided between data on t he genomic and proteomic levels. Some XI isoforms corresponding to putat ive genes, for which it was not yet known if they are actually expressed in wheat grains, were identified. Other genetic variants were not detec ted and may only be transcribed in other wheat plant parts or under othe r (stress) conditions. The intercultivar, temporal and pathogen induced variability of these po lymorphic XI families was assessed in detail by the combined use of 2 -DE /MS and difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) technology. Differences in XI levels between wheat cultivars could be attributed to various ind ividual differences in the multiple (iso) forms, in which they occur. The similarity in abundance between some XI (iso) forms and several chitinas es may well point to co-regulation of their expression. Early in grain d evelopment the XI polymorphism was found to be less pronounced than at t he harvest ripe stage. Fusarium graminearum &# 8710;Tri 5 infection o f wheat grains at anthesis resulted in enhanced, reduced as well as unch anged levels of specific XI forms. This is in line with earlier results on the transcriptomic level. The disease effect was mostly visible soon after inoculation (5 days post-anthesis). XI levels at the harvest ripe stage are possibly not affected. In general, the results obtained in this doctoral dissertation provide a dditional evidence for the presumed plant protective role of the three c lasses of XIs. The accumulation of XIs at later stages of grain developm ent and their persistence throughout the early stages of germination are consistent with a defensive function, in particular for the young wheat seedling, which is highly susceptible to pathogen attack. Their locatio n within the wheat kernel, showing high concentrations in aleurone and p eripheral layers, contributes to this hypothesis. Besides their spatio-t emporal distribution, also the large polymorphism of XIs fits well with their suggested role as plant defence-related proteins. A XI population showing distinct recognition specificities towards xylanases might be th e result of plant evolution to counteract the many xylanases secreted by bacteria and fungi, analogous to polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins in dicots. Finally, the abundance of some XI forms was found to be induc ed in response to F. graminearum &# 8710;Tri 5 infection, while that of others was repressed or remained constant. It can be assumed that som e XI genes are constitutively expressed while others are inducible by bi otic or abiotic stresses. The basal level of the various XI (iso) forms i s probably cultivar-, tissue- and time-specific. However, the exact quan titative and qualititative composition of the heterogenous XI population under certain circumstances additionally depends upon the pathogen or s tress encountered, the site of infestation and the signaling pathway inv olved.

50|$|Cold in-place recycling. Bituminous {{pavement}} {{is ground}} or milled into small particles. The asphalt <b>millings</b> are blended {{with a small amount}} of asphalt emulsion or foamed bitumen, paved and compacted, allowed to cure for seven to ten days, then overlaid with asphalt.|$|E
50|$|Longbridge Mill is a {{restored}} water mill {{situated on the}} River Loddon {{in the village of}} Sherfield on Loddon in the English county of Hampshire. The mill is now incorporated into a public house and restaurant, but is still occasionally used for demonstration <b>millings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Millings' {{shop was}} located on 63 Old Compton Street [...] in Soho and began {{designing}} for British pop {{stars such as}} Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele, and Adam Faith in the early 1960s and made the collarless suits the Beatles wore on their first American tour in 1964 {{as well as the}} stage suits for the movie Help!. <b>Millings</b> made more than 500 outfits for the band.|$|E
50|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt <b>millings,</b> diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills. The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National Asphalt Pavement Association.|$|E
5000|$|On April 20, 1915, U.S. Signal Corps Officers Byron Q. Jones and Thomas <b>Millings</b> flew a Martin T.O. Curtiss {{over the}} fort to spot {{movements}} of Mexican Revolutionary leader Francisco [...] "Pancho" [...] Villa. The plane reached {{an altitude of}} 2,600 ft. and was up for 20 minutes. It did not cross the border into Mexico, although it was fired upon by machine guns and small arms. These frequent patrols lasted {{for a period of}} 6 weeks and were used more effectively in 1916.|$|E
5000|$|Morrison {{said that}} he wrote [...] "Gloria" [...] while he {{performed}} with the Monarchs in Germany {{in the summer of}} 1963, at just about the time he turned eighteen years old. He started to perform it at the Maritime Hotel when he returned to Belfast and joined up with the Gamblers to form the band Them. He would ad-lib lyrics as he performed, sometimes stretching the song to fifteen or twenty minutes. After signing a contract with Dick Rowe and Decca, Them went to London for a recording session at Decca Three Studios in West Hampstead on 5 April 1964; [...] "Gloria" [...] was one of the seven songs recorded that day. Besides Morrison, present were Billy Harrison on guitar, Alan Henderson on bass, Ronnie <b>Millings</b> on drums and Patrick John McCauley on keyboards. Rowe brought in session musicians Arthur Greenslade on organ and Bobby Graham on drums, since he considered the Them members too inexperienced. There remains some dispute about whether <b>Millings</b> and McCauley were miked up, but Alan Henderson contends that Them constituted the first rock group to use two drummers on a recording. Although some sources claim that Jimmy Page played second guitar, other sources deny this.|$|E
50|$|For {{larger scale}} asphalt {{recycling}}, several in-place recycling techniques {{have been developed}} to rejuvenate oxidized binders and remove cracking, although the recycled material is generally not very water-tight or smooth and should be overlaid with a new layer of asphalt concrete. Cold in-place recycling mills off the top layers of asphalt concrete and mixes the resulting loose <b>millings</b> with asphalt emulsion. The mixture is then placed back down on the roadway and compacted. The water in the emulsion is allowed to evaporate for a week or so, and new hot-mix asphalt is laid on top.|$|E
50|$|Full depth {{reclamation}} is {{a process}} which pulverizes the full thickness of the asphalt pavement {{and some of the}} underlying material to provide a uniform blend of material. A binding agent may be mixed in to form a base course for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a subbase course. Common binding agents include asphalt emulsion, fly ash, Portland cement or calcium chloride. It can also be mixed with aggregate, recycled asphalt <b>millings,</b> or crushed Portland cement to improve the gradation of the material, and can provide a design life cycle of 30 years with proper lab testing and field verification.|$|E
