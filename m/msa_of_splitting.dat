40|$|Recently, we have {{identified}} the mannose-specific adhesin encoding gene (<b>msa)</b> <b>of</b> Lactobacillus plantarum. In the current study, structure and function of this potentially probiotic effector gene were further investigated, exploring genetic diversity <b>of</b> <b>msa</b> in L. plantarum in relation to mannose adhesion capacity. The results demonstrate that there is considerable variation in quantitative in vitro mannose adhesion capacity, which is paralleled by msa gene sequence variation. The <b>msa</b> genes <b>of</b> different L. plantarum strains encode proteins with variable domain composition. Construction of L. plantarum 299 v mutant strains revealed that the msa gene product is the key-protein for mannose adhesion, also in a strain with high mannose adhering capacity. However, no straightforward correlation between adhesion capacity and domain composition <b>of</b> <b>Msa</b> in L. plantarum could be identified. Nevertheless, differences in Msa sequences in combination with variable genetic background of specific bacterial strains appears to determine mannose adhesion capacity and potentially affects probiotic properties. These findings exemplify the strain-specificity of probiotic characteristics and illustrate the need for careful and molecular selection of new candidate probiotic...|$|R
