30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} renewable energy resources, wind power has drawn much attention in recent years. The stochastic characteristics of wind speed lead to generation output uncertainties of wind energy conversion system (WECS) and affect power system reliability, especially at high wind power penetration levels. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis toward WECS as well as an appropriate reliability assessment model are essential for maintaining the reliable operation of power systems. In this paper, the impact of wind turbine outage probability on system reliability is firstly developed by considering the following factors: running time, operating environment, operating conditions, and wind speed fluctuations. A multi-state model for wind farms is also established. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed model can be well applied to power system reliability assessment as well as solving a series of reliability-centered decision-making problems of power system scheduling and <b>maintenance</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|E

40|$|Rural {{electrification}} {{has been}} a priority for many governmental and international donor organisations. Grid extension and various renewable energy technology (RET) options are recognised as viable means of providing enhanced energy and water services to isolated rural communities, and these have been successfully deployed in many regions across the world. In Nigeria, decentralized energy generation systems based on solar PV systems are often used to meet the low energy demands of rural areas and they have also been widely adopted for water pumping purposes in these places. However, the failure or underperformance {{of many of these}} installations is in stark contrast to their theoretical viabilities as asserted in many academic papers; this suggests deep underlying problems. Such failures have discouraged government and policy makers from supporting solar PV and, as an extension, other forms of RE projects as viable options for isolated rural locations, even when grid extensions to these places often remain economically and practically challenging. Hence, whereas a number solar PV projects have been implemented in rural communities in the country, appraisal of their success and failures has moved at a much slower pace. Evidence is needed, not only about the factors that contribute to the deployment of these RE installations, but also on issues that took place after such installations have been completed: if the technology fulfils people’s needs and priorities, if the equipment remained in working order and for how long, and the particular and general decisions and actions that {{may have contributed to the}} success or failure of the installations. The aim of this study is therefore two-fold. Firstly, to reveal and understand the fundamental issues and factors that mitigate against the proper deployment, diffusion and performance of solar PV installations in isolated rural locations in Nigeria and, secondly, to develop a framework and set of recommendations that could lead to improved deployment processes and better performance of such installations. In order to understand and address these fundamental issues, a systematic analysis of relevant literatures on renewable energy technologies and technology diffusion is initially undertaken. In addition, multiple methods including site visits, observation and physical evaluation of installations, interviews and discussions with stakeholders and key players, and seven exploratory studies of rural communities are utilised to collect primary data on the performance and effectiveness of solar PV installations. Thirty-Eight indicators across five core sustainability dimensions of Technical, Economical/Financial, Environmental Impact, Social-Ethical Development, and Institutional Development and Government Policies are used to assess and evaluate the study cases, revealing diverse and interconnected pre- and post-installation factors that contribute to both successful and failed installations. A main finding of the study is that involvement of private energy providers in the deployment and running of solar PV installations in rural communities in the country is more effective than the sole use of government agencies or contractors. It was also revealed that a number of factors including weak or absence of post-installation <b>maintenance</b> <b>arrangements,</b> non-existence of local representative authorities, failure to enlighten local residents on limitations of the installation and to train them on basic maintenance practices, weak implementation and low success of government policies, weak institutions and overlapping functions of government agencies impacted negatively on the performance of the installations. In addition, the study provides insights into the interrelationships between the factors; how the presence or absence of some can strengthen or weaken others. Finally, a framework and set of recommendations are generated that could support improved deployment procedures and enhanced performance of solar PV installations in rural communities. Although the study deals with the Nigerian situation, some of the findings can be readily extended to other developing countries with similar challenges in the provision of energy and water services to isolated rural communities.

40|$|Deltas are dynamic landforms at the {{boundary}} of land and sea, involving intricate mazes of rivers and small waterways, wetlands, estuaries and coastal barrier islands. They are home to over half a billion people. Deltas are also home to rich ecosystems, such as mangroves and marshes. They are economic hotspots, supporting much of the world’s fisheries, forest products, and extensive agriculture. Yet, delta systems are under threat from sea-level rise, cyclones, river flooding, storm surges, rapid urbanization, agricultural over-use and pollution, salinization, sediment starvation, coastal erosion, and natural and man-made subsidence. One of the missions of the Delta Alliance is to support the development and proliferation of new approaches in delta management through research, exchange of best practices and outreach of concepts and ideas. This report {{provides an overview of}} new approaches emerging in several deltas that can be labelled under the heading of Adaptive Delta Management. Adaptive management can be defined as a structured, iterative process of robust decision making in the face of uncertainty, with an aim to reduce uncertainty over time via system monitoring. Applying adaptive management to deltas is relatively new {{and one of the first}} explicit uses is by the Dutch Delta Program. The Dutch Delta Program formulates Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) as phased decision-making that takes uncertain long-term developments into account explicitly and in with transparency towards society. Adaptive delta management encourages an integrated and flexible approach to land and water management with to aim to reduce vulnerability limit the risk of over- or underinvestment in future challenges such as flood risk management and freshwater supplies. This report shows that ADM is developing rapidly into a fascinating new type of decision making under an uncertain future. The reasons for using the new approach are convincing, the theoretical foundation is growing and the results on the ground are promising. Adaptive Delta Management can be captured as a cyclic process of which the overall design does not differ much from traditional planning steps. However, the approach and methods within each step contain new elements, such as long term scenario building, adaptation pathway developments, signposts and triggers. In this report we distinguish the following building blocks for ADM: Connecting short term investments with long term challenges As part of ADM a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions and establish a framework to guide future actions. Typical in ADM is that such a vision has a longer time horizon than usual in planning activities (e. g. a century), in order to capture the long term processes of climate change. So instead of focusing on short-term ‘trial and error’ actions and projects, the idea is to keep the long term vision in mind while prioritizing short-term ‘no regret’ actions. Scenario development is an important tool in this process, against which strategies can be tested to see how robust these strategies are. Path dependency and adaptation pathways The history of deltas shows developments which, once started, cannot easily be changed or adapted to new conditions. This is what we call path dependency: the extent to which a policy action is limited by actions implemented in the past or by actions planned anterior in the pathway. Learning from the past and knowing that we cannot predict the future this leads us to the ambition to avoid Towards a comprehensive framework for adaptive delta management June 2014 Delta Alliance 3 such lock-ins. One way to do this is to use adaptation pathways: i. e. a sequence of policy actions over time that is able to achieve a set of objectives. Avoidance of over- and under investments Insight in the adaptation pathways is not only relevant for the required flexibility of measures, but also in view of the risks of over- or under-investments. Underinvestment occurs if it turns out that the solutions are not adequate. Overinvestment on the other hand happens when measures are over dimensioned, which proved unnecessary and therefore too expensive. Connecting public and private (investment) agendas Another building block for ADM is to actively search for windows of opportunity to combine different investment agendas, either within the public domain or between public and private investments. This way measures may be easier (and cheaper) to implement and yield more added (societal) value. The way forward Three phases can be defined in applying ADM. The first phase focuses on identification of current and future problems and challenges based on relevant future scenarios. In the second phase options are explored which might enhance the sustainability and/or reduce the vulnerability for both current threats and longer term uncertain futures. The last phase focuses on integrating the adaptation options into viable management strategies and ensuring their proper implementation. Until now the first two steps are gaining momentum, although more knowledge is needed on how deltas as complex dynamic systems work. How to link the second and the third step, where financing arrangements, public (infrastructure) procurement strategies, implementation constraints and opportunities as well as durable <b>maintenance</b> <b>arrangements</b> play a decisive role, is yet to be explored. We can potentially learn much by analyses of best practices which take into account the diversity in social and cultural dimensions. These practical experiences can thus generate a larger body of knowledge on delta planning and management...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{order to}} improve people’s health worldwide, many efforts {{have been made in}} order to meet Millennium Development Goal 7 c: {{reducing}} by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Kenya is in the top ten of countries with the largest population without access to safe drinking water (UNICEF and WHO, 2012). Because most of these people live in rural areas, large investments are done in the Kenyan rural water supply. But recent studies show that many of the new water supplies stop functioning within a few years after implementation (MWI, 2007 and RWSN, 2007). Causes for this low ‘post-construction sustainability’ can be technical, institutional, financial, social or environmental. One of the most critical factors which is mentioned in literature is an adequate financing of operation and maintenance. This Master Thesis is about the post-construction sustainability of rural water supplies in Western Kenya, with a specific focus on the financial part of it (or financial sustainability). In the rural water supply practice in Western Kenya, several water supply technologies exist. Some of these technologies require hardly any operation and maintenance (O&M), like springs, surface water catchment, rain water catchment and a well without a pump. These technologies are not included in the current research. Remaining technologies are a handpump and a motorized pump, both used for groundwater pumping. Apart from the differences in technologies, several management models for rural water supply exist within Western Kenya: community management, government management, private management and institutional management. The latter one is not included in the current research because at these locations serving the community is in general not the main purpose. As the access to clean and safe water in adequate quantities is recognised as a human rights issue in Kenya (Constitution of Kenya, 2010), mechanisms for finding sustainable service delivery is a key national priority. As different management models are likely to result into different levels of sustainability, government of Kenya is in search of a most sustainable model for Kenyan context. Objective The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the financial sustainability of rural water supplies in Western Kenya. Within this comparison the aim is to compare different technology types, different management models and different combinations of these two. The final goal is that this comparison can be used by the Government of Kenya and other supporting entities in the development of policies and projects for the rural water supplies. Methodology Data for this study is collected during interviews with the responsible persons for the water supplies. Data is collected about service level, O&M, financial management, cost recovery and finances. Service level includes system functioning, water quantity, walking distances and water quality. O&M includes who is responsible for the daily operation and pump check and for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the days it takes between a breakdown and a repair. Financial management includes: responsibility for the finances, water tariff, tariff structure, bank account, bookkeeping and service cut-off for non- payment. Cost recovery includes the practice of the payments, the extent in which the income covers the O&M costs and whether replacement is expected to be a problem on the long term. The finances include the yearly income, costs and costs per user. To all above mentioned factors scores are assigned depending on the output per criteria. The scores are also given a weighing factor. In this way, for every water supply a weighted score can be determined for all the four sustainability categories. In total 27 handpumps and 25 motorized pumps were evaluated. Conclusions and recommendations Out of all handpumps, the locations with community management and the locations with combined community and government management scored low. The communities were not able to collect enough money to keep the system functioning on the long term. The private managed handpumps scored good, especially in terms of cost recovery and quick response to breakdowns. The motorized pumps scored low at the locations with combined community and government management and at the locations with government management. At the combined managed motorized pumps the responsibilities for O&M and financial management were not clear. At the government managed motorized pumps the payments were not good enough to cover the costs. At the community managed motorized pumps, the committees were well organized but they did not manage to make all users pay. At the privately managed motorized pumps, the responsibilities for O&M and financial management were not clearly defined but the financial situation was good. There was enough money for the O&M and for replacement on the long term. Comparing the two technologies, the handpumps score higher on cost recovery and the motorized pumps score higher on O&M and financial management. At the handpumps it happens more often that the regular money collection is neglected. The responsible entities at the motorized pumps have more need to be organized because of the daily need for staff and money for e. g. fuel refilling. A negative side of the motorized pumps are the high costs per user per year, about nine times higher than at the handpumps. Comparing the four management models, the differences were not big. The community managed locations have difficulties with making people pay. At the combined managed systems the responsibilities for O&M and financial management are not clear. At the government systems the costs (including high salaries of government staff) are too high for the amount of users. The privately managed systems score slightly higher, especially in terms of cost recovery. Because of the fact that the water quantity is not sufficient at many locations and the walking distances are large, more water supplies are needed in the research area. It is recommended to focus more on handpumps than on motorized pumps for new water supplies. The reason for that are the high yearly costs at the motorized pumps. These costs make the motorized pumps less suitable for the rural areas of Western Kenya, where domestic income is low and people are not open to pay for their water. In some situations, with low water tables or high population density, a handpump is not feasible and than a motorized pump can be a good option for rural water supply. It is also recommended that action is taken in {{order to improve}} users’ willingness to pay. Four recommendations are: - Activities for economic development like job creation and microfinance projects. When people get to spend more, they become more open to pay for water. - Training in communities about the importance of clean water, which is not free. This includes basic insight in costs of water supply technologies. - Training for responsible entities about dealing with sanctions against non-payment and about making finances more transparent. In order to improve community management it is recommended that costs and responsibilities are shared within communities, local authorities and the central government. In the current situation, especially the tasks of the local authorities are not fully recognized: financing a part of major repairs of water supplies, monitoring the performance of individual facilities, conflict and problem resolution and retraining of mechanics and communities. For their monitoring task, the current study and other studies are used to constitute a basic half yearly performance monitoring. Since the private management model scores high on financial sustainability, it is recommended that the Government of Kenya and development partners pay more attention to this option. In order to create a situation where private management is a serious option, several aspects need to be considered: - The government need to contribute in investment costs. For e. g. the handpumps, they can contribute in the same way as in the current programmes with the community managed handpumps where the government pays 65 % of the investment costs. - Community sensitization is required about the option of a private handpump. People need to know about this option. And they need insight in the costs and possible revenue. - Training is required for private owners of a water supply about water supply technologies, maintenance and dealing with financial management. - Formal recognition and regulation of such private investors is necessary as they will be running water systems as businesses.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the competition and}} welfare effects of vertical price fixing through industry-wide resale price <b>maintenance</b> (RPM) <b>arrangements,</b> such as those benefiting from exemption from a general prohibition against RPM. A bilateral oligopoly framework is employed incorporating differentiation between manufacturer products and between retailer services. Transactions between the stages involve prices being determined through bargaining. We do not find RPM to be universally undesirable. However where retailer power is strong, the social effects of RPM {{are likely to be}} adverse, since the practice can assist in coordinating final price levels and prevent socially desirable countervailing power arising. ...|$|R
40|$|This movie {{illustrates}} exact {{construction and}} <b>maintenance</b> of <b>arrangements</b> induced by arcs of great circles embedded on the sphere, {{also known as}} geodesic arcs, and exact computation of Voronoi diagrams on the sphere, the bisectors of which are geodesic arcs. This class of Voronoi diagrams includes the subclass of Voronoi diagrams of points and its generalization, power diagrams, also known as Laguerre Voronoi diagrams. The resulting diagrams are represented as arrangements, and can be passed as input to consecutive operations supported by the Arrangement_ 2 package of Cgal and its derivatives. The implementation handles well degenerate input and produces exact results...|$|R
