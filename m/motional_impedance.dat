Several variations of a fully silicon-based bulk micromachining fabrication process referred to as HARPSS have been developed, characterized and optimized to overcome most of the challenges facing application of such devices as manufacturable electronic components.

40|$|Abstract — Electrostatically {{actuated}} {{microelectromechanical system}} (MEMS) oscillators {{are limited to}} few megahertz– gigahertz range on account of transduction inefficiency at higher frequencies. Piezoelectric transduction affords lower <b>motional</b> <b>impedances</b> at high frequencies, however mass-loading on account of metal electrodes imposes practical limits on the mechanical quality factor of piezoelectric resonators in the gigahertz frequency regime. In this paper, we present a silicon optoacoustic oscillator operating at 2. 05 GHz with signal power 18 dBm and phase noise − 80 dBc/Hz at 10 -kHz offset from carrier. We employ displacement amplification and partial air gap capacitive transduction to enhance the transduction efficiency. An unconventional photolithography step is performed on a released MEMS structure, which greatly simplifies the fabrication process and allows electrical contact with the electrodes. Built-in nonlinear optomechanical modulation provides noiseless up-conversion of the oscillation signal {{all the way up}} to 16. 4 GHz with − 45 -dBm signal power. We develop a phase noise model for the oscillator and identify the photodetector shot noise to be the dominant noise source. Using a high gain and low noise avalanche photodetector enables reduction of the far-from-carrier phase noise floor by 15 dB. The phase noise model provides insights into understanding the influence of laser detuning on the oscillator noise performance, which has not been studied to date.

Lamb-wave resonators {{are still in}} the perfectioning state and therefore there is a great demand for further understanding of various issues such as reducing the anchor-loss, spurious mode suppression using various designs and simulation techniques such as finite-element methods. AlN, ZnO and recently PZT thin-films are the prevalent piezoelectric materials utilized in the resonators. Of these, PZT has the highest electromechanical coupling-factor which is a big opportunity {{to reduce the size of}} the filters and keep the <b>motional</b> <b>impedance</b> low. PZT suffers from a high feed-through due to its high dielectric permittivity which, as a consequence, drastically reduces the stopband rejection. In this thesis, to overcome this problem, we propose a feed-through cancellation method in the presence of specific grounding resistances (non-zero grounding) at the input- and output-sides, which always exist and prevent perfect grounding. Particularly, these grounding resistances have been considered in the designs. Using the proposed technique, the stopband rejection of the resonator is improved by more than 20 dB. Two different bandpass filter configurations (i. e. mechanically coupled and differentially readout) are presented in this thesis. The mechanically-coupled filter consists of two mechanically-coupled resonators with identical designed wave-length. One resonator is used to actuate the whole coupled structure and the other one is used to pick up the signal. The mechanically-coupled filter is actuated using two differential input signals and on the other side, the output signal is also picked up using a differential readout. As both actuation and readout are done using a differential technique, the feed-through signals trough air and substrate are not eliminated. Therefore, the filter shows a low stopband rejection. To overcome this problem, a new concept of bandpass filter is proposed in this thesis called, differential readout filter. Two different filters at two different resonance frequencies around 380 MHz and 700 MHz are presented. This technique showed a considerable improvement in the performance of RF-MEMS filters compared to the existing Lamb wave filters. Conventional electromechanical filters are using mechanical and/or electrical couplings, however, this new technique is based on the phase change of two un-coupled resonators below and above their resonances.

In addition, the material exhibits low acoustic loss, and low optical loss in the infrared range. In this work, I investigated the possibility of combining these properties with the highly versatile micro-fabricated structures on a layer transferred LiNbO 3 thin film platform to achieve novel devices or improve the performance of existing device technologies. First, I focused on components for multi-frequency RF front-end applications. Specifically, I demonstrated LiNbO 3 thin-film contour mode resonators (CMRs) for multi-frequency wide bandwidth RF filters. The resonators exhibit mechanical Q ranging from 1, 000 to over 3, 000, and kt 2 ranging from 4 % to 15 %. The highest kt 2 xQ demonstrated is 194. Along with the high Q and high kt 2, comes with the low <b>motional</b> <b>impedance,</b> which is important for achieve low filter insertion loss. In addition, the resonator frequencies are defined by photolithography, thus enabling devices with different frequencies to be integrated on a single chip. On a single chip, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 400 MHz to 2 GHz. As the achievable bandwidth of the filter is ultimately limited by the electro-mechanical coupling factor (kt 2) of the resonators, while the roll-off is determined by resonator quality factor (Q). Therefore, LiNbO 3 thin-film CMR technology shows great potential in achieving filters with wide bandwidth, steep roll-off and low insertion loss. In the meantime, I also investigated low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) LiTaO 3 thin-film resonators for oscilla- tor applications, another key component for multi-frequency RF front-ends. As LiTaO 3 also exhibits low acoustic loss and strong piezoelectric effect, LiTaO 3 CMRs also have high mechanical Q and kt 2, which is important to achieve low oscillator phase noise, jitter and good power handling capability. With the capability of multi-frequency integration, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 500 MHz to 900 MHz and a TCF as low as 16 ppm/K and Q as high as 3200. In addition, these devices exhibit low <b>motional</b> <b>impedance</b> (10 - 20), which {{is important for the}} power handling for oscillator application. While commercial markets demand multi-frequency band-select duplexer and diplexer filters, with fractional bandwidth (BW) ranging from 3 % to 10 %, steep filter roll-off and low insertion loss; components for reconfigurable RF front-ends are actively pursued for defense applications. In this work, frequency programmable RF MEMS resonators for reconfigurable RF front-ends is investigate. Exploiting tip based piezoelectric domain engineering in LiNbO 3 thin film, the mechanical resonance coupled by the electrode transducers can be programmed. Therefore, resonator frequency can be "written" and "erased". Particularly, a 681 MHz resonance peak is "written" on the programmable resonator and "erased". Finally, LiNbO 3 thin-film disk resonators are demonstrated exhibiting intrinsic optical quality factor of 484 k, which is highest demonstrated from thin-film LiNbO 3 resonators to date. Taking advantage of the high quality factor, acousto-optic modulation is demonstrated. As a demonstration of concept, electrical field is applied to the photonic disk resonator through a metal probe, and causes modulation of the optical carrier. A 35 dBm beat note between the optical carrier and the modulated side band was generated from the photodetector. The thin-film LN platform can open up paths to many novel and high performance devices. Presented here are building blocks for RF and photonic applications. Combin- ing mechanical resonators with optical ones, acousto-optic modulator is also demonstrated. In parallel, leveraging piezoelectric domain engineering, reconfigurable RF front-end can also be achieved. Moving forward, other novel devices (chip-scale optical frequency combs, high efficiency chip scale optical frequency doubling and THz generation) can be achieved leveraging other multi-domain coupling properties of LiNbO 3 with the building blocks demonstrated here. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Microelectromechanical {{resonators}} are advantageous over traditional LC {{tanks in}} transceiver circuits {{due to their}} high quality factors (Q > 10000), small size and low power consumption. These characteristics enable monolithic integration of MEMS-based resonators as high-performance filters and oscillators at GHz frequencies in wireless communication technology. Similarly, they are desirable as high-precision low phase-noise clocking sources in microprocessor technology. To this end, both dielectric and piezoelectric transduction based resonators have been demonstrated as viable alternatives to their electrical counterparts. Dielectric (or electrostatic) based resonators {{take advantage of the}} cost-scaling of Silicon micromachining and the excellent mechanical properties of single crystal Silicon, leading to high- Q low cost resonators that have been extensively explored over the past two decades. However, piezoelectric based resonators have generally been preferred over these due to their high electromechanical coupling coefficients (kT 2 ~ 4 %) resulting in a much lower insertion loss, larger power handling defined by the breakdown voltage across piezoelectric films and ease of packing and integration into transceiver circuitry. Transistor sensing has been employed in both electrostatic and piezoelectric devices to enhance sensing efficiency. In particular, the Resonant Body Transistor (RBT) has been demonstrated as an electrostatic device which utilizes internal dielectric transduction to achieve the highest frequency acoustic resonators to date. The FET based sensing also pushes the operating frequency higher fundamentally as it is now limited only by the transistor cutoff frequency. In this work, we investigate the RBT geometry with piezoelectric transduction for more efficient and low loss drive and sense. To this end a full analytical model of the Piezoelectric RBT is presented explaining the piezoelectric drive and piezoelectricpiezoresistive mechanism-based sensing. The equivalent circuit model is presented and optimized for linearity in the AC output current to minimize harmonic distortion and for lowering the <b>motional</b> <b>impedance.</b> It is finally compared to a traditional piezoelectric resonator while discussing the tradeoffs with respect to the desired applications. by Radhika Marathe.

40|$|With quality factors (Q) often {{exceeding}} 10, 000, vibrating micromechanical resonators {{have emerged}} as leading candidates for on-chip versions of high-Q resonators used in wireless communications systems, sensor networks, and clocking sources in microprocessors. However, extending the frequency of MEMS resonators generally entails scaling of resonator dimensions leading to increased <b>motional</b> <b>impedance.</b> In this dissertation, I introduce a new transduction mechanism using dielectric materials to improve performance and increase frequency of silicon-based RF acoustic resonators. Traditionally, electrostatically transduced mechanical resonators have used air-gap capacitors for driving and sensing vibrations in the structure. To increase transduction efficiency, facilitate fabrication, and enable GHz frequencies of operation, it is desirable to replace air-gap transducers with dielectric films. In my doctoral work, I designed, fabricated, and demonstrated dielectrically transduced silicon bulk-mode resonators up to 6. 2 GHz, marking the highest acoustic frequency measured in silicon to date. The concept of internal dielectric transduction is introduced, in which dielectric transducers are incorporated directly into the resonator body. With dielectric films positioned at points of maximum strain in the resonator, this transduction improves in efficiency with increasing frequency, enabling resonator scaling to previously unattainable frequencies. Using internal dielectric transduction, longitudinal-mode resonators exhibited the highest frequency-quality factor (f. Q) product in silicon to date at 5. 1 x 10 exp(13) s exp(- 1). These resonators were measured by capacitively driving and sensing acoustic vibrations in the device. However, capacitive detection often requires 3 -port scalar mixer measurement, complicating monolithic integration of the resonators with CMOS circuits. The internal dielectric bulk-mode resonators can be utilized in a 2 -port configuration with capacitive drive and piezoresistive detection, in which carrier mobility is dynamically modulated by elastic waves in the resonator. Piezoresistive sensing of silicon-based dielectrically transduced resonators was demonstrated with 1. 6 % frequency tuning and control of piezoresistive transconductance gm by varying the current flowing through the device. Resonant frequency, determined by lithographically defined dimensions, was demonstrated over a wide frequency range. These degrees of freedom enable acoustic resonators spanning a large range of frequencies on a single chip, despite design restrictions of the CMOS process. As we scale to deep sub-micron (DSM) technology, transistor cut-off frequencies increase, enabling the design of CMOS circuits for RF and mm-wave applications greater than 60 GHz. However, DSM transistors have limited gain and integrated passives demonstrate low Q, resulting in poor efficiency. A successful transition into DSM CMOS requires enhanced-gain and high-Q components operating at microwave frequencies. In this work, a merged NEMS-CMOS device is introduced that can function as a building block to enhance the performance of RF circuits. The device, termed the Resonant Body Transistor (RBT), consists of a field effect transistor embedded {{in the body of}} a high-frequency NEMS resonator implementing internal dielectric transduction. The results of this work indicate improved resonator performance with increased frequency, providing a means of scaling MEMS resonators to previously unattainable frequencies in silicon. With the transduction methods developed in this work, a hybrid NEMSCMOS RBT enables low-power, narrow-bandwidth low noise amplifier design for transceivers and low phase-noise oscillator arrays for clock generation and temperature sensing in microprocessors...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} {{development of}} wireless and mobile communication systems has lead to rapid technology innovation in component performance, {{complementary metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) compatible fabrication techniques, and system improvement to satisfy requirements for faster signal processing, cost efficiency, chip miniaturization, and low power consumption. The demands for the high-performance communication systems whose fundamentals are precise timing and frequency control have driven the current research interests to develop advanced reference oscillators and radio frequency (RF) bandpass filters. In turn a promising microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonator technology is required to achieve the ultimate goal. That is, micromechanical vibrating resonators with high quality factor (Q) and good frequency-temperature stability at high series resonance frequency (fs) are the required fundamental components for a high-performance wireless communication system. Recently, Lamb wave mode propagating in piezoelectric thin plates has attracted great attention for designs of the electroacoustic resonators since it combines the advantages of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) : high phase velocity and multiple frequency excitation by an interdigital transducer (IDT). More specifically, the Lamb wave resonator (LWR) based on an aluminum nitride (AlN) thin film has attracted many attentions because it can offer the high resonance frequency, small temperature-induced frequency drift, low motional resistance, and CMOS compatibility. The lowest-order symmetric (S 0) Lamb wave mode propagation in the AlN thin plate is particularly preferred because it exhibits a phase velocity close to 10, 000 m/s, a low dispersive phase velocity characteristic, and a moderate electromechanical coupling coefficient. However, the uncompensated AlN LWR shows a first-order temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of approximately - 25 ppm/C. This level of the temperature stability is unsuitable for any timing application. In addition, the Q of the AlN LWR is degraded to several hundred while the IDT finger width is downscaled to a nanometer scale to raise the resonance frequency up to a few GHz. This dissertation presents comprehensive analytical and experimental results on {{a new class of}} temperature-compensated and high-Q piezoelectric AlN LWRs. The temperature compensation of the AlN LWR using the S 0 Lamb wave mode is achieved by adding a layer of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) with an appropriate thickness ratio to the AlN thin film, and the AlN/SiO 2 LWRs can achieve a low first-order TCF at room temperature. Based on the multilayer plate composed of a 1 -um-thick AlN film and a 0. 83 -um-thick SiO 2 layer, a temperature-compensated LWR operating at a series resonance frequency of 711 MHz exhibits a zero first-order TCF and a small second-order TCF of - 21. 5 ppb/C^ 2 at its turnover temperature, 18. 05 C. The temperature dependence of fractional frequency variation is less than 250 parts per million (ppm) over a wide temperature range from - 55 to 125 C. In addition to the temperature compensation at room temperature, the thermal compensation of the AlN LWRs is experimentally demonstrated at high temperatures. By varying the normalized AlN and SiO 2 thicknesses to the wavelength, the turnover temperature can be designed at high temperatures and the AlN LWRs are temperature-compensated at 214, 430, and 542 C, respectively. The temperature-compensated AlN/SiO 2 LWRs are promising for a lot of applications including thermally stable oscillators, bandpass filters, and sensors at room temperature as well as high temperatures. The influences of the bottom electrode upon the characteristics of the LWRs utilizing the S 0 Lamb wave mode in the AlN thin plate are theoretically and experimentally studied. Employment of a floating bottom electrode for the LWR reduces the static capacitance in the AlN membrane and accordingly enhances the effective coupling coefficient. The floating bottom electrode simultaneously offers a large coupling coefficient and a simple fabrication process than the grounded bottom electrode but the transduction efficiency is not sacrificed. In contrast to those with the bottom electrode, an AlN LWR with no bottom electrode shows a high Q of around 3, 000 since it gets rid of the electrical loss in the metal-to-resonator interface. In addition, it exhibits better power handling capacity than those with the bottom electrode since less thermal nonlinearity induced by the self-heating exists in the resonators. In order to boost the Q, a new class of the AlN LWRs using suspended convex edges is introduced in this dissertation for the first time. The suspended convex edges can efficiently reflect the Lamb waves back towards the transducer as well as confine the mechanical energy in the resonant body. Accordingly the mechanical energy dissipation through the support tethers is significantly minimized and the Q can be markedly enhanced. More specifically, the measured frequency response of a 491. 8 -MHz LWR with suspended biconvex edges yields a Q of 3, 280 which represents a 2. 6 x enhancement in Q over a 517. 9 -MHz LWR based on the same AlN thin plate but with the suspended flat edges. The suspended convex edges can efficiently confine mechanical energy in the LWR and reduce the energy dissipation through the support tethers without increasing the <b>motional</b> <b>impedance</b> of the resonator. In addition, the radius of curvature of the suspended convex edges and the AlN thickness normalized to the wavelength can be further optimized to simultaneously obtain high Q, low <b>motional</b> <b>impedance,</b> and large effective coupling coefficient. To further enhance the Q of the LWR, a composite plate including an AlN thin film and an epitaxial cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC) layer is introduced to enable high-Q and high-frequency micromechanical resonators utilizing high-order Lamb wave modes. The use of the epitaxial 3 C-SiC layer is attractive as SiC crystals have been theoretically proven to have an exceptionally large fs and Q product due to its low acoustic loss characteristic at microwave frequencies. In addition, AlN and 3 C-SiC have well-matched mechanical and electrical properties, making them a suitable material stack for the electroacoustic resonators. The epitaxial 3 C-SiC layer not only provides the micromechanical resonators with a low acoustic loss layer to boost their Q but also enhances the electromechanical coupling coefficients of some high-order Lamb waves in the AlN/ 3 C-SiC composite plate. A micromachined electroacoustic resonator utilizing the third quasi-symmetric (QS 3) Lamb wave mode in the AlN/ 3 C-SiC composite plate exhibits a Q of 5, 510 at 2. 92 GHz, resulting in the highest fs and Q product, 1. 61 x 10 ^ 13 Hz, among suspended piezoelectric thin film resonators to date...|$|E
40|$|On-chip {{vibrating}} MEMS resonators {{with high}} frequency-Q product {{on par with}} that of the off-chip quartz crystals have attracted lots of attention from both academia and industry for applications on sensing, signal processing, and wireless communication. Up to now, several approaches for monolithic integration of MEMS and transistors have been demonstrated. Vibrating micromechanical disk resonators which utilize electroplated nickel as the structural material along with either a solid-gap high-k dielectric capacitive transducer or a piezoelectric transducer have great potential to offer unprecedented performance and capability of seamless integration with integrated circuits. Despite the frequency drift problems encountered in early attempts to use nickel as a structural material in MEMS gyroscopes, this low temperature nickel electroplating technology is amenable to post-transistor planar integration. The nickel microstructure is formed through the photoresist molding and electroplating process which enables the microstructure to have extremely high aspect ratio while retaining the overall process temperature under 60 ºC. This temperature is low enough to allow the RF MEMS devices to be fabricated directly on top of foundry IC chips, thus enabling post-transistor monolithic integration with minimum parasitics. In addition, the electroplating setup for nickel deposition can be much cheaper as compared to the other deposition facilities (e. g., PVD, CVD, etc). However, as the dimensions of the resonators are shrunk to µm range, several issues have come forth such as higher motional resistance and lower power handling ability. In order to reduce the motional resistance, high permittivity material is employed to form a solid capacitive gap instead of an air gap. As compared to the air gap, ease of the process, better stability and elimination of the particles are the additional benefits of using the solid gap. Therefore, an ultra-thin high-k dielectric layer with atomically controlled thickness down to sub-nm range can be deposited under 100 ºC on the vertical sidewall of the device structure by using ALD processing technology. This enhances the efficiency of the capacitive transducer enormously, thus reducing the characteristic motional resistance of the device. This research project explored the idea of applying low temperature process of electroplated nickel and high-k solid-gap as well as partially-filled air-gap capacitive transducers. To further reduce the <b>motional</b> <b>impedance,</b> electromechanically-coupled resonator arrays have been implemented. Furthermore, the linearity of solid-gap versus partially-filled air-gap resonators has been studied through a modeling approach for RF applications. In the meanwhile, this work also investigated electroplated nickel as a structural material for piezoelectrically-transduced resonators to demonstrate piezoelectric-on-nickel resonators with low temperature process. The thin film piezoelectric resonators can achieve high resonance frequency when increasing the piezoelectric film thickness and scaling down the device size. However, the sputtered piezoelectric films have very low deposition rate which limits the thickness to a couple of microns or less. Moreover, the yield of piezoelectric resonators is restricted after the releasing process since the stress of the thin films usually causes the structural layer to buckle or fracture. Thus, the development of piezoelectric-on-substrate resonators is an alternative solution to resolve the aforementioned issues. The previous work has been done by using single crystal silicon or nano-crystalline diamond (NCD) as resonator structural materials due to their high acoustic velocity and low loss. However, the deposition temperature for thin film silicon and diamond is too high to be allowable thermal budget of ICs. Therefore, electroplated nickel is also a reasonable substitute for silicon and diamond substrates while realizing high frequency and moderate Q. Furthermore, it is observed that a localized annealing process through Joule heating can be adopted to significantly improve the effective mechanical quality factor for the ZnO-on-nickel resonators. This work successfully demonstrated the ZnO-on-nickel piezoelectrically-actuated MEMS resonators and resonator arrays with frequencies ranging from a few megahertz to 1. 5 GHz by using IC compatible low temperature process...|$|E
