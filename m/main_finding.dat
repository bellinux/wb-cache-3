5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the <b>main</b> <b>finding.</b> In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} Arizona State University study were {{somewhat}} different from Pager’s study, but the <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was expected: Incarceration decreased {{the chances of}} getting employed. For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most amount of callbacks, roughly 40%. Hispanic women followed up with a 34% callback rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record {{were less likely to}} receive a callback compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and Hispanic women with a community college degree applying online.|$|E

The study asked two questions: How the student-centered teaching approach was defined by individual researchers; and what the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> were in those studies. Twenty eight studies were selected for the literature review. <b>Main</b> <b>findings</b> of the review indicated that the student-centered teaching approach took a variety of forms, or it was individually defined, and wide differences were also found in the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> of the studies...|$|R

25|$|Subsidies for {{the centers}} had reached NOK300 million by 1991. Two public {{evaluations}} with {{of the project}} concluded {{that it was a}} failure. The <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was that the decision to establish the centers had been taken early in the process and that reports and later work were then carried out to find areas to serve, instead of establishing if there was a market for the amount of centers. According to the report from Nordlandsforskning, only Norsk Data gained from the project. The overcapacity and costs tied up 92 percent of the public information technology budget, hindering other project which could have created value from being carried out. Lack of projects caused FUNN to not result in any advantages to the communities where it was located.|$|E

500|$|P.J. Webster {{and others}} {{published}} in 2005 {{an article in}} Science examining the [...] "changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity" [...] over the past 35 years, the period when satellite data has been available. Their <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was {{although the number of}} cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north Atlantic Ocean, there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.|$|E
500|$|In {{evidence}} of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements {{with the name of}} one author below each statement. They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them. Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was that there was a [...] "cognitive reorganization" [...] of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant's felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement.|$|E
500|$|Between 2008 and 2012, {{sociologist}} Sandy To, {{while at}} the University of Cambridge, conducted a 'grounded theory method' study in China regarding the topic. To's research focused on [...] "marriage partner choice" [...] by Chinese professional women {{in the form of}} a typology of four different [...] "partner choice strategies". The <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> of the study found that contrary to the popular belief that highly educated and single women remain unmarried, or do not want to take on traditional roles in marriage, because of personal preference, that in contrast, they commonly have an appetite for marriage and that their main obstacle is traditional patriarchal attitudes. The study also pointed out that in other Asian countries such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, where women have been receiving a higher education, that correspondingly, the average age of marriage amongst them is much higher. The Chinese People's Daily cited a 2012 United Nations survey that found 74 percent of women in the United Kingdom and 70 percent of women in Japan were single between the ages of 25 and 29. The China Daily published an article that cited figures from the 2012 United Nations' World Marriage Data which reported 38% of women in the United States, and more than 50% of women in Britain remained unmarried in their 30s.|$|E

2500|$|STI first {{submitted}} the article to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which rejected it in November 1999. Concerns cited by JAMA reviewers included that [...] "the <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> {{of the study}} is the high placebo response rate". They also suggested that the named authors confirm they had been [...] "granted full access to the data set to verify the accuracy of the report".|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of these findings}} has been criticized by Daniel Dennett, who argues that {{people will have to}} shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand. Consistent with this argument, subsequent {{studies have shown that the}} exact numerical value varies depending on attention. Despite the differences in the exact numerical value, however, the <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> has held. Philosopher Alfred Mele criticizes this design for other reasons. Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that [...] "the awareness of the intention to move" [...] is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their 'Bereitschaftspotential'.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a motion}} in {{parliament}} by Alfred Domett, the 4th Premier, three Australian commissioners were tasked with deciding where the capital should move to. The motion {{asked for the}} governors of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania to appoint one representative of each of those Australian states. The appointees were Joseph Docker, {{a member of the}} New South Wales Legislative Council, Francis Murphy, the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and Ronald Campbell Gunn, {{a former member of the}} Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Tasmanian Legislative Council. Sir George Grey appointed the commissioners to fulfil the brief [...] "that the Seat of Government should be placed in a central position, that is to say, somewhere upon the shores of Cook's Straits." [...] The commissioners inspected Wellington, Picton, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Tory Channel, Blenheim, Pelorus Sound, Havelock and Nelson. Their criteria were the central position in New Zealand that was asked for, access by water, land availability, resources in the surrounding country, defence considerations, and any natural disadvantages. The commissioners reported their findings in a simple two-page letter, where their <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was summed up in a single sentence without further elaboration: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{confidential}} UN report dated 26 April 2009 comparing UNOSAT {{images of}} the Safe Zone taken between 5 February 2009 and 19 April 2009 was leaked to the media. The images showed numerous craters caused by shelling. The <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> of the report was that [...] "there are new indications of building destruction and damages resulting from shelling and possible air-strikes". The report found that 60 main buildings had been destroyed to date in the Safe Zone but this excluded temporary structures erected by the IDPs as {{it was not possible}} to identify damage to these using satellite images. Over 5,000 IDP shelters had also been relocated during April 2009 due the shelling and bombardment. There was evidence of hundreds of craters and heavy damage to buildings outside the Safe Zone. The report concluded that damage estimates were a minimum and that the [...] "actual damages are likely to be greater". The accuracy of some of the damage suggested that it could only have been done by air-dropped bombs. Although the report does not apportion blame, given that Tamil Tigers' air wing had been destroyed in early 2009, this damage could only have been caused by the Sri Lankan Air Force. After being confronted with the UN satellite images during an interview with Al Jazeera Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona admitted that the Sri Lankan armed forces had carried out shelling and air raids in the Safe Zone. This contradicted the statements by the Sri Lankan government and President Rajapaksa, and an earlier statement by Kohona himself, that there was no shelling by the Sri Lankan armed forces in the Safe Zone.|$|E
