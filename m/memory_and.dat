5|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{individuals}} {{with a history of}} concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years.

5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks.

40|$|Science of {{literature}} uses different genres such as diaries, <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> letters as both literary genres and a resource of research.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{literature on}} the phenomenology of intrusive <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> intrusive images was reviewed systematically. The methodology adopted in the literature is described before presenting the phenomenological findings of intrusive <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> intrusive images across the following categories: 1) prevalence, 2) sensory qualities, 3) emotions and 4) characteristics. The {{similarities and differences between}} intrusive <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> intrusive images across clinical disorders are discussed. It is then considered whether intrusive <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> intrusive images represent separate phenomenon and a pragmatic model is briefly presented to conceptualise the distinctions that may exist. Finally, areas of further research are presented...|$|R

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
