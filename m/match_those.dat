5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features <b>match</b> <b>those</b> seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To <b>match</b> <b>those</b> observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E

5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that <b>match</b> <b>those</b> of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely <b>match</b> <b>those</b> of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of work, Fermi's group had {{tentatively}} determined that lighter elements would disperse {{the energy of the}} captured neutron by emitting a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray. This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim, but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not <b>match</b> <b>those</b> of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934. In it he proposed the name ausonium (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name Ausonia (Italy).|$|E
