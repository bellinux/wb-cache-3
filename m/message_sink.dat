40|$|The size of {{wireless}} sensor node {{is small and}} the battery power of these sensor nodes is also limited. The wireless sensor nodes consume battery power in transmitting, processing the data. Generally, Wireless sensor nodes consume more energy in transmitting the data than processing of the data. The wireless Sensor nodes are deployed in the far places like forests, it is vary difficult to recharge or replace the battery of these sensor nodes. Main focus {{of this research is}} to reduce the energy consumption of the wireless sensor nodes during data transmission. With the use of caching the energy consumption is reduced and data can be collected faster and traffic on the network will also reduce. The Inter discriminate nodes is responsible for storing of the data in its cache, when sink generates an query <b>message,</b> <b>sink</b> will directly access data from Inter-discriminate nodes. The source nodes collect the data and pass it to the Inter-discriminate node through the discriminate node. One possibility is that if the discriminate node is selfish and responsible of dropping of the data packets, then Inter-discriminate node will not able to get the collected data...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} how oncologists can balance explicit with general and realistic with hopeful information when discussing various topics at {{the transition from}} curative to palliative care in breast cancer. Methods: Qualitative analysis of focus groups consisting of female breast cancer survivors and healthy women. Results: Perceptions of survivors and healthy women largely overlapped. Participants thought that oncologists can help patients regain a future perspective during this consultation. To achieve this, four themes seemed important: honest medical information, availability of continued support, hope has many faces, and space to choose. Moreover, participants stressed they would need time to let the <b>message</b> <b>sink</b> in before any further information was provided. Conclusion: Participants thought that when confronted {{with this type of}} consultation they would need - more or less explicit - medical information and information regarding support. In order to maintain hope, knowledge about (treatment) possibilities is important, but also the certainty not to be abandoned by the hospital at a later stage of the disease and the confidence to remain able to make one's own decisions. Practice implications: A life-limiting diagnosis may shatter patients' future perspective; however, this study provides suggestions for oncologists to create a new perspective. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E

30|$|During every {{sampling}} period(round), if a node si {{does not}} send a <b>message</b> to <b>sink,</b> the sink node {{can use the}} value of residual energy of si which is transmitted latest and calculate {{the present value of}} residual energy of si according to the history of energy consumption pattern to calculate the average residual energy of all nodes or part of nodes. For example, the value of residual energy of a node si is 1.0 joule at the i th round. At the (i + 1)th round, the readings of the node si are very low, and so it does not send a <b>message</b> to the <b>sink</b> node. The sink node when it does not receive a message with the value of residual energy will think the node si is in sleeping mode at the (i + 1)th round. Assuming that the energy consumed in sleeping mode is 0.00001 joule, which is a constant generally, the sink node will compute the value of residual energy of the node si which is 0.99999 joule (1.0 - 0.00001) at the (i + 1)th round.|$|R

40|$|A {{communications}} network is a directed, acyclic graph with sources emitting <b>messages</b> and <b>sinks</b> having specific <b>message</b> demands. The messages {{are drawn from}} a specified alphabet and, for simplicity, the edges in the graph {{are assumed to be}} error-free, cost-free, and of zero-delay. Furthermore, only non-degenerate networks are considered, namely those with at least one directed path to each sink demanding a particular message from the supplying source. The problem is to determine a method of transmitting the messages through the network such that all sink demands are satisfied. Network Coding Traditionally, network messages are treated as physical commodities, which are simply transmitted throughout the network without alteration. However, the emerging field of network coding [1, 2] views the messages as information, which can be replicated and transformed by any node within the network. Network coding permits each outgoing edge from a node to carry some function of the data received on the incoming edges of the node. Thus, the goal is to determine a solution (a set of functions) that satisfies all sink demands. Network Coding Example The network in Figure 1 contains a single source emitting two <b>messages</b> and two <b>sinks</b> each demanding both messages. This network does not have a routing solution (due to the “bottleneck” edge e 4, 5). However, as depicted, a scalar linear solution using network coding exists. x x source x, y...|$|R

30|$|The network {{works in}} two phases: {{the first phase}} of node {{redistribution}} and the second phase of field monitoring and data gathering. During the second phase, each working sensor should send its sensing <b>message</b> to the <b>sink</b> node periodically.

With regard to the network survival lifetime, it can be calculated as the minimum survival time of its coronas.|$|R
30|$|When in {{our case}} nodes with {{different}} sinks want to exchange messages, the messages will firstly {{be sent to the}} sink of the sender via the different preferred parents.

Thereafter, this sink will send the message to the destination node.|$|R

It was while the submarine was in its allotted 'square' of the Atlantic in early May that he realised that the tide of battle had turned, when the boat intercepted a steady stream of distress <b>messages</b> from <b>sinking</b> colleagues. In a vain effort to counteract that tide, U-230 shadowed and prepared to attack a convoy, but was constantly harassed by aircraft; on one occasion the U-boat was fortunate to survive when both AA guns jammed (Werner had manned one of them).

3000|$|As {{shown in}} Procedure 4, si.CurEn means that si sends a sensed data message along with energy {{value to the}} sink in current {{sampling}} period (round). si.CalEn means that si does not send a <b>message</b> to the <b>sink,</b> and so uses the calculated value {{according to the latest}} history value to count. AvrChEn means the average residual energy of all cluster heads. Using the same method, we can get the average value of residual energy of all non-cluster head nodes AvrNonChEn in the WSNs. In sampling period (round), after the sink obtained the necessary information and completed the top-k computation, the sink would compare the residual energy value of every cluster head with the average residual energy of all non-cluster heads which is multiplied by a constant coefficient S _FACTOR. Sink may compare the average residual energy of all cluster heads with the average residual energy of all non-cluster heads which multiplied by a constant coefficient G _FACTOR. As shown in Procedure 5, S _FACTOR and G _FACTOR are constant coefficients; AvrNonChEn means the average residual energy of all non-cluster heads. If si sends a <b>message</b> to the <b>sink</b> at current sampling period, then si.En is si.CurEn, otherwise si.En is si. CalEn [...]. If AdjustFlag = True, sink will broadcast a message to all nodes in the WSNs to notify clustering, otherwise latest clustering results will be retained.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} prevent traffic {{analysis}} attacks by the global adversary, we propose an anti-traffic analysis (ATA) approach to protect the sink's location privacy by artificially homogenizing traffic intensity.
