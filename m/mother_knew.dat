25|$|The {{origin of}} the stage name Bo Diddley is unclear. McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name, which he {{suspected}} was an insult. He {{also said that the}} name first belonged to a singer his adoptive <b>mother</b> <b>knew.</b> Harmonicist Billy Boy Arnold said that it was a local comedian's name, which Leonard Chess adopted as McDaniel's stage name and the title of his first single. McDaniel also stated that it was his nickname as a Golden Gloves boxer.|$|E
25|$|Back in London in 1908, Mansfield quickly {{fell into}} a bohemian way of life. She {{published}} only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there. Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother, Garnet. By early 1909 she had become pregnant by Garnet, though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship and the two broke up. She hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a singing teacher 11 years older than she; they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening, before the marriage could be consummated. After a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield's mother, Annie Beauchamp, arrived in 1909. She blamed {{the breakdown of the}} marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter despatched to the spa town of Bad Wörishofen in Bavaria, Germany. Mansfield miscarried after attempting to lift a suitcase on top of a cupboard. It is not known whether her <b>mother</b> <b>knew</b> of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.|$|E
2500|$|The {{status of}} an {{abandoned}} child (Hebrew: asufi) {{was determined by the}} state in which it was found. If there were indications that the foundling had been abandoned due to the parents being unable to support it, then Halakhically the child would not be a mamzer. However, if the unknown parents could have supported the child, it was regarded as potentially being a mamzer. A child whose mother is known, but not the father, was known as [...] "silent one" [...] (Hebrew: shetukhi), and fell into the same category as a foundling; this status, however, could be changed if the <b>mother</b> <b>knew</b> and revealed the identity of the father.|$|E

2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} by police, Thomson said {{that she did not}} know the dead man.

However, she also {{reported}} that, at some time in late 1948, an unidentified man had attempted to visit her and asked a next door neighbour about her. In his book on the case, Gerry Feltus stated that when he interviewed Thomson (2002), he found that she was either being [...] "evasive" [...] or she [...] "just did not wish to talk about it".
