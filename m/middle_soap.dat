At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the <b>middle</b> <b>soap</b> phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E
25|$|Hard {{toilet soap}} with a {{pleasant}} smell {{was produced in}} the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854â€“925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the <b>Middle</b> East, <b>soap</b> was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria, {{to other parts of}} the Muslim world and to Europe.|$|R
50|$|Aslan is a hotshot {{police officer}} around his early-30s. He {{lost his wife}} in a {{terrorist}} action while serving in the army (It is unknown as what though) against the PKK. He then has a romantic involvement {{with one of the}} other characters (Alev) and this later turns into a serious romance relationship towards the <b>middle</b> of the <b>soap.</b>|$|R
50|$|She {{is rarely}} {{seen at the}} start and she later seems to {{dissolve}} throughout the <b>middle</b> of the <b>soap.</b> She is the sister of Alev. She, at first, was the more younger and casual person. Aggressive and non-responsible, it later affects her life badly. After the bad effect, she decided to put her life straight and studied more.|$|R
50|$|Hilde Proescholdt {{was born}} in Gotha, Thuringia, a {{province}} in central-eastern Germany on October 20, 1898. She was the <b>middle</b> daughter of <b>soap</b> factory owner Ernest Proescholdt and his wife Gertrude. She attended the University of Jena in Germany for two semesters in 1918 and 1919 and then transferred to the University of Frankfurt in Germany where she also spent two semesters. It was here that she saw a lecture by the renowned embryologist Hans Spemann on experimental embryology.|$|R
