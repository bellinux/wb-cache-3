Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock.

25|$|These {{differences}} {{reflect a}} general philosophical difference between Haredi Judaism, which emphasizes strict interpretations {{in order to}} prevent possible transgressions, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is more likely to utilize leniencies rooted in classical rabbinic sources. The difference has tended to increase the social distance between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews, as Haredi Jews who follow the stricter interpretation <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> unable to pray in some Modern Orthodox synagogues. As a result, and consistent with the general increasing influence of Haredi interpretations, many synagogues in recent years have raised the height of their mechitzot in order to accommodate members and guests who follow stricter interpretations.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the {{presence}} of a group can influence one’s perception of these two factors in a number of ways. For instance, working in a group may reduce or increase one’s expectancy of attaining a goal. That is, depending on the qualities of the group members, an individual <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in a group of high achievers who work hard and are guaranteed success, whereas another may equally find themselves in a group of lazy or distracted people, making success seem unattainable. Therefore, the link between one’s personal efforts and success is not direct, as our success is influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the value of the goal may be contingent on the group members. For instance, if we must share the reaping of success with all other group members, then the value of the goal is reduced compared to the value of the goal from an individual perspective. Hence, the dynamic of the group is an important key in determining a person’s motivation and the likelihood of social loafing. Additional factors which have been found to influence the likelihood of social loafing include one’s gender, one’s cultural background and the complexity of the task.|$|E

When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees.

2500|$|BPR {{projects}} {{that are not in}} alignment with the organization’s strategic direction can be counterproductive.

Hence, District Judge Neighbour's reliance in Ong Kian Cheong on the testimonies of a police officer and recipients of the tracts has been criticized as [...] "highly problematic", and {{it has been suggested that}} an objective test needs to be adopted to determine if an act will be offensive to other races or classes.|$|E
2500|$|While {{women are}} also {{affected}} by the family's loss of status, they may simultaneously experience a boost in their own status relative to men because of the greater gender equality present in American society. Men, {{who may have been}} accustomed to filling the role of sole [...] "breadwinner" [...] in their home country <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> unable {{to do so in the}} United States. This is due both to restricted access to jobs and to prevalence of new immigrants in the low-wage sector. Immigrants in these jobs are unlikely to be able to support their entire families solely on their earnings. The increase in the number of female-dominated industries in the United States means that there are often more employment options for women in the low-wage sector than for men. If women begin to take a more active role in financially providing for their family, this is generally accompanied by enhanced status within the family.|$|E
40|$|This paper formalizes {{the role}} of legal {{infrastructure}} in economic development in a general equilibrium model with endogenously determined property rights enforcement. It illustrates the mutual importance of property rights protection and market production by the model’s multiplicity of equilibria. In one equilibrium, property rights are enforced and market activity is unhampered. In the other, property rights are not enforced, which discourages economic activity and leaves the economy without the resources and incentives to enforce property rights. Even identically endowed economies <b>may</b> therefore <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in very different equilibria. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{effort of}} {{maintaining}} {{the role of a}} she-ro can be stressful. [...] The role encourages women to care for others rather than themselves, which the patient may find comforting, but this may lead to the reluctance or inability to ask for help they need or want which can lead to bitterness that their friends and family did not offer these services unbidden. The success of the patient's normalization efforts may paradoxically increase their dissatisfaction, as their apparent ability to handle it all discourages people from offering help. The breast cancer culture celebrates women who display the attitude deemed correct, which implies that their continued survival is due to this positive attitude and fighting spirit. While cheerfulness, hope, and good social support can be advantageous to health outcomes, it cannot determine survival rates. [...] Women who reject the she-ro model <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> socially isolated by the breast cancer support groups that are nominally supposed to help them. Support from [...] "the sisterhood" [...] favors the [...] "passionately pink", and tends to overlook those whose response is incompatible with the pink ribbon culture because it is angry, unhappy, or afraid.|$|E

[...] In a positive review by The Guardian, Steven Poole notes that [...] "The Accidental has an infectious sense of fun and invention. The story goes through some surprising reversals and arrives at a satisfying conclusion, which is also a beginning." [...] Kirkus Reviews called the book [...] "Dazzling wordplay and abundant imagination invigorate a tale of lives interrupted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor wrote [...] "the writing brims with wit, humor, and energy." [...] In a mixed review by 'Bookslut,' Eoin Cunningham wrote [...] "The Accidental ends up more an exercise in cleverness than a story. Equally, the reader’s enjoyment of The Accidental will be inextricably linked to their appetite for such an exercise. If you aren’t swept away by Smith’s undoubted way with words, and you rely on the bones of the story itself, you will be disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Countertransference is {{a common}} problem in {{clinical}} settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> believing that their client’s pathology is [...] "self-evident". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics {{during the course of}} therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients’ sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the [...] "newbie". Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, psychoeducation, and bibliotherapy for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years. Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles {{in the rest of the}} relationship blurs, a [...] "bleed-through" [...] problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial bleed-through.|$|E
