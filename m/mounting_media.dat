Properties of a good mounting medium include having a refractive index close to that of glass (1.518), non-reactivity with the specimen, stability over time without crystallizing, darkening, or changing refractive index, solubility in the medium the specimen was prepared in (either aqueous or non-polar, such as xylene or toluene), and not causing the specimen stain to fade or leach.|$|E

50|$|In GSD microscopy, {{fluorescent}} markers are used. In one condition, {{the marker}} can freely be excited from ground state and returns spontaneously via emission of a fluorescence photon. However, if light of appropriate wavelength is additionally applied the dye can be excited to a long-lived dark state, i.e. {{a state where}} no fluorescence occurs. As long as the molecule is in the long-lived dark state (e.g. a triplet state), it cannot be excited from the ground state. Switching between these two states (bright and dark) by applying light fulfills all preconditions for the RESOLFT concept and subwavelength scale imaging, and therefore images with very high resolution can be obtained. For successful implementation, GSD microscopy requires either special fluorophores with high triplet yield, or removal of oxygen by use of various <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> such as Mowiol or Vectashield.|$|E

Kedrai recommended that a further inquiry be drawn into whether Israeli prison authorities were negligent in his death. After the inquiry, Israel reportedly offered the Zygier family considerable financial compensation for his death. An Israeli official denied that compensation was offered, arguing that none would be necessary until negligence had been proven. In February 2013, in the face of <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> scrutiny, 8 pages of a 28-page report prepared by Judge Kedrai at the conclusion of her inquiry in December 2012, was released to the public.

The judge said [...] "orders had been given to prevent suicide," [...] and that [...] "these orders were not upheld." [...] Judge Kedrai reported that bruises had been found on Zygier's body but could not determine whether they occurred before or after his death. She noted traces of a tranquiliser drug were found in Zygier's body but did not make anything of it. Whilst leaving her findings open, the judge said she could not negate [...] "the active intervention on the part of another person who intentionally caused his death," [...] but her report said this was negated by [...] "the examination of the conditions of imprisonment that denied entry to the cell and the contents of the camera sweeps that negated the entry of another person into the cell." ...|$|E

30|$|Sector hashing has {{limitations}} {{in the following}} cases. First, it cannot detect embedded files, such as photographs in the latest Microsoft Office documents (e.g.,.docx and.pptx files), because the contents are compressed in a ZIP archive file.

Additionally, sector hashing is not supported for encrypted files or encrypted file systems. For encrypted file systems, {{it is necessary to}} decrypt the file system by <b>mounting</b> the <b>media</b> using an appropriate decrypting driver [24].

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in labeling tissues for fluorescence microscopy is minimizing sample processing while maintaining or improving the information generated by the fluorescent label. Generally, tissues are extracted, fixed, and embedded in <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> (such as paraffin), sectioned, and then postprocessed by removing the paraffin, blocking, labeling, and washing. Despite all of these steps, the consistency of labeling quality can vary {{as a result of}} several factors, including heterogeneity in labeling efficiency from slide to slide, the necessity of postprocessing to obtain information on sequential sections of tissue, interference from the <b>mounting</b> <b>media,</b> and loss of native three-dimensional structural information, especially in thicker sections. A method for embedding and processing tissues that have been labeled by intravital staining is described in this study. Intravital staining is the process in which live-cell dyes and other labels are injected into the bloodstream before fixation of the tissues. Tissues processed this way can be imaged upon sectioning without further staining and retain their native, three-dimensional information, thereby improving the information retained by the labels and speeding up sample processing.

40|$|Morphological {{studies of}} small {{invertebrates}} often involve {{the preparation of}} slides to observe minute body parts under a compound microscope. Preparation should facilitate observation, through traditional optical microscopy, of small surface structures on different planes, like pores, spines and setae. Various methods and techniques, using different <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> that specialists have adopted to observe and preserve small crustaceans, have their advantages and disadvantages. Within the order Bathynellacea, specimens in the family Bathynellidae are particularly challenging due to their small size (0. 5 to 2. 25 mm body length) and very delicate exoskeleton, which tends to be completely digested when using common clearing <b>mounting</b> <b>media,</b> making future consultations impossible. Permanent slides are fundamental to preserve small specimens for scientific collections, because temporary slide preparations can easily result {{in the loss of}} body parts in the passage between slide and vial and vice versa. Dr Eugene Serban worked on Bathynellacea for more than 40 years, improving the preparation and preservation of delicate specimens using a stained glycerol-jelly and double cover slip mounting technique. His method is described here with a variation that speeds up the original procedure and was implemented in most recent years by one of the authors (A. I. C.). The technique provides excellent preservation and visualization of body parts on permanent slides, which do not need curation tasks and can last for many years. © 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leide...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging microscopy {{can be used}} {{to study}} protein-protein interactions by Forster Resonance Energy Transfer or to perform lifetime-based multiplexing. Fixation of samples with cells producing fluorescent fusion proteins is commonly used for preservation of samples and for staining with membrane impermeable reagents such as antibodies. However, the effect of fixation methods and <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> on fluorescence lifetime is poorly documented so far. Here, we demonstrate that fixation by formaldehyde or methanol itself does not affect the lifetime of fluorescent proteins produced in cells but that several widely used <b>mounting</b> <b>media</b> decrease the fluorescence lifetime by up to 20 %. It is shown that fixed cells producing Aequorea victoria derived fluorescent proteins mounted in Tris buffer have fluorescence lifetimes indistinguishable from values measured in living cells. Tris buffer also allows accurate Forster Resonance Energy Transfer quantification in fixed cells, as shown with an mTurquoise 2 -SYFP 2 fusion protein. Moreover, identical lifetime contrasts are measured in living and fixed cells mounted in Tris buffer after introducing a single plasmid expressing two lifetime variants of cyan fluorescent proteins, each targeted to different locations in the cell. Our findings will aid the preparation of fixed cells producing fluorescent proteins for reliable measurement of fluorescence lifetimes for Forster Resonance Energy Transfer determination, lifetime based multiplexing and for instrument calibration for standardization purposes...|$|E
