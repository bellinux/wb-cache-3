5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, <b>microphthalmia,</b> progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, <b>microphthalmia,</b> optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), <b>microphthalmia,</b> keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, or retinol, is {{the sole}} vitamin which is {{embryotoxic}} even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the retinoic acid, {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (<b>microphthalmia),</b> ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E

2500|$|Double merle or {{homozygous}} merle {{occurs when}} the offspring of two merled parents inherit two copies of the dominant merle gene. The odds of this are 25% for each pup born from such a litter. Double merles often have excessive white and can have hearing and vision problems {{as a result of}} having two copies of the merle gene. Homozygous merles can be deaf or blind, or express iris colobomas and <b>microphthalmia.</b> Not all homozygous merles are affected, but most are, making the breeding of two merles a very touchy subject. Some breeders euthanize mostly white pups, while others may attempt to sell them as [...] "rare" [...] white Aussies without disclosing the potential for health defects. A large percentage of homozygous merles sold eventually end up in rescue and shelters, as the average family is ill-prepared to take on a deaf or blind pet. However, deaf or blind Australian shepherds can make wonderful pets given a home prepared for their special needs. They are an intelligent breed, which generally learn hand signals with ease.|$|E
2500|$|Retinoic acid via the {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} influences {{the process of}} cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause <b>microphthalmia,</b> defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E
2500|$|Rubella {{is known}} to cause {{abnormalities}} of the eye, internal ear, heart, and sometimes the teeth. [...] More specifically, fetal exposure to rubella during weeks five to ten of development (the sixth week particularly) can cause cataracts and <b>microphthalmia</b> in the eyes. [...] If the mother is infected with rubella during the ninth week, a crucial week for internal ear development, there can be destruction of the organ of Corti, causing deafness. [...] In the heart the ductus arteriosus can remain after birth, leading to hypertension. [...] Rubella {{can also lead to}} atrial and ventricular septal defects in the heart. [...] If exposed to rubella in the second trimester, the fetus can develop central nervous system malformations. [...] However, because infections of rubella may remain undetected, misdiagnosed, or unrecognized in the mother, and/or some abnormalities are not evident until later in the child’s life, precise incidence of birth defects due to rubella are not entirely known. [...] The timing of the mother’s infection during fetal development determines the risk and type of birth defect. [...] As the embryo develops, the risk of abnormalities decreases. [...] If exposed to the rubella virus during the first four weeks, the risk of malformations is 47 percent. [...] Exposure during weeks five through eight creates a 22 percent chance, while weeks nine to twelve a seven percent chance exists, followed by a percentage of six if the exposure is during the thirteenth to sixteenth weeks. [...] Exposure during the first eight weeks of development can also lead to prematurity and fetal death. [...] These numbers are calculated from immediate inspection of the infant after birth. [...] Therefore, mental defects are not accounted for in the percentages because they are not evident until later in the child’s life. [...] If they were to be included, these numbers would be much higher.|$|E

6000|$|The {{organs of}} sight and hearing are {{generally}} admitted to be homologous {{with one another and}} with various dermal appendages; hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction. Mr. White Cowper says [...] "that in all cases of double <b>microphthalmia</b> brought under his notice he has at the same time met with defective development of the dental system." [...] Certain forms of blindness seem {{to be associated with the}} colour of the hair; a man with black hair and a woman with light-coloured hair, both of sound constitution, married and had nine children, all of whom were born blind; of these children, five [...] "with dark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis; the four others, with light-coloured hair and blue iris, had amaurosis and cataract conjoined." [...] Several cases could be given, showing that some relation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears; thus Liebreich states that out of 241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than fourteen suffered from the rare disease called pigmentary retinitis. Mr. White Cowper and Dr. Earle have remarked that inability to distinguish different colours, or colour-blindness, [...] "is often associated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical sounds."
