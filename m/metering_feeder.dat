40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the efforts of}} Stamet, Incorporated, and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to produce an innovative feed system for pressurized combustion power systems. DOE has been fostering the development of pressurized fluidized-bed combustion power systems which are 45 percent efficient and can deliver electricity at 20 percent below the cost of conventional power systems. A major capital cost factor in pressurized systems is the coal and limestone feed systems. DOE has been attempting to reduce the capital and operating cost of these components {{for a number of}} years. In 1995, Stamet, Incorporated, completed a 2 -year Small Business Innovative Research grant from DOE and produced a precision <b>metering</b> <b>feeder</b> capable of delivering coal into a vessel at 210 pounds per square inch, gauge, ({approximately} 14 atmospheres). The feeder is an elegantly simple machine with one moving part. The product provides continuous metering of fuel against pressure with instantaneous rate control...|$|E

40|$|In 1994, Thomson Consumer Electronics (RCA), an {{international}} manufacturer of electronics equipment purchased a UtillTRACK? Monitoring System for {{a plant in}} Indianapolis, Indiana. The system monitored gas and electric <b>meters,</b> substations, main <b>feeders,</b> and major equipment and systems including compressed air. For the compressed air system, monitored data included compressor amps, electrical demand and consumption, pressure and airflow. The resulting UtiliTRACK? reports and graphs showed a significant variation in system efficiency depending upon the demand for air (day of week, time of day, production schedule) and which compressor or compressors were operating. By working with the boiler plant operators and making minor modifications to the existing compressor controls, the operating sequence was modified to maintain high system efficiency under all operating conditions. Monitored data after the changes were made showed a 20 % reduction in compressed air system operating costs...|$|R
40|$|Johnsgard (1979) categorizes the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) as an erratic breeder in {{a number}} of eastern and southeastern Nebraska counties. Ducey (1988) {{considers}} this species to be a regular nester throughout the state in suitable coniferous habitat. Neither authors have listed breeding records in Keith County, although Ducey cites a record from Chase County (Bennett 1986). The Pine Siskin is known as a breeder in 12 counties in Kansas (Thompson and Ely 1992). Methods We caught and banded Pine Siskins at Cedar Point Biological Station near Lake Keystone, Keith County, Nebraska (41 ° 132 ̆ 7 N, 101 ° 382 ̆ 7 W) during June and July, 1993. All individuals were caught in standard 36 mm mesh mist nets, 12 <b>meters</b> long, near <b>feeders</b> containing niger thistle seeds. The nets were set on the hillsides of steep canyons 25 - 35 meters above the level of the lake among an interrupted stand of mixed eastern and western cedars (Juniperus virgiana and J. scopulorum), which were interspersed with warm-season grasses and bare rock outcrops on the Ogallala Sandstone formation...|$|R
40|$|Since privatisation, {{maintenance}} of DNO LV feeder maximum demand information has gradually demised in some Utility Areas, {{and it is}} postulated that {{lack of knowledge about}} 11 kV and LV electrical networks is resulting in a less economical and energy efficient Network as a whole. In an attempt to quantify the negative impact, this paper examines ten postulated new connection scenarios for a set of real LV load readings, in order to find the difference in design solutions when LV load readings were and were not known. The load profiles of the substations were examined in order to explore the utilisation profile. It was found that in 70 % of the scenarios explored, significant cost differences were found. These cost differences varied by an average of 1000 %, between schemes designed with and without load readings. Obviously, over designing a system and therefore operating more, underutilised transformers becomes less financially beneficial and less energy efficient. The paper concludes that new connection design is improved in terms of cost when carried out based on known LV load information and enhances the case for regular maximum feeder demand information and/or <b>metering</b> of LV <b>feeders...</b>|$|R
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas <b>metering</b> station to <b>Feeder</b> No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{subsidies}} for farmers are an expensive legacy of past development policies. The result is overuse of both {{energy and water}} in groundwater-irrigated agriculture?threatening the financial viability of the power sector {{and the future of}} the groundwater resource itself, along with the livelihoods of the millions who depend on it. The most popular solution is the metered tariff, promoted by international donors and many of India?s state governments. But metering is the ideal solution only if the cost of metering and billing 14 million scattered, small users in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is ignored. Easier, more feasible and more beneficial in the short run in many parts of South Asia would be the use of a rational flat tariff, which avoids the transaction costs and strong farmer opposition associated with metering. The flat-tariff option has been ignored because, in its current incarnation, it has proved a complete failure. However, combined with intelligent power supply rationing, it is a logical, viable alternative which could cut wasteful groundwater use by 12 - 18 km 3 per year in Western and Peninsular India alone. The approach would involve (1) gradually raising tariffs to cut power utility losses; (2) supplying farms with fewer hours of power per year, but ensuring a quality power supply during periods of moisture stress; and (3) <b>metering</b> at the <b>feeder</b> level to measure and monitor farm power use, to allow good management...|$|R
40|$|Data {{analytics}} in {{smart grids}} can be leveraged to channel the data downpour from individual meters into knowledge valuable to electric power utilities and end-consumers. Short-term load forecasting (STLF) can address issues vital to a utility {{but it has}} traditionally been done mostly at system (city or country) level. In this case study, we exploit rich, multi-year, and high-frequency annotated data collected via a metering infrastructure to perform STLF on aggregates of power meters in a mid-sized city. For smart meter aggregates complemented with geo-specifi c weather data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, including kernel methods for nonlinear regression, seasonal and temperature-adjusted auto-regressive models, exponential smoothing and state-space models. We show how STLF accuracy improves at larger <b>meter</b> aggregation (at <b>feeder,</b> substation, and system-wide level). We {{provide an overview of}} our algorithms for load prediction and discuss system performance issues that impact real time STLF. © 2014 Alcatel-Lucent. in the distribution network. Customers may also gain better awareness of their own consumption patterns. In this paper we report a study on demand predic-tion, where we analyzed near real time power con-sumption monitored by tens of thousands of smart meters in a medium-size U. S. city. We developed and adapted several short-term forecasting methods for predicting the load at several levels of aggregation. In this context, short-term load forecasting (STLF) refers to the prediction of power consumption levels in the next hour, next day, or up to a week ahead. Within this time scope, one can have reliable weather fore-casts, which provide important input to the predic-tion, as historically the load in this city is highly infl uenced by weather because electricity is used for both heating and cooling...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{benefits}} of information technologies were assessed at farm level {{by means of}} a dynamic probabilistic simulation model. The model included biological performances with respect to oestrus detection and concentrate feeding. In this way, main {{benefits of}} activity <b>meters,</b> automated concentrate <b>feeders</b> and on-line automated parlour systems for recording of milk production and milk temperature could be estimated. In comparison with the default situation, improvement in oestrus detection from 50 % to 90 % increased gross margin by Dfl. 1. 28 per 100 kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) per year under Dutch production conditions. This equals 8. 0 % of a farmer's typical net return to labour and management. Using an individual feeding system increased gross margin by Dfl. 0. 77 per 100 kg FPCM per year and the net return to labour and management by 4. 8 %. Feeders increased the frequency of concentrate provision from two to four times a day. Moreover, a more accurate performance-related concentrate provision was achieved from total daily amount in portions of 1 - 0. 1 kg. In addition feeders enabled the possibility of overcoming the limited concentrate intake for high-producing animals in the milking parlour {{in the beginning of the}} lactation. A more accurate milk production estimation increased gross margin and the net return to labour and management by Dfl. 0. 17 per 100 kg FPCM and 1. 1 % respectively. In the latter case equilibrium feeding was compared with a feeding method in which concentrate supply was based on an standard deviation of 5 % in the estimated energy requirements for milk production. The results of this study will be used to evaluate theoretically the economic viability of the investigated IT applications...|$|R
