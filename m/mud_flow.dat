At the Hong Kong International Airport, over 200 flights were delayed {{due to the}} threat of the storm; additionally, around 30 were canceled, and 66 others were deviated elsewhere. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a standby warning signal on April 17, which was the second earliest standby signal on record. [...] One day later, the No. 3 strong wind signal was issued, the earliest in record. As it moved ashore, the storm brought heavy rainfall, with one station reporting 237mm (9.35in) in one day. Strong winds downed coconut and banana trees, with agricultural damage totaling over ¥200million (2008RMB, $28million 2008USD). Structural damage amounted to ¥96million (2008RMB, $14million 2008USD). Three fatalities were confirmed in China, two due to a road being covered in a <b>mud</b> <b>flow,</b> and another due to winds blowing a sheet of aluminum into a person, throwing them off the roof of a stadium.|$|E

40|$|Our {{long-term}} scientific goal is {{to develop}} sound theoretical models for submarine sediment movement {{that can be used}} to predict the initiation, spatial development, and time duration of <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> and turbidity currents. Of particular interest are the characteristics of the sedimentary deposits that these flows generate as well as their capability to develop submarine channels and gullies via bed scour in continental margins. OBJECTIVES The main objectives are: 1) to study the effect of sediment discharge, sediment size and density, and bottom slope on the evolution of three-dimensional <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> and turbidity currents "representative" of those expected to occur on continental shelves and slopes, 2) to study the nature of the sediment deposits generated by three-dimensional turbidity currents and <b>mud</b> <b>flows</b> and 3) to develop a sediment erosion function for the submarine environment. APPROACH Large-scale laboratory experiments have been used to observe the behavior of three-dimensional turbidity currents and <b>mud</b> <b>flows.</b> Sediment erosion by swift, unsteady flows has also been the subject of several laboratory experiments with the help of a special purpose facility.
