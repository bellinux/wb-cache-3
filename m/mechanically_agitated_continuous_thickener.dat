40|$|The {{biotechnological process}} of {{vanillin}} production from vanillic acid by Pycnoporus cinnabarinus was scaled-up at the laboratory level. Vanillin production was studied in {{two types of}} bioreactors, a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> and an air-lift bioreactor. In the <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> bioreactor where vanillin was produced in greater quantities, oxygen availability was studied during the growth and production phases. A maximal aeration rate (90 l/h equivalent to 0. 83 volume of air/volume of medium/min or vvm) during the growth phase and a minimal aeration rate (30 l/h equivalent to 0. 28 vvm) during the production phase were necessary to increase vanillin production to 1260 mg/l. Vanillic acid bioconversion to vanillin occurred under the conditions of reduced dissolved oxygen concentration, gentle agitation, high carbon dioxide production and low specific growth rate. However, under these conditions, vanillin production {{was accompanied by a}} significant amount of methoxyhydroquinone. Vanillin over a concentration of 1000 mg/l was shown to be highly toxic to the growth of P. cinnabarinus on agar medium. The application of selective XAD- 2 resin led to a reduction of vanillin concentration in the medium, thus limiting its toxicity towards the fungal biomass as well as the formation of unwanted by-products such as methoxyhydroquinone and allowed the concentration of vanillin produced to reach 1575 mg/l...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} area achem in a gas-liquid contactor {{as determined by}} the chemical method deviates from the true geometrical {{interfacial area}} ageo, because the overall conversion of the gas phase reactant represents an incorrect average if bubble sizes and residence times are not uniform. The deviations of achem fromageo become larger the broader the distribution τb/db and the higher the overall conversion ΩA of the reactant in the gas phase. Model calculations, which take into account both the effect of gas phase backmixing as well as the effect of bubble coalescence on the deviation of achem from ageo, are performed for a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> gas—liquid reactor and a bubble column at practical micro- and macromixing conditions. For a gas-liquid model reaction, which is first-order in the gas phase reactant, it is found that: (1) for a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> reactor the error in achem will always be smaller than 10 % if ΩA is lower than 0. 99, and (2) for a bubble column the error in achem will be smaller than 20 % for most practical applications if ΩA is lower than 0. 99.

40|$|Mineral {{flotation}} in <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> vessels (cells) involves {{complex interaction}} between bubbles, particles and the liquid phase. Ideally, just enough power {{input from the}} impeller is needed to so that the frequency of particle–bubble collision and attachment is maximised, {{while at the same}} time detachment events are minimised. This paper firstly investigated how the slip velocity of 2 – 10 mm diameter bubbles, a size commonly encountered in flotation devices, was influenced by turbulence intensity. The measurements confirmed the earlier correlation by [Lane, G. L., 2005, Numerical modelling of gas–liquid flow in stirred tanks, Ph. D. Thesis, University of Newcastle, Australia], which was then inputted into a computational fluid dynamic model to describe the gas dispersion in a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> tank. The model provided turbulence intensity values that were then coupled with both slip velocity and criticalWeber number models to generate both bubble size and gas holdup profiles for the entire vessel. Moreover, a simple equation was introduced to allow prediction of cavity formation behind the rotating impeller blades, which is a common occurrence in most flotation cells they normally operate at high gas loadings. This inclusion allowed the model to predict power reduction resulting from the presence of the cavities. Finally, extension of the computational model to include flotation hydrodynamics, such as probabilities of collision, adhesion and stabilisation of the particles at the bubble surface, is also described. The model is able to compute net attachment rates, and hence the particle flux entering the froth recovery phase, as a function of bubble and particle diameter, gas flowrate and power input...|$|R

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} includes the processes of exploration, extraction, upgrading, separation, refining, transporting and marketing oil products. After the separation process, water is removed to a great extent, and only a small percentage is left in the crude oil. When marketing the products, the value is essential, and therefore a representative sample has to be extracted to determine the quality. This requires that the water is uniformly distributed throughout the batch when it is evaluated. FMC Technologies requested a mixing system that would be able to achieve a homogeneous flow in a pipeline, for a range of parameters. Because a laminar flow is the most challenging to mix, the parameters which gives the lowest Reynolds number are chosen as a worst case scenario. By literature studies, it is stated that a uniform mixture can be provided by multiple processes. <b>Mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> vessels, static- and power mixing have been analyzed. The static mixer is evaluated based {{on the state of the}} art, and a power mixing system is designed for the worst case parameters. Calculations are performed to be able to evaluate. It is found that <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> vessels are not recommended for in-line mixing and therefore not evaluated further. Pressure drop is expensive, and this is taken into account when discussing a conclusion. A static mixer is recommended for Reynolds numbers below 2000 and a main pipe diameter below 0. 4 m. No mixing is required when the Reynolds number reaches a certain peak where the turbulence in the flow is of a large extent and mixing will happened naturally.

40|$|Phenomena {{that involve}} the {{settling}} of particulates {{in a host}} fluid are encountered in many practical systems which find applications {{in many areas of}} industry. A numerical model has been developed to simulate the settlement of non-flocculated particulate suspensions in batch sedimentation. The non-flocculated mode of the model is extended to predict the performance of a <b>continuous</b> gravity <b>thickener.</b> The various particle species within the particulate susepnsion are represented as separate phases with distinct concentrations and velocities. A multiphase representation of the settling process gives greater detail of the interactions present between the particulates. The build up of the sediment as well as a prediction of the compression point for flocculated suspensions, is modelled using a revised version of packing theory. The build up of floes in the free setting region is incorporated via population balances.

40|$|<b>Mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> {{vessels are}} widely used for various mixing {{operations}} within {{a wide range of}} industries including the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and petroleum industries. They are used for liquid blending, solid-liquid mixing, gas dispersion in liquids, heat/mass transfer enhancement and chemical reaction. Mixing is intrinsically a Lagrangian process and, whilst Eulerian data are essential, Lagrangian information is necessary for its complete description. Possible approaches of generating Lagrangian data can, in principle, employ numerical simulations or experimental techniques based on Lagrangian tracking to provide the trajectories of fluid elements or solid particles. In this work a set of tools are developed for the analysis and theoretical validation of Lagrangian single and multi-phase flow data obtained from tracer trajectories in <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> vessels. Whilst theoretical procedures developed here exploit a large range of mathematical and statistical concepts with Shannon entropy being an example, the computational data analysis often involved handling and sequential processing of multidimensional matrices containing several millions of data points. Computational codes were developed for performing Lagrangian statistical data analysis, Lagrangian-Eulerian data conversion, Shannon entropy analysis, multi-phase mixing studies and detailed Eulerian multi-plane investigations. The implementation and power of these tools are demonstrated by analysing a wide range of measurements acquired using the technique of positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) during the mixing of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, as well as the mixing of highly concentrated solid-liquid systems. These multi-phase suspensions included monodisperse, binary and polydisperse solid-liquid suspensions. Experimental measurements obtained in these systems are unique and valuable in their own right as, for the first time, it has been possible to determine the full 3 D velocity and concentration fields of liquid and solid phases within opaque dense slurries of this type containing up to 40 wt% solids.

40|$|Interfacial {{areas and}} gas hold-ups have been {{determined}} at pressures up to 8. 0 MPa in a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> gas—liquid reactor and a bubble column with {{a diameter of}} 81 mm for superficial gas velocites between 1 and 5 and 1 and 10 cm/s, respectively. The interfacial areas have been determined by the chemical method using the model reaction between CO 2 and aqueous diethanolamine (DEA). Contrary to earlier reported results on interfacial areas in a <b>mechanically</b> <b>agitated</b> reactor at pressures up to 1. 7 MPa, a positive influence {{of pressure on the}} interfacial areas has been observed for higher pressures and higher superficial gas velocities. The product of the gas density G and the superficial gas velocity at the orifice υG, or was found to be an important parameter for the manifestation of the pressure effect. For values of GυG, or larger than 200 kg/m 2 s the interfacial areas increase with increasing reactor pressure. Below this value of 200 kg/m 2 s no influence of pressure could be observed. The gas hold-ups in the bubble column in water as well as in an aqueous solution of DEA with antifoam increase with increasing pressure. This pressure effect on the gas hold-up in bubble columns originates from the formation of smaller bubbles at the gas distributor. The relative increase in the gas hold-ups is smaller in water and also if a porous plate instead of a perforated plate is used as gas distributor. The differences in the magnitude of the pressure effect are caused by differences in the coalescence behaviour of the gas bubbles in both liquids and by differences in the bubble formation process at the two types of gas distributors, respectively. The interfacial areas in the bubble column also increase with increasing pressure. The relative increase in the interfacial areas aP/aatm with increasing pressure may be as large as 200 % for a pressure increase from P = 0. 15 to 8. 0 MPa, {{depending on the type of}} gas distribution and the superficial gas velocity used...|$|R
