40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis {{marked the beginning}} of worldwide efforts to improve the effectiveness of financial supervision. However, the crisis that started in 2007 – 08 was a crude awakening: several of these improvements seemed unable to avoid or mitigate the crisis. This paper brings the first systematic analysis of the role of two of these efforts— modifications in the architecture of financial supervision and in supervisory governance— and concludes that they were negatively correlated with economic resilience. Using the emerging distinction between macro- and <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> we explore to what extent two separate institutions would allow for more checks and balances to improve supervisory governance and, thus, reduce the probability of supervisory failure...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the privileged}} {{explanations}} of the current crisis is the sophistication and the weak transparency of financial markets which would have allowed speculative behavior to elude authorities’ supervision. This article develops a different view by putting {{the emphasis on the}} model of organization of financial systems. This is established on the predominance of <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> schemes following the hypothesis of free market efficiency. From 1980 - 90, prudential mechanisms have worked in favor of self-regulation models and the systemic stability is mainly founded on the individual security of banking institutions. We show that this orientation suffers from the fallacy of composition; the micro-prudential model turns out to be unsuitable for the management of systemic risks because of the absence of an automatic bridge between the micro and the macroeconomic levels. The new regulatory environment feeds then successive bubbles the recurrence of which seems to require a modification of the rules of organization to avoid the forced socialization of the losses of private actors. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is clear}} that a banking union at the European level is a gain, {{but it is not}} a {{solution}} for all the problems that have been revealed by the last financial crisis. Although the Single Rulebook uniforms banks' risks management and <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> the macro-prudential components contained are reduced and academically challenged. The question of Member States outside the Eurozone on the participation within the Single Supervisory Mechanism is when is the right moment and not if, since there is an implicit horizon for joining the Eurozone and thus to the mechanism. For these Member States, where the banking system is dominated by banking groups supervised by the European Central Bank, entering into a close cooperation with the Single Supervisory Mechanism does not appear to be a necessity, given that national supervision authorities are applying the Single Rulebook, and cooperation between national authorities and the European Central Bank is clearly established...|$|E
40|$|The 2007 - 8 global {{financial}} crisis {{brought to the}} fore {{a new era of}} liquidity risk. Governments around the globe were forced to intervene to preclude a complete collapse of their respective financial and banking systems. The failure of financial supervision was in part caused by segments of the financial system being either inadequately regulated or unregulated. Thus far the international response - including in Hong Kong - has focused on regulatory tools. However, does this approach reflect the prudent management of liquidity risks which threaten financial stability? This thesis will analyse the optimum supervisory model to manage the financial stability of Hong Kong’s banking system when exposed to substantial liquidity risks. The key elements necessary - financial stability, liquidity, and financial supervision of the banking and monetary systems – will be analysed to form a theoretical basis to determine the optimum supervisory model. Supervisory and regulatory issues influencing the relationship between financial supervision and the regulatory toolkit shall be examined in detail under three broad themes, the unified sectoral supervisory structure, integrated and cross-sectoral supervision, and systemic supervision. Unified sectoral supervision will concentrate on the issue of central banking and whether this should be unified or separated from banking supervision when managing market liquidity. The analysis reveals that the HKMA’s constrained monetary policy powers impairs the capacity to manage financial stability. Further market liquidity tools can be successfully implemented by a central bank without a banking supervisory ambit. A unified structure was beneficial to mitigate co-ordination frictions between supervisors. There was no perceived advantage between the Integrated and Sectoral supervisory models when planning the implementation of market liquidity facilities. However the HKMA’s cross-sectoral supervisory ambit is subject to structural biases with the supervision of hybrid financial instruments suffering from micro-prudential underlap. This flaw can adversely affect the supervision of universal banks’ liquidity ratios. The HKMA is susceptible to a market conduct bias similar to the United Kingdom’s Integrated model. The HKMA does not capture systemic liquidity risks outside the banking system. Systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap and frictions arise between the HKMA and the Financial Stability Council. The HKMA’s supervision of banks’ short-term liquidity ratios is impeded by systemic cross-sectoral <b>micro-prudential</b> underlap. <b>Supervision</b> of OTC derivative financial infrastructure is constrained by the SFC’s and HKMA’s systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap. This underlap encapsulates all financial sectors outside the HKMA’s supervisory ambit, notably the shadow banking system. Renminbi infrastructure is subject to a systemic macro-prudential underlap between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China. <b>Micro-prudential</b> Renminbi banking <b>supervision</b> is inhibited by a supervisory underlap between the HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Despite the HKMA’s supervisory structure reflecting Hong Kong’s banking and monetary systems, the design is structurally flawed when exposed to substantial liquidity risks which threaten financial stability in the banking system. On balance, the optimum supervisory model to manage liquidity risks in Hong Kong’s banking system is the Twin Peaks model. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-loose {{monetary}} policies, such as {{very low}} or even negative interest rates, large-scale asset purchases, long-maturity lending to banks and forward guidance in central bank communication, aim to increase inflation and output, {{to the benefit}} of financial stability. But at the same time, these measures pose various risks and might create challenges for financial institutions. • By assessing the theoretical literature and developments in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, where very expansionary monetary policies were adopted during the past six years, and by examining the euro-area situation, we conclude that the risks to financial stability of ultra-loose monetary policy in the euro area could be low. However, vigilance is needed. • While monetary policy should focus on its primary mandate of area-wide price stability, other policies should be deployed whenever the financial cycle deviates from the economic cycle or when heterogeneous financial developments in the euro area require financial tightening in some but not all countries. These policies include <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision,</b> macro-prudential oversight, fiscal policy and regulation of sectors that pose risks to financial stability, such as construction...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has ignited {{a debate about}} the appropriate objectives and the governance structure of Central Banks. We use novel survey data to investigate the relation between these traits and banking system stability focusing in particular on their role in <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> We find that {{the separation of powers}} between single and multiple bank supervisors cannot explain credit risk prior or during the {{financial crisis}}. Similarly, a large number of Central Bank governance traits do not correlate with system fragility. Only the objective of currency stability exhibits a significant relation with non-performing loan levels {{in the run-up to the}} crisis. This effect is amplified for those countries with most frequent exposure to IMF missions in the past. Our results suggest that the current policy discussion whether to centralize prudential supervision under the Central Bank and the ensuing institutional changes some countries are enacting may not produce the improvements authorities are aiming at. Whether other potential improvements in prudential supervision due to, for example, external disciplinary devices, such as IMF conditional lending schemes, are better suited to increase financial stability requires further research...|$|E
40|$|Now the ECB {{will become}} {{responsible}} for <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> {{there are consequences}} for its primary mandate. Separating these two tasks may be necessary. Conceptually, both functions are related and a mutual prerequisite in the short- but especially the long-term. However, clear conflicts of interest may arise when the ECB is both bank supervisor and monetary policymaker; we cannot be sure {{which of the two}} functions will prevail. To solve this we need to separate the two functions by either setting up a Supervisory Board, operating independently within the ECB, or by appointing national supervisors as alternates to NCB governors in the Council. In both cases, a member of the ECB’s Executive Board should be responsible for supervision and the ECB should have a new solvency instrument orthogonal to the interest rate, for early intervention in potential problem banks. This is, however, not the ultimate solution to the problem, as ECB president Draghi will be ultimately responsible for both monetary policy and supervision. In the end both should be independent from each other as well as from politics, coupled with clear accountability. Only when supervision is not influenced by politics it can be optimal...|$|E
40|$|The new {{own funds}} {{adequacy}} device, officialy named “ International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards”, describes {{the most important}} benchmark framework for <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> at the moment. The publication of the final text in June 2004, {{after five years of}} deliberations, represents the result of multiple analyses and comments provided by all interested parties, banking supervision authorities, associations and credit institutions. Provided the development of complex methodologies of risk measurement and management, on a large scale, by credit institutions, simple and static rules of the first accord have become less and less relevant during the last years. And so, the need of setting up a own funds adequacy framework which is much more risk sensitive and provides incentives to credit institutions on what concerns the improvement of risk measurement and management systems was met by approval of the Basel II Accord, which will, therefore, lead to the strengthening of financial stability. The revisal of the Accord was mainly focused on the increase of risk analysis and internal measurement and the changes made to their estimation allow banks to create their own methodological framework to calculate capital requirements (also considering each credit institution’ risk appetite) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} and theoretical developments, which arose after the global crisis, {{have produced a}} profound reappraisal of the central banks’ contribution in achieving and maintaining financial stability. This evolution has had important consequences for the institutional architecture of financial supervision and for the role assigned to central banks within it. At the same time, the key role played by central banks during the crisis in helping to stabilise financial systems with conventional and unconventional measures was probably a deciding factor in politically legimising their their greater involvement in financial supervision, whose prevailing micro-prudential approach {{was one of the}} main causes of the crisis itself. The policies for financial stability, which go from crisis prevention to crisis management, and which may involve not merely banks and the payment system, but also every sector in the financial system, blurred the limits of responsibility held by the central banks and their dealings with other regulators: especially with governments, on the one hand, and the authorities in charge of traditional <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> on the other.

40|$|Abstract. - The {{economic}} crisis, {{which has}} been with us since 2008, has called into question the supervision and financial regulation model in the European Union (EU). The economic governing system, which was born after the creation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EEMU), {{has been shown to be}} clearly insufficient in order to deal with the impact of the recession which has hit the twenty seven Member States of the EU. This situation has illustrated the need for a wider cooperation between the States, some supervisory institutions with a more systematic vision and a better designed and more specific financial system. The objective of this article is to analyze the modifications which have been made to the supervision model of the European financial system, the problems which have resulted and the lines of improvement which must be studied if the intention is that the supervision model of the European financial system is going to be a trustworthy, efficient and effective model in the future. To do this, the changes in the renovation of the financial supervision model in the EU, which have been made since 2011, will be studied. In the first place, the macro-prudential and <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> through the restructuring of the three fundamental bases of the financial system will be analyzed: banking system, market values and insurance. Secondly, a critique of the model will be carried out and the most problematic points of the system will be outlined in order to highlight areas which need improving and finally, the conclusions will be presented...|$|E
40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability. In this context, the financial crisis {{has proved to be a}} major challenge to the ongoing process of European financial integration. In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting cross-border financial groups, questioned the ability of the EU financial stability architecture to contain threats to the integrated single financial market. In particular, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of coupling to <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> a macro dimension aimed at a broad and effective monitoring and assessment of the potential risks covering all components of the financial system. In Europe, following the de Larosière Report, the European Commission has put forward proposals for establishing a European System of Financial Supervision and a European Systemic Risk Board, the latter body to be set up under the auspices of the ECB. While the details for the implementation of these structures still need to be spelt out, they should reinforce significantly – ten years after {{the introduction of}} the euro – the financial stability architecture at the EU level...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{consensus on}} the role of central banks has eroded. The pursuit of the goal of price stability only is now insufficient to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. A new paradigm emerges in which central banks should ensure price stability, growth and financial stability. Recent institutional developments of the ECB go in this direction since it will {{be in charge of the}} <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision.</b> In addition, the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area shows that the ECB also remained attentive to the evolution of economic growth. But if the ECB implements its triple mandate, the question of the proper relationship between these missions still arises. Coordination between the different actors in charge of monetary policy, financial regulation and fiscal policy is paramount and is lacking in the current architecture. Besides, certain practices should be clarified. The ECB has played a role as lender of last resort (towards banks and, to a lesser extent, towards governements) although this mission was not allocated to the ECB. Finally, in this new framework, the ECB suffers from a democratic illegitimacy, reinforced by the increasing role it plays in determining the macroeconomic and financial balance of the euro area. It seems important that the ECB is more explicit with regard to its different objectives and that it fulfils the conditions for close cooperation with the budgetary authorities and financial regulators. Finally, we call for the ex nihilo creation of a supervisory body of the ECB, which responsibility would be to discuss and analyze the relevance of the ECB monetary policy...|$|E
40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis made clear the shortcomings in the European structure of financial supervision. In the cur­rent system of financial supervision the financial supervi­sor {{of the home}} Member State is in principle the only autho­rity entitled to supervise financial institutions even in case the institution operates across borders. If the home financial supervisor does not effectively supervise the financial insti­tution, this failure could affect clients and creditors in other Member States. The bankruptcy of Icelandic banks was felt by accountholders in the United Kingdom and the Nether­lands. The shortcomings in the Icelandic Deposit Guaran­tee scheme 1 threatened to expose these depositors to losses on their savings {{that should have been}} covered by that sche­me. In the end, the UK and the Dutch government guaran­teed these deposits under the applicable deposit-guarantee scheme. However, the problems arising in the execution of the agreement concluded between the UK, Dutch and Icel­andic government to recover the UK and Dutch taxpayers’ money from Iceland show the enormous consequences of failure in local supervision. Despite their significant relevan­ce in the current crisis, in this article I will not address these problems in <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> of banks. This ar­ticle focuses on the mechanism to ensure consistent applica­tion by the different national supervisors of the harmonised set of conduct of business rules, in particular, the rules laid down in the Prospectus Directive 20032 and the Transparen­cy Directive 2004. 3 In order to solve the shortcomings in the European struc­ture of financial supervision, the European Commission pro­posed to create a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) consisting of national supervisors and three new su­pranational European Supervisory Authorities. A Superviso­ry Authority for the banking sector 4, one for the insurance and pensions sector 5 and a supranational European Supervi­sory Authority to ensure compliance by financial institutions with conduct of business rules and the orderly functioning of the securities market. 6 The national financial supervisors remain the principal supervisory authorities. However, the supranational authorities will get decisive authority in case of emergency or continued non-agreement between national supervisors. In these cases the supranational authorities will have the authority to address directly financial institutions that do not comply with the European financial services and financial supervision legislation. In this article I will analyse in paragraph 2 the current struc­ture of financial supervision. In paragraph 3 I will discuss the de Larosière-report on the {{financial crisis}} and the present shortcomings in European financial supervision will be dealt with. Paragraph 4 provides a brief overview of the reaction of the European Commission to this report. In paragraph 5 I will describe the proposals of the European Commission. Paragraph 6 discusses the proposed future powers of the Eu­ropean Securities and Markets Authority to ensure compli­ance with the European rules on the prospectus and financi­al reporting. In paragraph 7 the proposed amendments of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Moneta­ry Affairs will be discussed. In paragraph 8 some concluding remarks are provided...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the European {{financial}} system has been characterized by large scale, deep, irreversible changes in its structure, due to deregulation and concentration processes. The growing competitive pressures have forced financial intermediaries to rethink strategic and organizational choices {{in order to achieve}} better performance. Globalization and the financial crisis emphasize the problems caused by worldwide banking structures and require a reassessment of groups’ development strategies. Given the importance and centrality of the consolidation processes for the European financial industry, the goals of this book are:- to analyze the concentration process in the European financial system and its implications for the strategic evolution of the banking industry, the corporate governance of intermediaries and regulation and financial supervision;- to investigate the consolidation processes both in the banking industry and in the financial markets (Stock Exchange industry);- to focus on cross-border concentration processes in the European context. This book is the outcome of research undertaken by three groups of academics, from the Universities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Udine and Verona, as part of a National Research Project (PRIN) financed by the Universities themselves and the Italian Ministry of Education, entitled ‘Financial intermediaries cross-border and cross-sector concentration processes in Europe: regulatory, strategic and management issues and value creation’. The central theme is the general process of consolidation, and the M&A operations in particular, widespread in the financial sector since the early Nineties of the last century, and responsible for a radical transformation of the structural characteristics of the banking and financial systems in both Europe and the United States. The main drivers of this process have been the liberalisation and integration of the European market and, in more general terms, the IT revolution and the globalisation of financial markets worldwide. The subject of consolidation in the financial sector, focus of attention for large numbers of academics and operators in many countries over a considerable time, has recently acquired even greater significance {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis. For a long time, favourable macroeconomic conditions meant that the positive aspects of these processes were most in evidence, especially the new availability of financial services to the mass market, the expansion of the range of services benefiting more or less all categories of clientele and, probably, a tendency to an increase in the efficiency of both markets and systems. However, the resulting formation of very large banking and financial groups, operating at the cross-border level and subject only to constraints and controls which all proved to be more or less ineffectual and inefficient, generated huge concentrations of risks and levels of correlation responsible for the spread of the recent financial crisis across almost the entire globe. On the one hand, the crisis revealed the obstacles to the success of banks’ M&A-based growth strategies, while on the other it highlighted the pitfalls of the creation of very large, complex groups, certainly capable of achieving synergies and competitive advantages, but also generating negative effects with regard to operating efficiency, groups’ governance and control, and the rationality of the structures themselves. Banking consolidation processes, and the body of M&A operations through which they have taken place, are thus being reviewed today in the light of utterly new facts and processes, which on the operational level have led to the largest mobilisation of public resources ever seen, and on the intellectual scene are catalysing the attention of vast numbers of analysts and academics all over the world. This book focuses on the consolidation process that has taken place within the financial system of the European Union. One distinctive feature of this process in the case of Europe is the growing number of cross-border and cross-sector M&As, a key factor in the integration of the credit and financial markets. Unfortunately, this process has not been accompanied by the introduction of effective regulation and supervision for the groups formed, an asymmetry made all too clear at the peak of the financial crisis, by the implosion of two of Europe's largest cross-border, cross-sector groups, Fortis and Dexia, and the subsequent rescue operations. The book consists of 12 chapters, which together cover the subject of consolidation in the banking, insurance and stock exchange sectors, with some specific discussions of topics relating to regulation and supervision. The strong focus on the banking sector reflects its central role in all Europe’s financial systems. The first two chapters provide a general description of the phenomenon. Chapter 1 sets out to provide a general definition of the consolidation process in the banking-financial industry by outlining the course of events in both the European Union and the USA. It defines the types of operations carried out (cross-border and cross-sector) and then discusses their aims, motivations and drivers. This is followed by a survey of the main negative consequences of the banking consolidation process, and the body of M&A operations through which it has taken place, overlooked in the literature but made starkly obvious by the crisis. It is thus clear that the subject of consolidation is destined to remain at the centre of the debate on banking and finance for a long time to come. Chapter 2 offers a broad survey of the vast literature of theoretical and empirical studies on financial sector consolidation that has appeared since the mid Nineties, discussing findings for the USA, European and international markets. The two chapters which follow analyse the implications and consequences of financial sector M&As. Chapter 3 considers the measurement of a number of effects of consolidation operations in the financial industry, concentrating in particular on the degrees of internationalisation of systems and strategic diversification, and the measurement of value creation. Chapter 4 is an empirical analysis of the effects of banking consolidation operations in terms of shareholder value and risk, with in-depth discussion of the role of the phenomenon’s cross-border and cross-sector dimensions. The survey is conducted on a large, comprehensive and original list of M&A operations concluded from 1997 to 2007 by banks and insurance companies from EMU countries, with a focus on a sample of listed firms from this group. The three chapters which follow basically cover consolidation amongst the large groups which form the top tier of banking systems. Chapter 5 reports on the dynamics of the consolidation of major European banking groups during the period 2000 - 8, and provides an overview of the expansion policies pursued by these groups in recent years. It also considers the impact of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. The study includes the top fifteen European banking groups by stock market capitalisation and total assets, with two Spanish, three French, three British, two Swiss, one Dutch, two Italian and two German banks. Chapter 6 studies a fairly recent aspect which is however of major of importance for the future evolution of the largest banking and financial groups in both European and North America, partly in the light of the crisis: the changes in their ownership structure, concentrating in particular in the role of the Sovereign Wealth Funds, most of them from non-European states. This is done by analyzing the 44 most important global banking groups in terms of capitalization and total assets. Twenty-three groups are based in Europe, 18 in the United States and Canada, and three in Japan. One smaller bank, Standard Chartered, is also included following the massive recapitalization of the group by SWFs. Chapter 7 focuses on an equally specific topic which is also extremely important, especially for large banking groups: the possible links between growth, bank size and operational risk. The aim is to examine the dynamics of operational risk during consolidation by seeking to identify changes in the quality and quantity of operational risk in the newly merged group compared to the pre-merger situation. A case study is presented, dealing with the two largest Italian banking groups: Unicredit Group and Intesa SanPaolo. The next two chapters are on the subject of regulation and supervision, an urgent priority given the events of the financial crisis. Chapter 8 considers the insurance sector, and especially the outcomes of the geographical diversification of insurance companies and the implications of the capital regime to be introduced by the Solvency 2 framework, now being asked to bridge the gap between regulation and business operations. Europe’s legislators are currently hard at work on this framework, which although scheduled for implementation in 2012 is still struggling to achieve a standard approach for the financial requirements, supervisory review process and market conduct of European insurers and reinsurers. Chapter 9 discusses the regulation and supervision of cross-border groups operating in the EU in the light of the crisis. It outlines the existing regulatory and supervisory framework and highlights the imbalance between it and the development of cross-border groups and the inadequacies that have come to light, before discussing the cases of Dexia and Fortis, the two most dramatic European banking group collapses. It then moves on to a critical examination of the main reforms on the drawing board, especially those put forward by the de Larosière Report, with its proposals for the establishment of two pillars: <b>micro-prudential</b> <b>supervision</b> and macro-prudential supervision. The two chapters which follow cover consolidation in the stock exchange sector. Chapter 10 studies the ongoing moves to merge the main markets, investigating their drivers and implications. The focus is on the European stock exchange consolidation process fostered by the new regulatory framework introduced by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). The evidence is twofold: even though there is a continuous process of consolidation in the stock exchange industry, barriers to entry continue to fall and new competitors obtain authorization to operate as Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs). However the crisis has hit banks, the main shareholders of MTFs, hard, thus slowing down the rate of start-ups. Chapter 11 concentrates on the effects on the market consolidation process in terms of the governance and value both of the markets themselves and of the companies which operate them. An empirical analysis is carried out on the valuation criteria adopted in the most recent stock exchange mergers (mainly NYSE Group and Euronext; London Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana). Value drivers are examined, in particular the relationship between operational exchange volumes and economic-financial dynamics. Moreover, stock exchange pricing is related to the specific governance structure resulting from exchange mergers. Chapter 12 discusses the integration of systems and markets, with particular attention to the problems arising from the widespread obstacles to the regulation of international operations, and the possible solutions. The analysis reveals that the existing regulatory framework on matters affecting the regulation of cross-border transactions appears to be not only incomplete, but also incapable of provide a satisfactory level of certainty. At the European level, the problems posed by the crises hitting intermediaries working in a multiplicity of legal contexts require the adoption of the necessary reforms by member states, thus opening the way to truly international standards, complete solutions for the regulation of cross-border settlements. The research findings were presented at a workshop at the University of Verona. The comments received and the subsequent discussions provided useful input for the final drafting of the various articles. Thanks in particular to Roberto Tedeschi and Prof. Francesco Vella...|$|E
