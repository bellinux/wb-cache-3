50|$|Durum wheat {{semolina}} or flour, common farina or flour, or {{combination of}} both is mixed with water and eggs (for egg noodles) and other optional ingredients (like spinach, tomato, herbs and etc.). Usually 25-30 kg of water is added per 100 kg of semolina. The amounts are measured by computerized dispensers. The mixture is then kneaded by auger extruder equipped with <b>mixing</b> <b>paddles</b> and kneading blades to obtain a homogeneous mass, and after that is extruded through various shaped dies. Drying process begins immediately after the products are shaped to prevent deformation and sticking. The pastas are dried completely in drying chambers and stabilized, then ready for packaging. In modern factories, dry pasta is processed using automatic continuous lines.|$|R

The <b>mixed</b> <b>paddle</b> and screw leviathan, the Great Eastern, built in the late 1850s, was so obviously before her time by some fifty years, and was so under-powered for her size, that she may be left out of our reckoning. Thus, to speak roughly, the 1850s saw the iron screw replacing the wooden paddle steamer; the later 1860s brought the compound engine, which effected so great an economy in fuel that the steamship, previously the conveyance of mails and passengers, began {{to compete with the}} sailing vessel in the carriage of cargo for long voyages; the 1870s brought better accommodation for the passenger, with the midship saloon, improved state-rooms, and covered access to smokerooms and ladies cabins.|$|R

Although DM is currently used for excavation control in numerous projects, no standard procedure has been developed and the different applications have not been evaluated. As this technique emerges as a more economical and effective alternative to traditional excavation shoring, {{there is a need for}} guidelines describing proven procedures for evaluation of design, analysis and construction.

40|$|Fine-grained (≤ 2 mm) {{sedimentation}} of streams {{can cause}} detrimental impacts on ecological quality. However, {{there is currently}} little information on the quantity and spatial variability of fine-grained sediment (FGS) stored in river channels. As a result, there are few baseline data available to evaluate {{the success of any}} measures designed to reduce FGS supply, and by extension FGS storage (e. g. catchment land management). There is, therefore, a need for a reliable in-stream monitoring technique to quantify FGS storage. This research, which was based in the East Midlands, developed and employed a field-based methodology for determining FGS storage in stream channels. The method used a combination of sampling a given volume of bed material using a McNeil corer, and a resuspension technique using a streambed shear stress achieved with a <b>mixing</b> <b>paddle</b> attached to a cordless electric drill. FGS storage was evaluated in riffles and pools of Stonton Brook (42 km 2), Eye Brook (61 km 2) and the Upper Welland (53 km 2). FGS was found to be dominated by sand-sized particles. The mean average at-a-site storage in the Upper Welland, the Eye Brook and Stonton Brook were 4977 ± 511 g m- 2 cm- 1, 5710 ± 437 g m- 2 cm- 1 and 4626 ± 342 g m- 2 cm- 1, respectively. FGS storage in pools exceeded that of riffles. Surficial remobilisable storage of fines was also higher in pools than riffles. The organic matter content of the FGS was low, and showed little variation between pools and riffles. The baseline data set collected could be used in the future to evaluate the success or otherwise of catchment land management interventions in reducing the quantity of fine sediment stored in the streams investigated...|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the optimal {{conditions}} for composting and factors influencing microbiological changes during the Composting of Eucalyptus bark in the production of a plant growth medium. A bench-scale composter was designed to provide strict control over air composition, moisture content, temperature and mixing. The composter consisted of six 4 -L capacity gas-tight units of PVC plastic, each of which was provided with a <b>mixing</b> <b>paddle</b> coupled to a common drive. A natural temperature rise was simulated by having the units immersed in a water bath, with the temperature increased at rates consistent with those observed in large-scale compost heaps. This provided a companitively inexpensive versatile system, with rates of CO 2 and CH 4 production and 02 consumption automatically monitored by gas chromatography. Levels of volatilized NH 3 and nitrogen oxides (NO.) were manually monitored from acid traps. The reproducibility of the system was as good as the best reported. Optimal conditions for the bench-scale composting of eucalypt bark were considered to be a temperature of 55 0, on aeration rate of at least 20 mL min - 1 and an initial C:N ratio of 25 - 30, depending on the availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen, in decreasing order of availability, was provided in the form of urea, isobutylidene diurea (IBDU), fish wastes or sewage cake. Both respiratory activity and nitrogen loss data were considered to be of value in determining the economic as well as the microbiological optimal C:N ratio of bark compost. No further amendment other than water (giving an initial moisture content of 1147. d. w. basis) was found to be necessary. Ammonification and NH 3 volatilization occurred during the first sixteen days of composting while volatilization of NO was substantial during times of undesirable nitrogen availability. Delaying ammonification in the urea amended composts (by either the addition of quinone or urea's replacement with IBDU) increased ammonia volatilization. Net nitrification followed peak net ammonification, but nitrate appeared to be produced largely chemically rather than biologically. Volatilization of NO. was greatest from compost prepared using sewage cake. Up to five peaks of CO 2 output were observed over a 30 day run, three occurring during the transition to thermophilic conditions and one or two peaks occurring during a plateau temperature of 55 0. The predominant flora comprised Bacillus spp. during the mesophilic and early thermophilic phases (B. brevis and B. sphaericus followed by B. circulans and B. brevis then B. circulans, B. sphaericus or B. stearothersophilus). Bacillus spp. continued to predominate throughout the composting of sewage-bark and most of the fish-bark composts. However, actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp. and Thernomonospora spp.) and coryneforms predominated at latter stages of urea-bark composts. Strictly anaerobic bacteria appeared to be unimportant during the composting of bark. The predominant flora isolated during the mesophilic phase were not inhibited by compost components of any age, while members of the climax flora were inhibited by fresh compost components. Cellulase activity was not correlated with peaks in CO 2 output, but showed a slow increase or decrease, depending on the initial C:N ratio, over 30 days composting. However, lipase activity correlated with the peak in CO 2 output at about day sixteen in a fish-bark compost. The identification of thermophilic Bacillus spp. was aided by a study of their esterase mobilities and the use of numerical taxonomy. Phenolic compounds present after 30 days composting were phytotoxic. However, levels of residual ammonium could largely account for the phytotoxicity exhibited by water extracts from most of these composts. Eucalypt bark composts had a higher density than pine-bark composts or peat moss, but were as good as or better than the latter materials with regard to their water characteristics and particle-size distribution...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuously}} <b>mixed,</b> aseptic <b>paddle</b> mixer {{was used}} successfully for solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus oryzae on whole wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improved temperature control and prevented inhomogeneities in the bed. Respiration rates {{found in this}} system were comparable to those in small, isothermal, unmixed beds, which showed that continuous mixing did not cause serious damage to the fungus or the wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improves heat transport to the bioreactor wall, which reduces the need for evaporative cooling and thus may help to prevent the desiccation problems that hamper large-scale SSF. However, scale-up calculations for the paddle mixer indicated that wall cooling becomes insufficient at the 2 -m 3 scale for a rapidly growing fungus like Aspergillus oryzae. Consequently, evaporative cooling will remain important in large-scale mixed systems. Experiments showed that water addition will be necessary when evaporative cooling is applied {{in order to maintain}} a sufficiently high water activity of the solid substrate. Mixing is necessary to ensure homogeneous water addition in SSF. Automated process control might be achieved using the enthalpy balance.

The objective was to prepare ammonium uranium fluoride double salts from uranium dioxide and ammonium bifluoride, then decompose these salts to uranium tetrafluoride through heating to temperatures near 425 'C in either a fluidized bed or a stirred bed. Fluorination in the stirred bed was attempted without pretreatment of the reagents. For the fluidized bed experiments, reagents were ball-milled prior to being heated in the bed.

40|$|Solid-state {{fermentation}} (SSF), i. e. {{cultivation of}} micro-organisms on moist solid substrates {{in the absence}} of free-flowing water, is an alternative for submerged fermentation (SmF) for the production of biotechnological products. In recent years, research on SSF has led {{to a wide range of}} applications on lab scale, and comparative studies between SmF and SSF claim higher yields and other advantages for products made by SSF. In spite of these examples the commercial application of SSF processes in Western countries remains unusual mainly due to problems associated with scale-up. This thesis aims at solving one the most important scale-up problems, which is the simultaneous control of temperature and moisture content in a large-scale bioreactor. The use of mixed bioreactors for SSF was considered the first step in solving scale-up problems with respect to temperature and moisture-content control. Continuous mixing improved temperature control and prevented inhomogeneities in the bed. Respiration rates found in this system were comparable to those in small, isothermal, unmixed beds, which showed that continuous mixing did not cause serious damage to the fungus or the wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improved heat transport to the bioreactor wall, which reduced the need for evaporative cooling and thus may help to prevent the desiccation problems that hamper large-scale SSF. However, scale-up calculations for the mixed bioreactor indicated that wall cooling will become insufficient at a scale of 2 m 3 for a rapidly growing fungus like A. oryzae. Consequently, evaporative cooling will remain important in large-scale mixed systems. Experiments showed that water addition is necessary when evaporative cooling is applied, to maintain a sufficiently high water activity of the solid substrate. Evaporative cooling is very important for large-scale bioreactors. However, it seriously dehydrates the solid substrate and will limit fungal growth. Water has to be added during fermentation to control the moisture content. A model is described, which estimates the extracellular (nonfungal) and overall water contents of wheat grains during solid-state fermentation (SSF). Model parameters were determined using an experimental membrane-based model system, which mimicked the growth of A. oryzae on the wheat grains and permitted direct measurement of the fungal biomass dry weight and wet weight. The model can be used to calculate the water addition that is required to control the extracellular water content in a mixed solid-state bioreactor. A control strategy is presented for simultaneous control of the temperature and moisture content during SSF in a continuously <b>mixed</b> <b>paddle</b> bioreactor. Evaporative cooling with varying air flow rate was applied to control the temperature of the solid substrate. The extracellular water content was controlled by adding a fine mist of water droplets onto the mixed solid substrate, using the water balance model to calculate the required addition based on on-line measurements. Temperature and extracellular water content were successfully controlled, which resulted in an improved biomass production compared to similar fermentations with temperature control only. No negative effects of water addition were observed with regard to biomass production. Control aimed at constant extracellular water content was shown to be superior to control aimed at constant overall water content of the fermented solids. The use of 1 H-NMR imaging is described as a powerful technique to study solid-state fermentation at particle level. Gradients inside substrate particles cannot be prevented in solid-state fermentation. We report gradients in moisture and glucose content during cultivation of A. oryzae on membrane-covered wheat-dough slices, which were calculated from 1 H-NMR images measured in vivo. We found that moisture gradients in the solid substrate remain small when evaporation is minimized. This is corroborated by predictions of a diffusion model. In contrast, strong glucose gradients developed. Glucose concentrations just below the fungal mat remained low due to high glucose uptake rates, but deeper in the matrix glucose accumulated to very high levels. Integration of the glucose profile gave an average concentration close to the measured average content. Based on published data, we expect that the glucose levels in the matrix cause a strong decrease in water activity. The results demonstrate that NMR can play an important role in quantitative analysis of water and glucose gradients at the particle level during solid-state fermentation, which is needed to improve our understanding of the response of fungi to this non-conventional fermentation environment. Finally, an overview is given of recent advances in process control in large-scale SSF systems. In addition, two commercially available bioreactors are discussed with respect to process control: the koji bioreactor and alternative bioreactors based on industrial solid mixers, which both can facilitate the scale-up of SSF...|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Production Facility has a 10 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous}} mixer that mixes the premix dry feeds and low-level waste salt solution to make fresh (uncured) saltstone. Inspection of the mixer in January 2013 showed significant wear on the third, {{fourth and fifth}} paddle pairs after the conveying augers. A 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous mixer}} {{was used to test}} alternate paddle configurations for use in the 10 -inch mixer to decrease the wear rate on the paddles. Two wear tests were conducted to investigate a method of reducing wear on the mixer paddles. The first test (wear test 2 a) had a paddle configuration similar to the currently installed 10 -inch mixer in the SPF. This test established baseline wear. The second test (wear test 2 b) had a reconfigured paddle arrangement that replaced the flat paddles with helical paddles for paddle pairs 2 � 6 and aligned paddle pair 1 with the augers. The intent of the reconfiguration was to more effectively convey the partially wetted dry feeds through the transition region and into the liquid feed where paddle wear is reduced due to dry feeds and salt solution being mixed at the intended water to premix ratio. The design of the helical paddles provides conveyance through the transition region to the liquid feed inlet. The alignment with the auger is aimed to provide a smoother transition (minimizing the discontinuity between the auger and paddle pair 1) into the downstream paddles. A soft metal with low wear resistance (6000 series aluminum) was used for the wear testing paddles to determine wear patterns while minimizing run time and maximizing wear rate. For the two paddle configurations tested using the scaled 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto continuous mixer, with the first six paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles and the remaining paddles were stainless steel. Since the 10 -inch SPF mixer is designed with the liquid inlet centered over paddle pairs 5 and 6, the scaled 2 -inch mixer was configured the same way. The wear rate from wear test 2 a was approximately double the wear rate from wear test 2 b for paddle pairs 4 and 5. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on paddle pairs 1, 2, 3 and 6 based on mass change, indicating that the un-wetted and fully wetted premix materials cause less wear than the partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles showed more deformation on the flat paddles than the helical paddles which was consistent with the wear rates. Aligning of the auger discharge flight with paddle pair 1 resulted in a lower wear rate paddle pair 1 rather than having them misaligned with the feed augers. During the paddle wear tests, polishing wear was observed on the inside barrel of the mixer. The polishing wear is evident on the upper housing clamshell and the lower housing clamshell primarily at paddle pairs 4 and 5, which is the transition region of the mixer. Wear on the mixer barrel increases the space between the paddles and the barrel, resulting in increased grout build up on the barrel. Since the mixer barrel cannot be reconfigured or replaced in the SPF, the method for mitigating wear on the barrel is to move the more viscous grout through the transition region as quickly as possible. In addition, the location of the liquid inlet does not allow for sufficient cleaning of the mixer since residual grout remains on paddle pairs 1 � 4. As the paddles continue to wear and the self-cleaning capability of the paddles is lost, the lack of sufficient flushing would aid in grout build up between the barrel and the paddles which could eventually lead to decreased throughput capacity of the dry feeds. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in no change to the rheological properties of the grout mixture. Both tests produced a grout that is within the processing range of the SPF. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended for the currently installed SPF mixer that paddle pairs 1 through 6 be helical rather than flat, with the paddle pair 1 aligned with the feed augers in order to minimize the wear occurring in the SPF mixer. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended that the mixer be inspected and critical measurements be taken whenever the SPF processing schedule allows in order to establish a wear rate of the 10 -inch mixer paddles. 5 Based on these measurements, the lifetime of paddles in the transition region can be established in order to set up a maintenance schedule for the mixer. Since replacing the entire mixer is very expensive and time intensive, replacing the worn paddles after a specific time period would allow for planned shutdowns as well as process optimization such that the mixer throughput is not compromised. In addition, further testing should be performed to determine an alternate liquid inlet location to better flush the mixer of residual grout at the end of processing. Sufficiently cleaning the mixer will help eliminate another potential source of wear. Another potential method for reducing the wear rate in the mixer is to reduce the mixer speed without affecting the throughput capacity. Since wear rate is a function of impact velocity of the grout and <b>mixing</b> <b>paddles,</b> testing could be done using the 2 -inch mixer determine the optimum mixer speed to reduce wear but not adversely impact facility operations (e. g. throughput capacity and grout properties) ...|$|R

The feed industry standard is a %CV of less than 10 using a single source tracer such as salt, trace minerals or iron filings. The {{uniformity of}} mix can be affected by many factors including ingredient properties, equipment design, mix time, sampling method, sample preparation and overall precision of method. The objectives of this thesis were to verify the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method and {{to determine the effect}} of extended mixing time, salt particle size, sample preparation, wet mix time, spray condition, application time of the liquid addition, percent liquid addition and mixer type on the uniformity of mix. The first experiment evaluated the effect of water temperature, technician, extraction time, dissolution time on the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The salt concentration was significantly affected by water temperature and dissolution time. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the 60 ºC water temperature and the 30 s extraction time by stirring followed by immediately placing the strip into the solution after extraction should be used for the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The second experiment evaluated the effect of extended mix time, particle size of salt and sample preparation on the %CV. The extended mix time did not result in segregation (P > 0. 30). However, particle size of the salt and sample preparation significantly affected the uniformity of mix. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that the extended mix time of up to 60 minutes did not increase the %CV of the feed; the particle size of the salt used in the uniformity of mix test can significantly change the results of the test; and grinding the sample prior to analysis improved the precision of the Quantab® chloride titrator method when coarse salt is used in the manufacturing process. The third experiment evaluated the effect of wet mix time and the timing of the liquid addition using different spray conditions on the %CV. The wet mix time significantly changed the %CV of the mixture (P = 0. 0057). The use of a spray nozzle had no effect on the %CV of the feed mixture when a 1. 14 % of a 23 % saline solution was sprayed on to the feed (P = 0. 7435). The results of Experiment 3 indicated the wet mix time had a greater influence on the uniformity of mix than the type of nozzle used to apply the liquid; and the shorter liquid application time allowed more time for the mechanical shear of the ribbons and paddles to break up the agglomerated wet particles and distribute them throughout the feed mixture when the total time of the liquid addition plus wet mix time was fixed. The fourth experiment evaluated the effect of different percent liquid addition, application time and mixer type with different wet mix times on the uniformity of mix. The %CV of feed mixed using a fixed wet mix time setting did not change when the percent liquid addition was increased, while the %CV of the feed mixed using a fixed total liquid mix time setting increased when increasing the percent liquid addition. The %CV of feed mixed with a ribbon mixer did not change when the liquid application time was decreased while the %CV of the feed <b>mixed</b> with a <b>paddle</b> mixer increased when decreasing the liquid application time. Differences were observed in the %CV based on the parameters of liquid cycle time, mixer type and mixer size. The results of Experiment 4 indicated the liquid addition time and the percent of liquid addition affected the uniformity of mix. The uniformity of liquid application should be tested with the highest percent liquid addition. Furthermore, application and wet mix times should be determined for each mixer type and size to establish the optimal batch cycle...|$|R
