2500|$|Though {{this element}} of {{cognitive}} liberty is often {{defined as an}} individual’s freedom from state interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual’s mental [...] "inner realm".

Successful analgesia demands a comprehensive appreciation for the etiologies of pain, vigilant clinical assessment, and personalized treatments. For the critically ill, frequent threats to <b>mental</b> and bodily <b>integrity</b> magnify the experience of pain, challenging clinicians to respond swiftly and thoughtfully. Because pain is difficult to predict and physiologic correlates are not specific, self-report remains the gold standard assessment.

Patient-tailored analgesia aspires to mitigate suffering while opti-mizing alertness and cognitive capacity. Mindfulness of the neuropsychiatric features of pain helps the ICU clinician to clarify limits of traditional analgesia and identify alternative approaches to care. Armed with empirical data and clinical practice recommenda-tions to better conceptualize, identify, and treat pain and its neuropsychiatric comorbidities, the authors (psychiatric consultants, by trade) reinforce holistic approaches to pain management in the ICU.

Caregivers experience stress when patients cannot cope with the symptoms they are experiencing. The stress experienced by caregivers gives rise to psychological and physical symptoms. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the attitude of coping with stress of family caregivers of cancer patients. Methods: This study was conducted as a descriptive research at the Medical Oncology Clinic. The study sample group comprised of 127 family caregivers. In the collection of the data, the Personel Information Form and Attitude of Coping with Stress Inventory were used. Results: The coping attitude used most frequently by family caregivers was active planning, and the least used coping attitude was avoidance isolation (biochemical). There was no significant statistical difference between the coping attitude depending on the descriptive characteristics of the family caregivers (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Results show that family caregivers of cancer patients tend to choose effective coping methods. However, there were still caregivers that displayed ineffective coping attitudes. Therefore, it is important to support the effective coping attitudes of caregivers and intervene in order to change the ineffective coping attitudes...|$|R
40|$|BCI (brain-computer interface) {{systems for}} motor control process {{patterns}} of brain activity and translate them into signals which enable one to replace, restore, or improve impaired motor capabilities. BCI operation involves sustained interactions {{of the central}} nervous system with computational and robotic systems that are themselves capable of adaptive behaviors. This fact molds distinctively BCI ethical issues. Indeed, experimental BCI therapies for motor rehabilitation target directly brain areas and raise special informed consent and medical beneficence issues {{in view of the fact}} that the functional implications of brain plasticity are not fully understood and are difficult to predict. Similarly, epistemic limitations concerning the future behaviors of adaptive BCI systems shape ethical reflection on retrospective distribution of responsibilities and liabilities for damages caused by BCI-actuated devices. Novel ethical issues arise in connection with more distant prospects for BCI enhancement of unimpaired motor capabilities. Ethical policy formation about BCI-enabled enhancements appears to be premature in view of technological lack of imminence. Nevertheless, watchful monitoring of BCI research is presently called for, in order to anticipate prospective ethical tensions between the claims of personal freedom to enhancement and the claims deriving from social justice, fairness, and <b>mental</b> and physical <b>integrity</b> considerations. On the whole, BCI systems afford unique potential solutions for protecting the autonomy, the action, and even the thinking capabilities of people affected by severe motor impairments. However, trust building between BCI researchers and various groups of stakeholders requires the development of communication strategies which enable one to appreciate the rapid advancements in BCI research without underestimating at the same time the formidable challenges one has to meet before various forms of BCI-enabled communication and motor control become more widely available...|$|R

The researchers used appropriate statistical methods of frequencies, percentages, standard deviations, arithmetic means, and evaluation estimates. The study found that the paragraphs of the student’s admission were obtained average and weak evaluation estimates, which is an indication of the weakness of the admission policy in the Faculties of Education in Libyan. In addition, the study revealed that the programs and policies of the student’s admission were not implemented. Thus, the researchers put forwards a set of recommendations, among which, they recommended to choose and select the best of the applicants, who are willing to practice teaching, besides attracting the most intelligent, knowledge, and skilled applicants.

40|$|The idea of {{integrity}} {{of a human}} being is the object of interest of the human rights doctrine as well as of psychology and other social sciences. References to it are made i. a. by different currents in personalism or by the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. The American Convention on Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights proclaim the protection {{of integrity}} of an individual. In documents originating in the United Nations the notion of <b>mental</b> and physical <b>integrity</b> of an individual's personality appeared in connection with considerations on scientific and technological development, which according to the Proclamation of Teheran of 1968, was to be with in the focus of the United Nations' special attention. In the first place, the considerations aim at discovering whether the notion of integrity {{of a human being}} gives rise to any separate value to be protected and if so, whether this protection should {{take the form of a}} new human rights standard. The first question finds the affirmative answer. The analyses of meanings ascribed to the said notion allow to conclude that the human being's integrity may be described by means of the following words: identity — indyviduality of a human being, his/her psychical and physical autonomy, and psycho-physical equilibrium. As to the second question, the author states that integrity understood in the above way is nowadays protected by many separate, already existing rights, the scope of which may, or rather should, be enriched as the need arises. The protection of the said value can also be seen in a methodological approach, according to which human rights should be expressed in a complex way and their categories should not be arranged in a hierarchical order. Attention should also be paid to establishing a specific protection of human being's integrity by means of the instrument of general principle rather than that of subjective right. The former seems to correspond better with the wide scope and complex contens of the said value, which possesses a character of general category. Besides, in favour of the former instrument speaks also the function such categories play in the human rights protection. Namely, this protection have reached — so to speak — a new twist in the spiral of its development. While at the birth of the human rights idea one dealt just with general categories (life, freedom, property, happiness and equality), they were soon defined in terms of particular rights, very numerous today. The human rights protection became subject to atomization. More and more often an individual who claims his interests is forced to found his/her action not on one human right, nor on several such rights simultaneously, but he/she may even need to reach into the space between the boundaries of separate rights. This is where the present tendency to integrate the human rights protection comes from. In turn, the above general categories, forming the framework of the individual's rights, may perform the function of linking factors in building the said integration. The principles referring to such rights, addressed in the first place to the organs applying the law, may serve as interpretative directives referring to the whole body of human rights and as a basis for interpreting the catalogue of means of the individual's protection when the application of separate rights failsDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
