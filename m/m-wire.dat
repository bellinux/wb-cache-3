Eight kinds of NiTi rotary instruments with sizes of ISO # 25 were selected: ProFile, K 3, and One Shape for the conventional alloy; ProTaper NEXT, Reciproc, and WaveOne for the <b>M-wire</b> alloy; HyFlex CM for the controlled memory- (CM-) wire; and TF for the R-phase alloy. Torsional fracture and cyclic fatigue fracture tests were performed. Products underwent a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The CM-wire and R-phase groups had the lowest elastic modulus, followed by the <b>M-wire</b> group. The maximum torque of the <b>M-wire</b> instrument was comparable to that of a conventional instrument, while those of the CM-wire and R-phase instruments were lower. The angular displacement at failure (ADF) for the CM-wire and R-phase instruments was higher than that of conventional instruments, and ADF of the <b>M-wire</b> instruments was lower. The cyclic fatigue resistance of the thermomechanically treated NiTi instruments was higher.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} 3 decades, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) {{instruments}} {{have become an}} important part of the armamentarium for shaping phase of root canal treatment. NiTi endodontic files have increased flexibility and strength compared with stainless steel instruments, but they seem to be vulnerable to fracture in clinical situations. Many variables might contribute to file separation, but the 2 main causes are cyclic fatigue and torsional stress. Heat treatment (thermal processing) is one of the most fundamental approaches toward adjusting the transition temperatures of NiTi alloys and affecting the fatigue and torsional resistance of NiTi endodontic files. In recent years, novel thermo-mechanical processing and manufacturing technologies such as controlled memory wire (CM-wire), <b>M-Wire</b> and electrical discharge machining (EDM) have been developed to optimize the microstructure of NiTi alloys and their mechanical properties. Aim of this work was to investigate the torsional resistance (maximum torque load, and angular rotation) of NiTi instruments made by different thermo-mechanical and manufacturing processes. One-hundred new Hyflex EDM One- File (# 25 / 0. 08, CM-wire and EDM process), WaveOne Primary (# 25 / 0. 08, <b>M-wire),</b> ProTaper Next X 2 (# 25 / 0. 06, <b>M-wire),</b> Hyflex CM (# 25 / 0. 06, CM-wire) and F 6 SkyTaper(# 25 / 0. 06, conventional NiTi) files were used. Torque and angle of rotation at failure of new instruments (n = 20) were measured using a torsiometer according to ISO 3630 - 1 for each brand. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test and the Student- Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. The fracture surface of each fragment was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Files made by CM wire size # 25, 0. 06 taper (Hyflex CM) showed same torque load and angular rotation to fracture than conventional NiTi (F 6 SkyTaper) (P >. 05); instead CM files (manufacturing by grinding or EDM process) recorded lower maximum torque load (P. 05) but significantly higher angular rotation (P <. 05) to fracture than <b>M-wire</b> instruments size # 25, 0. 06 taper (ProTaper Next). Hyflex EDM One-File and Hyflex CM have same torque load and angular rotation to fracture than F 6 SkyTaper due to the higher flexibility and cross-sectional area of CM files tested than conventional NiTi one. Moreover CM files showed lower torque load and higher angular rotation to fracture than <b>M-wire</b> instruments due to the flexibility of CM alloy. <b>M-wire</b> instruments showed same torque load but significantly lower angular rotation than conventional NiTi files due to the same flexibility and higher cross-sectional area of the files tested...|$|E

Subjects and Methods: Forty simulated S‑shaped canals in resin blocks were instrumented with two traditional (ProTaper, Sendoline S 5) and two <b>M‑wire</b> (WaveOne, GT series X) NiTi systems according to the manufacturers ’ instructions. Ten resin blocks were used for each system. Pre ‑ and post‑instrumentation images were captured using a stereomicroscope and superimposed with an image program.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate cyclic flexural fatigue resistance of GT series X rotary files made from the newly developed <b>M-wire</b> nickel-titanium alloy compared with GT and Profile nickel-titanium files made from a conventional nickel-titanium alloy. METHODS: Fifteen files, size 30 / 0. 04, of each type were used to evaluate the cyclic flexural fatigue resistance.

RESULTS: The results of this experiment indicated that the GT series X files had superior cyclic flexural fatigue resistance than the other 2 file types made from a conventional nickel-titanium alloy (P =. 004). On the other hand, the difference between the Profile and the GT files was not statistically significant.

Eighty GT® Series X(TM) files of 25 mm length were divided into eight groups of ten, one for each of the new GT® Series X(TM) files. Eighty original ProFile® GT® files of 25 mm length were divided into eight groups of the same tip and taper sizes consistent with the GT® Series X(TM) file groups. Files were rotated at 300 rpm.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different torsional preloads on cyclic fatigue resistance of endodontic rotary instruments made by conventional nickel–titanium (NiTi) or <b>M-Wire.</b> Methods: Eighty new Mtwo (# 25 / 0. 06) (Sweden & Martina, Due Carrare, Padova, Italy) and ProTaper Next X 2 (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were used. The Torque and distortion angles at failure of new instruments (n =  10) were measured and 0 % (n =  10), 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % (n =  20) of the mean ultimate torsional strength as preloading condition were applied according to ISO 3630 - 1 for each brand.

After torsional preloading, the number of cycles to failure was evaluated in a simulated canal with 60 ° angle of curvature and 5  mm of radius of curvature. Data were analyzed using 2 -way analysis of variance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed to {{evaluate the}} fracture surface of each fragment. Results: ProTaper Next X 2 reduced their cyclic fatigue after 25 or 50 cycles of every torsional preloading (25 %, 50 %, and 75 %) (P <  0. 01).

Methods: Two NiTi rotary instruments with similar geometries and equal cross sections, Pro File GT (GT) and a GT Series X (GTX), were selected. The latter file {{is made from}} <b>M-Wire,</b> a NiTi alloy that, according to its manufacturer, has been thermomechanically processed to have larger flexibility at body temperature. The mechanical response was studied {{for a series of}} static bending and torsional loads by using finite element (FE) models.

Root canal preparation techniques may cause postoperative pain. The goal {{of the present study}} was to compare the intensity and duration of postoperative pain when using WaveOne or ProTaper Universal systems for instrumentation of root canals. Methods: Forty-two patients who fulfilled specific inclusion criteria were assigned to 2 groups according to the root canal instrumentation technique used, WaveOne or ProTaper Universal. Root canal treatment was carried out in 2 appointments, and the severity of postoperative pain was assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS) score after each session until complete pain relief was achieved. Analgesic consumption, duration of pain, and root canal preparation time were also recorded. Results: The mean NRS score and duration of pain after both appointments were significantly higher in the WaveOne group (P <. 05); however, the mean analgesic consumption was only significantly higher in the WaveOne group after the first appointment (P <. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the cyclic {{performance}} of two different Ni-Ti endodontic rotary files made from different alloys under bending using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). When experimentation is not available, this is not a trivial task and most papers on the subject rely on static analysis only. Two Ni-Ti rotary instruments are selected, ProFile GT and a GT Series X (GTX). The latter file is made from <b>M-Wire,</b> which has been thermo-mechanically processed to have larger flexibility, according to its manufacturer.

Although not fully reflective of the instrument???s behavior in a dynamic rotation intra-canal system, the models used constitute a good approximation when a comparison between two instruments is at stake. It is shown that the GTX file has a lower risk of fatigue fracture during its clinical use when compared to the GT file, especially when the root canal makes the file deform into an extreme geometry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the fact that any <b>m-wire</b> electrical system can be modelled as m-equivalent Thevenin voltages and impedances when viewed from any node. The dissertation describes how to calculate the optimal distribution of currents, so a specific amount of power can flow through and reach the network equivalent Thevenin voltages with minimal losses. The optimal current distribution method uses a recently patented method which calculates the optimal currents for each of the wires which are shown to be obtained from the Thevenin parameters and power flow at any instant in time at any node. Once the ideal currents are found, these can be obtained by active and passive devices to inject a specific amount of power (positive and negative) as to compensate existing currents. The focus is particularly on the proof of concept by simulations and physical experiments with work not specifically described in the patent with more emphasis on the optimisation to active compensation. It is explained and shown how this can be implemented using the Malengret and Gaunt method. This method reduces the cost in application where not all the currents need to be processed through a converter (e. g. inverter) but only the difference between the existing and desired optimal currents.

40|$|Introduction Recent {{improvements}} in alloys, kinematics, and concepts have been combined {{to increase the}} cyclic fatigue resistance of nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cyclic fatigue resistance of new <b>M-Wire</b> reciprocating WaveOne (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and Reciproc (VDW GmbH, Munich, Germany) files at 2 levels. Methods Sixty Reciproc and 60 WaveOne new files were fixed to a specifically designed device and tested in tempered steel canals with a 3 -mm radius and a 60 Â° angle of curvature. The motor used was programmed as defined by each manufacturer, and the specific reciprocating motion was followed. Thirty files of each brand were tested at 5 mm, and 30 were tested at 13 mm from their tips. The time to failure was registered. Weibull analysis was used to calculate the mean life, beta, and eta parameters. Results The probability of the mean life was higher for Reciproc than WaveOne files at both levels, with the probability of the Reciproc mean life being 62 % higher than that of WaveOne at 5 mm from the tip and 100 % higher at 13 mm (all statistically significant). The probability of the mean life was higher at 5 mm than at 13 mm in both systems. The results may have been partially conditioned by the different motions that manufacturers propose for each system. Conclusions Reciproc files were more resistant to cyclic fatigue than WaveOne files at both distances from the tip. Both systems had greater cyclic fatigue resistance at 5 mm than at 13 mm from the tip...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{finite element}} method (FEM) has been {{proposed}} as a method to analyze stress distribution in nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments but has not been assessed {{as a method of}} predicting the number of cycles to failure (NCF). The objective {{of this study was to}} predict NCF and failure location of NiTi rotary instruments by FEM virtual simulation of an experimental nonstatic fatigue test. Methods: ProTaper Next (PTN) X 1, X 2, and X 3 files (DentsplyMaillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland (n = 20 each) were tested to failure using a customized fatigue testing device. The device and file geometries were replicated with computer-aided design software. Computer-aided design geometries (geometric model) were imported and discretized (numeric model). The typical material model of an <b>M-Wire</b> alloy was applied. The numeric model of the device and file geometries were exported for finite element analysis (FEA). Multiaxial random fatigue methodology was used to analyze stress history and predict instrument life. Experimental data from PTN X 2 and X 3 were used for virtual model tuning through a reverse engineering approach to optimize material mechanical properties. Tuned material parameters were used to predict the average NCF and failure locations of PTN X 1 by FEA; t tests were used to compare FEA and experimental findings (P <. 05). Results: Experimental NCF and failure locations did not differ from those predicted with FEA (P =. 098). Conclusions: File NCF and failure location may be predicted by FEA. Virtual design, testing, and analysis of file geometries could save considerable time and resources during instrument developmen...|$|E
40|$|Reciprocating {{instruments}} {{made from}} <b>M-wire</b> alloy {{have been proposed}} {{to reduce the risk}} of fracture. No information is available on the surface alteration after single and multiple uses in root canals. Two reciprocating NiTi instruments were used on extracted teeth up to three times. ESEM/EDS analysis was conducted to determine defects, alterations, and wear features of the apical third of instruments and metallographic analysis was performed on the cross-section of new and used instruments to compare alloy properties. Topography of apical portion was evaluated by AFM before and after uses. Extracted single-rooted teeth were divided into two groups and instrumented according to the manufacturer's recommendations with: (A) WaveOne Primary and (B) Reciproc R 25. Each group was divided into three subgroups according to the number of canals instrumented: 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Chi square test was performed to verify homogeneity of defects distribution and GLM to evaluate the differences of RMS at baseline and after use for both groups (α level 0. 05). No instrument fractured and no spiral distortions were observed under optical microscope even when the number of uses increased. Not significant differences were found for WaveOne and Reciproc. Blades presented a wrapped portion in WaveOne group and a more symmetrical feature in Reciproc group. Metallographic analysis revealed in both groups the presence of twinned martensitic grains with isolated flat austenitic areas. Both instruments demonstrated limited alteration, such as tip deformation and wear. This study confirmed the safe clinical use of both instruments for shaping multi-rooted teeth.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of NiTi alloys {{and the development}} of their properties, namely superelasticity, motivated the inclusion of such materials in files used in the clinical practice of Endodontics. These files present several advantages when compared to Stainless Steel files (still widely used today), especially their larger flexibility, whereby the improvement of these alloys {{over the last few years}} has deserved a growing attention by both the medical industry and medical community. Flexibility in endodontic files is paramount for the preparation of anatomically complex root canals, since it preserves the dental structure, limits the apical transport, reduces the risk of iatrogenic mistakes and allows the irrigant to flow and reach the apical foramen. Flexibility in NiTi files due to their superelastic behaviour mainly dependends not only on the crystallographic phases present in the alloy and the thermal, mechanical and chemical treatments to which the alloy has been subjected but also due to files’ geometry. Recently, the market has seen introduced the <b>M-Wire,</b> a NiTi alloy used in GTX files that, according to its manufacturer, has been treated in order to have a larger flexibility at body temperature than files built with conventional NiTi wire, for instance the one used in GT files. This study aims at contributing to the better understanding of the mechanisms behind the properties each kind of file presents and to find out supporting grounds that substantiate the manufacturer pretension, through the metallurgic characterization of GT and GTX files by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and through finite element models of the files under bending. Some experimental results are presented and discussed, being shown that, at body temperature, the GTX files accuse the presence of R Phase, contrary to the GT files, being their geometry very alike; as such, they are expected to be more flexible and clinically superior...|$|E
40|$|Aim To compare static cyclic fatigue {{resistance}} of unused, unused and sterilized and clinically used conventional NiTi GT and <b>M-Wire</b> GTX files. Methodology One {{hundred and sixty}} new files (80 GT and 80 GT series X) were divided into four control groups and four experimental groups (n= 20 each). Control groups were new unused files, and new sterilized files. In the experimental groups instruments were used in 3 (GT 1 and GTX 1 groups) or 4 molars (GT 2 and GTX 2 groups). Cyclic {{fatigue resistance}} was tested in stainless steel curved canals (60 °, r = 3 mm). Each file was rotated until fracture (300 rpm, 2 N·cm torque). Time to fracture (s) was registered. Mean life, eta and beta parameters of their Weibull distributions were calculated. Results Unused and sterilized GTX files will last significantly longer than GT files with a probability of 75 % and 65 % respectively, while mean life was significantly longer for GT than for GTX in used files with a probability of 68 %. Sterilized GT files will last longer than unused files with a probability of 66 %. In both brands, unused and sterilized files will last significantly longer than files used clinically with a probability higher than 98 %. The probability that GT will last longer after being used in three rather than four molars was 62 % (statistically significant), and 52 % (not statistically significant) for GTX. Conclusions GTX files had an extended cyclic fatigue life when compared with GT when they were unused or unused and sterilized, but GT were significantly more resistant to cyclic fatigue after clinical usage than GT series X files 3 mm from the tip. Sterilization of files enhanced the cyclic fatigue resistance of GT instruments. Clinical use of files diminished cyclic fatigue resistance. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to compare the different glide path instruments in order to assess the work time and the number of use for each instrument. Materials and methods: There were used 100 endodontic resin blocks with an S curvature for each group of instruments, on each block, first were used the k file # 10 and then the glide path was done using always the Xsmart machine, setting torque 5. 2  n/cm 2, speed 250  g/m, all instruments were used until their separation and then the results were studied. The time was also counted to obtain the complete pre-flaring for each group. The same test was also repeated on extracted teeth, chosen from mb canal of maxillary molars, and mandibular molars, a total of 50 canals for each group; also in this group the pre-flaring was done counting the number of use for each instrument up to their separation and counting the time to obtain it. Result and conclusions: Pathfiles group tested on resin blocks: pathfile # 13 the result was: 100 out of 100 canals, pathfiles# 16 : 60 out of 100 canals, pathfile # 19 : 42 out of 100 canals. Pathfiles group tested on extracted teeth: pathfile # 13 : 50 out off 50 canals, pathfiles# 16 : 50 out of 50 canals, pathfile # 19 : 50 out of 50 canals, no separated instruments. Proglider group on resin block: single proglider 100 out of 100 blocks. Proglider group on extracted teeth: single proglider 50 out of 50 canals. Time to obtain the pre-flaring with pathfile: 10  s. Time to obtain the pre-flaring with proglider: 8  s. Both files give good results for an effective canal pre-flaring and glide path, making easier the following canal shaping independently of the chosen shaping technique. There are no significant differences in the working time, and the strength of the pathfiles is confirmed for the new <b>M-wire</b> file: proglider...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foi avaliada, a resistencia a fadiga e o comportamento em torcao de instrumentos ProFile GT (Dentsply-Maillefer, Baillagues, Suica) e ProFile GT Series X (GTX) (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Oklahoma, USA). A composicao quimica da liga NiTi foi analisada semi-quantitativamente por espectroscopia de energia de raios-X (EDS), as fases presentes foram identificadas atraves de analises por difratometria de raios-XDRX, as temperaturas de transformacao identificadas por calorimetria exploratoria diferencial (DSC) e o acabamento {{superficial}} foi avaliado por microscopia eletronica de varredura (MEV). A avaliacao dimensional foi realizada atraves de fotografias dos instrumentos pelo software Image-Pro Plus 6. 0. Os instrumentos foram divididos em dois grupos: Grupo experimental de fadiga, com 20 instrumentos novos GT e GTX de calibre 20 e taper. 06 (n= 10) ensaiados ate a ruptura em dispositivo de bancada de fadiga, para determinacao do numero de ciclos ate a fratura (NCF). Grupo experimental de torcao com 20 instrumentos novos GT e GTX de calibre 20 e taper. 04 (n= 10) ensaiados em torcao ate a ruptura, para determinacao dos valores medios de torque maximo e de deflexao angular ate a fratura. Os resultados obtidos foram analisados estatisticamente pelo teste ANOVA (95 % de confiabilidade). Todos os instrumentos apresentaram caracteristicas superficiais satisfatorias. A composicao quimica foi a mesma em todos os instrumentos analisados, aproximadamente 50, 5 %Ni- 49, 5 %Ti atomica. Os difratogramas, de GT e GTX, apresentaram apenas a presenca da austenita (fase À, de estrutura B 2) e as temperaturas de transformacao variaram, sugerindo possiveis diferencas nos tratamentos termicos dos fios. Os instrumentos GTX 20 /. 06 apresentaram resistencia a fadiga significativamente maior, quando comparados aos instrumentos GT 20 /. 06. Os instrumentos GT 20 /. 04 apresentaram valores de torque maximos significativamente maiores que os instrumentos GTX, embora menores valores de deflexao angular ate a fratura. Considerando que os dois instrumentos apresentam geometria e diametros similares, e possivel que o tratamento termico utilizado na liga (<b>M-Wire)</b> tenha influenciado o comportamento mecanico dos instrumentos analisados neste estudo. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the flexural fatigue and torsional resistance of ProFile GT (Dentsply-Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) and ProFile GT Series X (GTX) (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Oklahoma, USA) instruments, taking into account their structural and dimensional characteristics. The instrument diameter at each millimeter from the tip and pitch length were the dimensional parameters measured. Chemical composition was determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and phase constitution by x-ray diffraction. Vickers microhardness measurements were performed to assess instrument strength. One group of 20 /. 06 GT and GTX instruments (n = 10 each) was tested until failure in a flexural fatigue test device, whereas another group of 20 /. 04 files (n = 10 each) was tested in torsion based on ISO 3630 - 1. GT and GTX instruments showed approximately the same chemical composition, namely 51 at%Ni- 49 at%Ti (56 wt%Ni- 44 wt%Ti) and contained mainly the â-phase. GTX instruments showed higher intensity x-ray diffraction peaks and a statistically higher Vickers microhardness. There was a significant decrease in the diameter of GTX in relation to GT instruments from D 6 to D 9 for 20 /. 04 instruments and from D 4 to D 7 for 20 /. 06 instruments. Pitch length increased along the active part of both instruments, with a steeper increase in GTX. In general, GT Series X instruments were significantly more resistant to flexural fatigue than were similar GT instruments (p < 0. 001) but exhibited lower torsional strength (p < 0. 001). Different structural and dimensional characteristics were found in GTX instruments in comparison with GT instruments; this is probably the cause for their higher flexural fatigue resistance and lower torsional strength...|$|E
