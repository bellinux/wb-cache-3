5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} <b>my</b> <b>return.</b> Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E
5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on <b>my</b> <b>return</b> from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E
25|$|After <b>my</b> <b>return</b> from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon <b>my</b> <b>return</b> to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate <b>my</b> <b>return</b> to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|Insistent on the unimportance of {{specifications}} in general, Naim never published {{technical specifications}} for this low-powered design. Trade speculation {{of its power}} output ranged from 5 to 15 watts per channel. Naim confirmed years later that the NAIT is rated at 13 watts. Part of its mystique seemed to stem from its low power: in developing the successor to the NAIT, Naim founder Julian Vereker remarked that R [...] "cooked up a more powerful version and presented it to me on <b>my</b> <b>return</b> [...] it sounded awful." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving <b>my</b> <b>return</b> from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
500|$|According to Dion, the album's title, A New Day Has Come, {{acknowledged}} a {{new chapter}} in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of 11 September and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. [...] "It represents my child, because I gave life," [...] Dion said. [...] "Obviously, it also marks <b>my</b> <b>return</b> with a new album. But a new day has also come in the lives of other people because something bad has happened, because we've lost lives, because there's a scar on our world now." [...] Dion struggled over an appropriate image for the cover of the album, feeling that a portrait reflecting her good fortune was in poor taste. She suggested to Sony Music Entertainment that the album cover not include her picture. However, after much discussion, the photo shoot for A New Day Has Come took place in Montreal in late December 2001 with well-renowned photographer Melvin Sokolsky. On 30 and 31 January 2002 an additional photo session for the album took place in Florida, on a beach near Dion's home by the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier. The album cover for A New Day Has Come by Demarchelier was released on 28 February 2002.|$|E

Oxford won all three matches although Eddy (as he was known) made only 8 runs in total during these matches. Shrimp Leveson Gower records in his Recollections of Oxford cricket an incident forty years later when he had scored 73 runs in Oxford's first innings. 'On <b>my</b> <b>return</b> to the pavilion my Uncle – Edward Chandos Leigh, who was seated near the entrance gate, greeted me with the words: [...] "Well Done, Schwimp (he could not pronounce his R's) [...] "Capital, capital, you played just like I used to".

2500|$|A vision {{given to}} Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, February 16, 1832. Prefacing {{the record of}} this vision, Joseph Smith’s history states: [...] "Upon <b>my</b> <b>return</b> from Amherst conference, I resumed the {{translation}} of the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been received, {{it was apparent that}} many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body the term 'Heaven,' as intended for the Saints' eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, ... while translating St. John's Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision." [...] At the time this vision was given, the Prophet [...] was translating John 5:29.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, [...] "virtually {{every detail}} has {{political}} significance in this allegory." [...] Orwell himself wrote in 1946, [...] "Of course I intended it {{primarily as a}} satire on the Russian revolution.. that kind of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [...] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert." [...] In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, [...] "...for {{the past ten years}} I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On <b>my</b> <b>return</b> from Spain [...] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish they}} had {{mentioned}} what the matter was," [...] said Edgar, with a troubled look, as he and Baldwin descended to the cabin.

2500|$|Christgau {{was born}} in Greenwich Village {{and grew up in}} Queens, the son of a fireman. He has said he became a rock and roll fan when disc jockey Alan Freed moved to the city in 1954. After {{attending}} a public school in New York City, he left New York for four years to attend Dartmouth College, graduating in 1962 with a B.A. in English. While at college his musical interests turned to jazz, but he quickly returned to rock after moving back to New York. Christgau has said that Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches of Spain initiated in him [...] "one phase of the disillusionment with jazz that resulted in <b>my</b> <b>return</b> to rock and roll". He was deeply influenced by New Journalism writers such as Gay Talese and Tom Wolfe. [...] "My ambitions when I went into journalism were always, to an extent, literary", Christgau later said.|$|E

He began coughing and spitting blood. I showed him the blood. He remarked {{that he had a}} burning sensation around his lungs. He tried to undress but was unable. I convinced him to see a doctor, he accepted. Then Édouard added ‘I will die, it’s so sad to die so young and so far away from dear parents.’ He asked for a glass of water. I ran to get water and at <b>my</b> <b>return</b> he was already unconscious. The ambulance transported him to the Emergency Hospital where he died a few minutes later.” Édouard Beaupré died on July 3, 1904 from a pulmonary hemorrhage at age 23. Airne Benard, who acted as Édouard’s agent, had the body embalmed. Even {{at the time of his}} death, doctors determined that Beaupré was still growing.|$|E

[...] Ricky was not killed-off in the serial, as the producers opted to give the actor an open-ended storyline, enabling him to return. An EastEnders spokesperson claimed that [...] "Owen's decision to take a break from filming had been reached in mutual agreement with EastEnders bosses". Owen stated, [...] "I love playing Ricky Butcher but it will be good to take off his overalls for a while. After 12 years, two failed marriages and two children, I'm looking forward to some time off - but also <b>my</b> <b>return</b> to Walford." [...] Executive producer at the time, Matthew Robinson, said, [...] "Viewers have come to love the character of Ricky Butcher due to Sid's wonderful acting. We wish Sid luck in any forthcoming projects and look forward to welcoming Ricky back to EastEnders in due course." ...|$|E
