5|$|On 15 December 1934 {{the corps}} had 525 tanks, including: 159 BT tanks, 181 T-26s, 57 T-37/41, and 6 Vickers Medium Mark II tanks. The {{remainder}} were command or flamethrower tanks. On 1 January 1936 the corps had 436 tanks. Around this time, Kombrig Alexander Grechanik became the corps commander. In June 1937, Komdiv Mikhail Petrovich Petrov became corps commander. In September 1937 the 13th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade {{was transferred to}} the 11th <b>Mechanised</b> Corps in the Transbaikal Military District and renamed the 32nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade. In October, a new 13th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade was formed in Kaluga. On 7 May 1938, the corps' Separate Tank Battalion became the Moscow Military District's 4th Light Tank Regiment. In August 1938, the corps was converted into the 15th Tank Corps when the Red Army reorganized its mechanized forces to make them more tank-heavy.|$|E
5|$|Armed clashes {{in eastern}} Slavonia {{gradually}} intensified as the JNA committed significant new units to the Battle of Vukovar, including the 453rd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade, the 1st Proletarian Guards <b>Mechanised</b> Division, and the 252nd Armoured Brigade. During the initial {{stage of the}} battle, the JNA bypassed a number of Croat villages southeast {{of the city of}} Vukovar—including Lovas. In late September 1991, the easternmost Croatian positions in the area ran along a line connecting the villages of Nijemci–Ilača–Lovas and those were defended by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 109th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the RLF reached {{a level of}} 12 rifle, one <b>mechanised,</b> and one tank division. Between 1960 and 1964 the rifle and <b>mechanised</b> {{divisions}} were converted to motor rifle divisions, and reductions in strength began; force size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions by 1970. From 1970 to 1976, three more motor rifle divisions were formed, but one was deactivated in 1977, and the eight motor rifle and three tank division figure remained that way {{for the rest of}} the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|The {{quarrying}} at Woolsthorpe {{was done}} by hand {{with the help of}} explosives until 1917 when a steam shovel was introduced to <b>mechanise</b> part of the work.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 McNaughton {{joined the}} regular army and in 1922 was {{promoted}} to Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Chief of the General Staff in 1929. During that time he worked at <b>mechanising</b> the army and modernising the militia.|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} did not <b>mechanise</b> {{before the}} outbreak of the Second World War; on mobilisation, it was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, and moved in 1940 to the Middle East, where it saw service in Iraq and Syria in 1941.|$|R
5|$|Since 1988, the JNA's Bjelovar {{garrison}} {{had been}} included in the 32nd Corps, which was headquartered in Varaždin, and was the second largest JNA corps in Croatia. It commanded the 32nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade and the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment both based in Varaždin, the 32nd Engineer Regiment in Čakovec, the 411th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment based in Križevci, the 73rd Motorised Brigade headquartered in Koprivnica, the 265th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade based in Bjelovar, and the 288th Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade in Virovitica. The JNA did not have sufficient troops in the area to secure all its facilities, but it was possible that the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps units deployed to Okučani might attempt to relieve some of the garrisons. A part of the 265th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade was deployed to Koprivnica to reinforce the 73rd Motorised Brigade. It consisted of a battalion of tanks and one engineer battalion, and they were relocated to Koprivnica in August 1990 to boost the JNA's presence in the town. A battlegroup comprising 23 armoured and 14 other vehicles, drawn from the 265th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade and commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Milan Čeleketić, was deployed to Okučani. It was attached to the 5th Corps on 15 August to prevent Croatian special police from ousting Croatian Serb forces from the town.|$|E
5|$|The 5th <b>Mechanised</b> Corps was a <b>mechanised</b> {{corps of}} the Red Army, formed on three occasions. It was first formed in 1934 and was {{converted}} into the 15th Tank Corps in 1938. It was reformed in the Far East in 1940 and moved west before the German {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union. It fought in the First Battle of Smolensk, losing large numbers of tanks in the Lepel counterattack. The corps was encircled in the Smolensk pocket and after breaking out was disbanded in late August 1941. Its third formation, from elements of the 22nd Tank Corps, occurred in September 1942. The corps fought in: Operation Little Saturn, Operation Gallop, the Second Battle of Smolensk, the Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive, and the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive. In September 1944, it became the 9th Guards <b>Mechanised</b> Corps.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{different}} approaches to <b>mechanising</b> typesetting were independently developed in the late 19th century. One, known as the Monotype composition caster system, produced texts {{with the aid of}} perforated paper-ribbons, all characters are cast separate.

5|$|The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences {{immediately}} west of {{the city}} of Sisak and north of Glina were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigades. On the opposite bank, the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west. The planned main axis of the Operation Whirlwind extended across the 592nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade AOR, commanded by Colonel Boško Džombić.|$|E
5|$|The JNA units near Osijek were {{subordinated to}} the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, {{commanded}} by Major General Andrija Biorčević. In the city itself, the JNA had several barracks which housed the 12th Proletarian <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade and the 12th Mixed Artillery Regiment. The 12th Proletarian <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade contained {{one of a}} handful battalions maintained by the JNA at full combat readiness. Osijek was established as their starting point in a planned westward offensive toward Našice and Bjelovar.|$|E

50|$|After the First World War, {{the leading}} British banks entered an {{agreement}} with the government that they would not attempt further amalgamations without Treasury approval. As a result, Midland turned its attention to expanding its branch network, adding new banking services, <b>mechanising</b> its systems (from 1928) and advertising its activities.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{was also}} {{concerned}} with technical developments within mines.

40|$|We <b>mechanise</b> {{the logic}} TLA ∗ [8], an {{extension}} of Lamport’s Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) [5] for specifying and reasoning about concurrent and reactive systems. Aiming at a framework for <b>mechanising</b> the verification of TLA (or TLA ∗) specifications, this contribution reuses some elements from a previous axiomatic encoding of TLA in Isabelle/HOL by the second author [7], which {{has been part of}} the Isabelle distribution. In contrast to that previous work, we give here a shallow, definitional embedding, with the following highlights: • a theory of infinite sequences, including a formalisation of the concepts of stuttering invariance central to TLA and TLA*; • a definition of the semantics of TLA*, which extends TLA by a mutually-recursive definition of formulas and pre-formulas, generalising TLA action formulas; • a substantial set of derived proof rules, including the TLA * axiom...|$|R
5|$|Swedish analysts Carolina Vendil Pallin and Fredrik Westerlund {{said that}} {{although}} the Russian Black Sea Fleet did not meet significant resistance, it proved effective at implementing elaborate manoeuvres. <b>Mechanised</b> infantry opened a second front in Abkhazia, which contributed to the rapidity of the Russian military victory.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:50 and 17:07, {{there was}} an {{exchange}} of small arms fire between the JNA troops in the Corps headquarters and a nearby police checkpoint, and at 17:35 a mortar attack was launched by the 32nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade. The mortar fire targeted the police station and surrounding buildings, and an electrical substation in the nearby village of Nedeljanec. The civilian authorities in Varaždin promptly notified the European Community Monitoring Mission of damage to the city. By 16 September, the JNA artillery bombardment of the city had extended to various street intersections and approaches to the Drava bridge on the Varaždin–Čakovec road. The latter was counter-battery fire, targeting ZNG mortars which fired approximately 150 bombs against the JNA during the entire operation. By the end of 16 September, 42 JNA officers and soldiers had deserted from the 32nd <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade. The JNA ordered its border guards posted along the Hungarian border from Čakovec to Ludbreg to lay land mines around their facilities, then cross into Hungary and surrender to that country's authorities.|$|E
5|$|By 22 September, Croatian {{forces had}} besieged and {{captured}} all major garrisons of the 32nd Corps, except those in Bjelovar and Koprivnica. The JNA garrisons {{in those two}} cities were ordered to extract themselves to territory near Okučani that was {{under the control of}} the 5th Corps. The Koprivnica-based garrison was ordered to break out to Bjelovar, link up with the 265th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade, then proceed towards Daruvar via Grubišno Polje. At the same time, the Bjelovar garrison had been blockaded, and its utilities and supplies were cut. Negotiations ensued for the surrender of the garrison, led by the civilian crisis headquarters presided over by Jure Šimić. The negotiations stalled when the JNA demanded that the 265th <b>Mechanised</b> Brigade be allowed to evacuate to Okučani or Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the time, a number of Croatian Serb civilians took refuge in the barracks either fearing for their safety or in order to isolate themselves from the Croatian authorities.|$|E

40|$|Lenses {{provide an}} {{abstract}} interface for manipulating data types through spatially separated views. They are defined abstractly {{in terms of}} two functions, get, the return a value from the source type, and put that updates the value. We <b>mechanise</b> the underlying theory of lenses, {{in terms of an}} algebraic hierarchy of lenses, including well-behaved and very well-behaved lenses, each lens class being characterised by a set of lens laws. We also <b>mechanise</b> a lens algebra in Isabelle that enables their composition and comparison, so as to allow construction of complex lenses. This is accompanied by a large library of algebraic laws. Moreover we also show how the lens classes can be applied by instantiating them with a number of Isabelle data types. This theory development is based on our recent paper, which shows how lenses can be used to unify heterogeneous representations of state-spaces in formalised programs...|$|R
