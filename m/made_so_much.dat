It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
25|$|In May 1859, Colonel Wright made a {{scouting}} trip fifty {{miles up the}} Snake River, which joins the Columbia not far {{to the north of}} Wallula. Colonel Wright was the first steamboat to reach Lewiston, Idaho, 140 miles upriver from Wallula. In 1861 she ascended the Clearwater River to within two miles of the forks, accomplishing the downstream run of over 300 miles to Wallula in less than 24 hours. Thompson and Coe <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money with the Wright that in the spring of 1860 they built a larger and more powerful steamer, the Tenino on the same route, afterward pooling both steamers with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company.|$|E
25|$|Adding to his {{reputation}} {{was the fact}} that Liszt gave away much of his proceeds to charity and humanitarian causes. In fact, Liszt had <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money by his mid-forties that virtually all his performing fees after 1857 went to charity. While his work for the Beethoven monument and the Hungarian National School of Music are well known, he also gave generously to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, the establishment of a Gymnasium at Dortmund, and the construction of the Leopold Church in Pest. There were also private donations to hospitals, schools and charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. When he found out about the Great Fire of Hamburg, which raged for three days during May 1842 and destroyed much of the city, he gave concerts in aid of the thousands of homeless there.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} hours after Fiona enacted her curse {{on the entire}} town that engulfed {{everyone}} after the wedding. However, Henry, who is spared, thanks to being the Author and having the Heart of the Truest Believer, wakes up with the Storybook in his hands, and starts searching for his family. After running into Archie, he tells Henry that Emma is at the hospital, where she has been committed to a psychiatric ward {{for the past two}} years. While visiting Emma, he learns that with Fiona's Curse, Regina's original curse was never broken, and Emma had stopped believing him. He asks her where Snow, Hook and David are, but the new Curse now has Emma believing that these events never happened, citing that she has <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> progress and can’t go back, then tells Henry to stop telling her about these stories. Suddenly Fiona (who is now the Mayor and Henry's mother) arrives and takes the book from Henry, but before he leaves he whispers in Emma's ear to tell her to resist, as the Final Battle is coming.|$|E

500|$|By May 1972, Bushnell and Dabney quit Nutting Associates {{and moved}} to {{incorporate}} Syzygy Engineering; they instead named it Atari due to another company with a similar name. Bushnell later stated that he was encouraged {{by the success of}} Computer Space in regards to future game ideas, as he had never before created something that <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money, and additionally felt that his time at Nutting gave him confidence in running his own company because he [...] "couldn't screw it up more than they did". Nutting Associates did not make any further Computer Space games before closing in 1976. Bushnell's enthusiasm was soon substantiated, as Atari's first game, Pong, went on to substantially greater success than Computer Space. Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release {{marked the beginning of the}} commercial video game industry.|$|E

500|$|In 1863 James {{encouraged}} him to further his education at a classical school in New Market, since Johnson had completed the coursework at the Franklin common school. The New Market school was taught by Joseph Salyards (or Saliards), a professor and writer described as one of [...] "the most learned men of the age" [...] and [...] "a most remarkable scholar in many respects." [...] Johnson was accompanied to New Market by {{a young man with}} the surname of Clark, who read him his lessons; he tutored Clark in several subjects, including French. At New Market, Johnson <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> progress in mathematics, literature, science and foreign languages with his sighted classmates that he returned to Franklin after two years. In 1866 the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind in Staunton offered him the opportunity to advance his professional studies in education, and he completed one term in 1867.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was parodied during the 2003 French & Sanders Christmas Special episode of American comedy show MADtv. [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was sampled by Justice on their tracks [...] "D.A.N.C.E." [...] and [...] "Valentine", from their debut album † (2007). The music video was recreated on the 2010 American series Glee episode [...] "Britney/Brittany". The {{characters}} of Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) are put under general anesthesia {{during a trip}} to the dentist's office. They share an hallucination, in which Morris appears as Spears, whereas Rivera plays Madonna. Morris explained, [...] "The 'Me Against the Music' montage, it's literally copied exactly from the video, the shots and looks, but the choreography is <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more for a dancer– none of it is from the video. [...] It's insane." [...] At the end of the number, Spears replaces Santana and pins Brittany against the wall, announcing to her that she is in a fantasy. Spears applauded the cover, pointing out that it [...] "looks just like the original," [...] and adding, [...] "Santana does a great Madonna impression." [...] The song charted at number ninety-three in Australia, fifty-four in Canada and fifty-six in the United States.|$|E
500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga. In January 2011, Clemons was putting together an exercise machine in his Florida house {{when his wife}} told him that Gaga's representatives were on the phone, and {{they wanted him to}} play on her upcoming album. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. I would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in Punch and on stage, was satire of the {{aesthetic}} movement. His play The Colonel (1881), based on The Serious Family, a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce {{that he was able}} to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed The Colonel into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, Patience, but Patience ran even longer than The Colonel. Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing Patience: [...] "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of The Colonel". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of The Tempest entitled Ariel in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. The Times complained of the [...] "flatness and insipidity" [...] of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original. The Observer was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the 1890 bridge led to {{extensive}} {{new development}} {{east of the}} river. As the bridge was being built in 1889, a consortium known as the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate purchased [...] {{of land in the}} former East Washington Heights development. They built a number of roads in the area, and landscaped the plots along Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Alabama Avenue SE, and Branch Avenue SE with gardens, orchards, pavilions, and shade trees. [...] In 1903, Colonel Arthur E. Randle formed the United States Realty Company, bought out the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate properties, and founded the settlement of Randle Highlands. In 1902, Randle won approval from Congress to lay streetcar tracks across the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. By 1905, he had extended his line [...] down Pennsylvania Avenue SE into the new Randle Highlands. The streetcar line over the bridge spurred extensive new development east of the river. Randle began selling lots in Randle Highlands at a brisk pace in 1903.

2500|$|Having {{never before}} worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup [...] "rather daunting" [...] and {{described}} the three to four hour application process {{before moving on to}} costuming. [...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible.

[...] When she came back to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that <b>made</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting.
