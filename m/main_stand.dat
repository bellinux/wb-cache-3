5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand.</b> The Anfield Road end and Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> a three-tiered. Entry {{to the stadium}} is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013/14 season, the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was re-opened to seat {{the high}} number of away {{supporters}}. In one instance, the North Stand was used for Celtic supporters as fears grew over fire dangers. During early June 2016 the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was renamed The Colin Weir Stand in honour of Colin Weir who was made the first ever patron of Partick Thistle after making numerous donations to the club's youth team The Thistle Weir Academy.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, various {{upgrades}} {{and repairs}} {{have been made}} to the stadium. By 1968, the old wooden <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was in poor condition and in need of replacement. At a cost of £80,000, today's <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was erected and opened by Minister for Sport and former referee Denis Howell. In 1979, the terracing on the Cowshed and Paddock was concreted. The Tranmere suite was added to the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> in 1988, with further bars and executive suites added soon after.|$|E

The 40-year-old structure is becoming increasingly expensive to repair.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> is {{the oldest}} in Prenton Park, having been opened in December 1968. It is also the largest, with a {{capacity}} of 5,957. A two tier stand, it is generally divided into three main sections. The lower tier consists of the Bebington End paddock (capacity 1,150) and the Town End paddock (capacity 1,209), {{either side of the}} halfway line. The upper tier is simply referred to as the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> (capacity 3,598).|$|E

5|$|The <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E

40|$|Widodo, Sutarno, Widoretno S, Sugiyarto (2010) Taxonomic {{diversity}} of macroflora vegetation among <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> {{of the forest}} of Wanagama I, Gunung Kidul. Biodiversitas 11 : 89 - 92. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the {{diversity of}} taxonomy of macro flora vegetation in the <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> of the forest of Wanagama I in Gunung Kidul. Vegetation diversity data can be used as a recommendation for conserving the local biodiversity as well as other planned conservation activities. The nested square sampling method was applied to collect the data required in the research. The size of the nested square was based on species-area curves, as well as theories of other studies. The seven <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> studied were: pine (Pinus merkusii), mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), kesambi (Schcleicera oleosa), teak (Tectona grandis), cajuput (Melaleuca leucodendron), Glerecidae (Glyricidia sepium), and a mixed stand. Each stand was observed four times. The square location was randomly determined based on a contour map of the area. The variables of the study of diversity in terms of taxonomy consist of species, genus, family, and order richness. The results were, then, analyzed statistically using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Turkey’s test. The result of the study shows that the species of the <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> was affected very significantly by the diversity of all level: species, genus, family, and order total richness.

5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> used a propped {{cantilever roof}} design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' {{view of the}} pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> roofs had {{been put on the}} Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{consists}} of four stands: the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> which also houses the club offices and players facilities; the Merkland Road Family Stand; the South Stand, which is opposite the <b>main</b> <b>stand</b> and holds the largest amount of spectators; and the Richard Donald stand to the east, which was completed in 1993, contains hospitality suites, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. A quarter of the South Stand is used to accommodate travelling supporters. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.|$|E
50|$|The club {{is based}} at The Magpies stadium in Oldends Lane, GL10 2DG. The current ground has a {{capacity}} of 3300, and the club is actively looking for sponsors for {{either of the two}} <b>main</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{underwent}} major renovations and expansions in 2010. The playing {{surface was}} replaced {{in its entirety}} and covered stands were built {{on the opposite side}} of the <b>main</b> <b>stands,</b> increasing the stadium's capacity to 7,814 seats.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 February 2017, the {{construction}} of the <b>main</b> <b>stand's</b> roof started and an enigmatic message was made clear on one of the snow-covered ramps saying [...] "ETO" [...] referring to Győri ETO FC, the archrival of Szombathelyi Haladás.|$|R
5|$|There are 59spaces {{available}} in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces {{are located in the}} <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand,</b> with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E
5|$|After Bradford City won the Division Two {{championship}} in 1907–08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme {{of the ground}} {{to prepare for the}} club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock—a standing area in front of the 5,300-seater <b>main</b> <b>stand</b> which was built in 1908—and build a Spion Kop at {{the north side of the}} ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the <b>main</b> <b>stand.</b> Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the <b>main</b> <b>stand</b> side of the ground. The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908–09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The stadium's working name, {{subject to}} change with future {{sponsorship}} agreements, was changed from [...] "Arena92" [...] to [...] "U Arena", referencing {{the configuration of the}} <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> and the structure's shape when viewed from the air, in November 2016.|$|R
50|$|The new Burke-Tarr Stadium {{was erected}} within {{nine months of}} the original's demolition, and was {{dedicated}} on October 22, 2005 during Homecoming festivities as the Eagles defeated Lenoir-Rhyne, 33 - 6. The facility's <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> consist primarily of steel and aluminum, as concrete prices {{at the time of}} construction made it impossible to afford a concrete structure. The metal design allowed for four additional entrances to the <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> via stairwells from the ground level, in addition to the entrances on either end of the stadium. The stands contain press box supported by two steel and brick columns, leaving a great deal of space underneath for concessions stands, merchandise booths, and restroom facilities.|$|R
50|$|Bull is {{regarded}} as a legend at Wolves and one of the <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> at their home ground, Molineux, is named after him. This commemoration was made in June 2003, with the stand having previously being known as the John Ireland Stand.|$|R
5|$|Construction for an {{extension}} to the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, {{making it one}} of the largest all-seater single stands in European football. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 59,000.|$|E
5|$|David Murray {{acquired}} {{control of}} Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} of adding a third tier to the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand.</b> This was a highly complex process, as the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{play at the}} 4,400 {{capacity}} Broadhurst Park, {{which opened}} in May 2015. The ground was built {{at a cost of}} £6.3 million, using £2 million from a Community Share Scheme and the remainder from a variety of governmental and charity grants. The ground is surrounded on all sides by covered stands: the St. Mary's Road End (east), the North Stand, the Lightbowne Road End (west) and the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> (south), the latter of which has seating sections. Within the <b>Main</b> <b>Stand</b> is a clubhouse with a bar and catering facilities, club offices, changing rooms, a medical suite and a classroom. The stadium is shared with a local junior team, Moston Juniors F.C.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{directly}} adjacent to an intercity bus terminal. Not only {{it is one}} of few Prague Metro subway stations that is not located underground, its vestibule is located even higher than the <b>main</b> <b>stands</b> and roads of the bus terminal.|$|R
50|$|Brunton Park {{is split}} into four {{separate}} stands; Warwick Road End, East <b>Stand,</b> <b>Main</b> (West) <b>Stand</b> and the Petteril End, which remains closed unless exceptionally large crowds are in attendance.|$|R
25|$|A unique terraced-earthworks {{parking lot}} was built behind the <b>main</b> <b>stands,</b> {{allowing}} ticketholders to park at roughly {{the level of their}} seats, minimizing use of ramps once inside. The stadium was also designed to be earthquake-resistant, an important consideration in California, and it has withstood several serious earthquakes.|$|R
