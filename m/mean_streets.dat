5|$|After the {{financial}} backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following {{the release of}} Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot {{was influenced by the}} films Le Samouraï, <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets,</b> and Narazumono. Woo desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.|$|E

25|$|Championed by {{influential}} {{film critic}} Pauline Kael, <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets</b> was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though {{the majority of}} <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets</b> was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller and early Jean-Luc Godard.|$|E

Also, often {{contributes}} {{his voice to}} a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). He provides the opening voice-over narration in <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets</b> and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull; provides {{the voice of the}} unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead.|$|E
25|$|I Vitelloni {{inspired}} European directors Juan Antonio Bardem, Marco Ferreri, and Lina Wertmüller and had {{an influence}} on Martin Scorsese's <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets</b> (1973), George Lucas's American Graffiti (1974), Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire (1985), and Barry Levinson's Diner (1987), among many others. When the American magazine Cinema asked Stanley Kubrick in 1963 to name his favorite films, the film director listed I Vitelloni as number one in his Top 10 list.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at My Door with his fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets.</b>|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{his films}} have {{featured}} corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator.

He has been noted for his liberal usage of profanity and violence.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Scorsese {{made the}} Depression-era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie {{producer}} Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot {{with very little}} money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets.</b> Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films {{that he wanted to}} make, rather than someone else's projects.|$|E
25|$|The young Rasofsky {{grew up on}} Chicago's <b>mean</b> <b>streets,</b> {{ultimately}} {{ignoring his}} father's desire for {{him to become a}} rabbi and his admonition that Jews do not resort to violence. Let the goyim be the fighters, Ross later recalled being told by his father. The trumbeniks, the murderers—we are the scholars. Ross's ambition in life was to become a Jewish teacher and a Talmudic scholar, but his life was changed forever when his father was shot dead resisting a robbery at his small grocery. Prostrate from grief, his mother Sarah suffered a nervous breakdown and his younger siblings—Ida, Sam and George—were placed in an orphanage or farmed out to other members of the extended family. Dov was left to his own devices at the age of 14.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{screenplay}} for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets),</b> the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who {{went on to}} co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro. The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the No. 1 American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked Raging Bull as the 24th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked Raging Bull as the 4th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Scorsese {{was listed}} among Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World. In August 2007, Scorsese {{was named the}} second-greatest {{director}} of all time in a poll by Total Film magazine, in front of Steven Spielberg and behind Alfred Hitchcock. In 2007, Scorsese was honored by the National Italian American Foundation (N.I.A.F.) at the nonprofit's thirty-second Anniversary Gala. During the ceremony, Scorsese helped launch N.I.A.F.'s Jack Valenti Institute, which provides support to Italian film students in the U.S., in memory of former foundation board member and {{past president of the}} Motion Picture Association of America (M.P.A.A.) Jack Valenti. Scorsese received his award from Mary Margaret Valenti, Valenti's widow.

500|$|Critics have {{observed}} parallels between Reservoir Dogs and other films. For its nonlinear storyline, Reservoir Dogs {{has often been}} compared to Rashomon. Critic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in Psycho and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between Reservoir Dogs and Glengarry Glen Ross. [...] Todd McCarthy, who called the film [...] "undeniably impressive", was {{of the opinion that}} it was influenced by <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets,</b> Goodfellas and The Killing. After this film, Tarantino himself was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Gareth K. Vile of The Skinny {{gave the}} book {{three out of}} five stars, and commented, [...] "By {{transplanting}} his thuggish noir from Manchester to LA, Ray Banks' second Cal Innes novel has two sets of <b>mean</b> <b>streets</b> to pace. Not that his grasp of characterisation has gotten any stronger: Donkey Punch is as terse and macho as Saturday's Child, although his hardboiled writing style has become more poised and confident." [...] Andrea Mullaney reviewed the book for Scotland on Sunday and wrote, [...] "Vivid and realistic, with an appealingly flawed hero and an interesting setting amid the underside of modern LA, this is a knockout." ...|$|E

Ah Jong is later found in the church again getting several slugs pulled out of his back showing his intense pain while the altar and cross are shown prominently behind him.

500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson.

[...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you think that is racist, then spend some time on the <b>mean</b> <b>streets</b> of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{frequently}} cited comparison {{has been to}} Tarantino's second and more successful film Pulp Fiction, especially since the majority of audiences saw Reservoir Dogs after the success of Pulp Fiction. Comparisons have been made regarding the black humor in both the films, the theme of accidents, and more concretely, the style of dialogue and narrative style that Tarantino incorporates into both films. [...] Specifically the relationship between whites and blacks plays {{a big part in}} the filmsthough underplayed in Reservoir Dogs. Stanley Crouch of The New York Times compared the way the white criminals speak of black people in Reservoir Dogs to the way they are spoken of in Scorsese's <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets</b> and Goodfellas. Crouch observed the way black people are looked down upon in Reservoir Dogs, but also the way that the criminals accuse each other of [...] "verbally imitating" [...] black men and the characters' apparent sexual attraction to black actress Pam Grier.|$|E
500|$|Hey Good Lookin {{opened in}} New York City on October 1, 1982, and was {{released}} in Los Angeles in January 1983. The film's release was limited, and went largely unnoticed in the United States, although it garnered respectable business in foreign markets. In a brief review, Vincent Canby wrote that it was [...] "not exactly incoherent, but whatever it originally had on its mind seems to have slipped away". Animation historian Jerry Beck wrote, [...] "the beginning {{of the film is}} quite promising, with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage. This is an example of what Bakshi did best—using the medium of animation to comment on society. Unfortunately, he doesn't do it enough in this film. There is a wildly imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax, when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree. This scene almost justifies the whole film. But otherwise, this is a rehash of ideas better explored in Coonskin, Heavy Traffic, and Fritz the Cat." [...] The film has since gained a cult following through cable television and home video. Quentin Tarantino stated that he preferred Hey Good Lookin to Martin Scorsese's <b>Mean</b> <b>Streets.</b>|$|E
