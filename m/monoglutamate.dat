50|$|Folate receptors bind folate {{and reduced}} folic acid {{derivatives}} and mediates delivery of tetrahydrofolate {{to the interior}} of cells. It is then converted from <b>monoglutamate</b> to polyglutamate forms - such as 5- methyltetrahydrofolate - as only <b>monoglutamate</b> forms can be transported across cell membranes. Polyglutamate forms are biologically active enzymatic cofactors required for many folate-dependent processes such as folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism.

Cancer cells require high concentrations of purines to facilitate division [...] and tend to rely on de novo synthesis rather than the nucleotide salvage pathway. Several folate based inhibitors {{have been developed to}} inhibit formylation reactions by GAR transformylase and AICAR transformylase. The first GAR transformylase inhibitor Lometrexol (6R)5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate was developed in the 1980s through a collaboration between Eli Lilly and academic laboratories.Although similar in structure to N10-formyl-THF, lometrexol is incapable of carrying out one carbon transfer reactions. Additionally, several GAR based inhibitors of GAR transformylase have also been synthesized.Development of folate based inhibitors {{have been found to be}} particularly challenging as the inhibitors also down regulate the enzyme folypolyglutamate synthase, which adds additional γ-glutamates to <b>monoglutamate</b> folates and antifolates after entering the cell for increased enzyme affinity. This increased affinity can lead to antifolate resistance.|$|E
40|$|Dietary folate {{consists}} of <b>monoglutamate</b> and polyglutamate folate species. In the small intestine, folate polyglutamate is deconjugated to the <b>monoglutamate</b> form before absorption takes place. This enzymatic deconjugation might limit the bioavailability of polyglutamate folate. Until now, no data {{have been available}} on dietary intake of both folate forms and their associations with folate status. Therefore, we estimated the intake of <b>monoglutamate</b> and polyglutamate folate in the Dutch population and studied whether the association with plasma folate is different for these two folate forms. Dietary intake of <b>monoglutamate</b> and polyglutamate folate from nonfortified foods was estimated for 2435 subjects (1275 men; 1160 women) aged 20 – 65 y. The intake of <b>monoglutamate</b> folate was about one third of total folate intake, derived mainly from bread (20 %) and meat (18 %), whereas two thirds consisted of polyglutamates, derived mainly from vegetables (25 %). The predictive power of the regression model with total folate intake as the independent variable adjusted for age, smoking and alcohol intake, did not increase when including the ratio of <b>monoglutamate</b> to polyglutamate folate intake. In addition, linear regression models showed that both <b>monoglutamate</b> and polyglutamate folate intake were associated positively with plasma folate levels. However, in men, the <b>monoglutamate</b> folate form {{appeared to be a}} threefold stronger determinant of plasma folate levels than polyglutamate folate, whereas in women, both folate forms were equally strong determinants. This might be explained by different food intake patterns of men and women, including alcohol intake. At present, it does not seem necessary to distinguish between food folate forms in advising an increase in folate intake from nonfortified foods...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that phenytoin causes a reduction in folic acid levels, predisposing patients to megaloblastic anemia. Folate is presented in foods as polyglutamate, which is then converted into <b>monoglutamates</b> by intestinal conjugase.

40|$|In plant matrices, folates exist {{largely as}} folylpoly-gamma-glutamates {{requiring}} deglutamylation to <b>monoglutamates</b> prior to absorption, which might impair dietary folate bioavailability. This study investigated folylpoly-gamma-glutamate stability and conversions in broccoli tissue during thermal (25 - 90 degrees C, 30 min) and high-pressure treatments (0. 1 - 600 MPa, 25 - 45 degrees C, 30 min) after vacuum packaging. Folates were analyzed based on poly-gamma-glutamate side chain length by RP-HPLC. During thermal treatments, folates were stable up to 90 degrees C, whereas differences in folyl poly-gamma-glutamate profiles towards higher conjugated folylpoly-gamma-glutamates were observed at elevated temperatures (70 - 90 degrees C). High-pressure treatments resulted in significant folate losses (48 - 78 %). Depending on the pressure-temperature combinations studied, folylpoly-gamma-glutamates {{were converted to}} fiolylmono- and folyldi-gamma-glutamates, which was shown to occur mainly during {{the initial stages of}} the high-pressure treatments, i. e. during pressure build-up and subsequent equilibration. Targeted application of high-pressure treatments can hence be applied to obtain broccoli with higher <b>monoglutamates</b> folate content. Implications towards folate bioavailability in relation to the observed folate degradation, however, requires further investigation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{literature}} review presented {{the effects of}} the polyglutamate chain on the biological and nutritional properties of folates and the main methods used for folate assays, with a special emphasis on the approaches to studying intact polyglutamates. A brief introduction regarding safety aspects of folate fortification was also given. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a UPLC-FLR/PDA method for simultaneous determination of polyglutamyl folate vitamers. Chromatographic conditions were optimised for the resolution of polyglutamyl 5 -methyltetrahydrofolates and major naturally-occurring <b>monoglutamates.</b> Method validation was conducted for both the UPLC method and affinity chromatography. Applicability of the validated method was evaluated on lupin flour, faba bean flour, and dry yeast, which were subjected to preparatory treatments with and without deconjugation. In addition, {{the effects of the}} sequential modification of preparatory treatments on the folate content and composition were investigated by using both the UPLC method and Lactobacillus rhamnosus assay. A desirable separation of target polyglutamates and <b>monoglutamates</b> was successfully achieved on the BEH C 18 UPLC column within 11 minutes. The optimised UPLC method showed satisfactory selectivity, linearity, and sensitivity for the determination of methylated polyglutamates in the femtomole range and <b>monoglutamates</b> in the picogram range. Affinity chromatography showed satisfactory recoveries for polyglutamyl 5 -methyltetrahydrofolates, but not for 5 -formyl polyglutamates. In all three selected foods, 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate was the dominant folate vitamer. Meanwhile, the analysis of undeconjugated samples showed that in the intact methylated folate pools, pentaglutamate predominated in legume flours and heptaglutamate in dry yeast. In addition, different sequences of enzyme and purification pretreatments were found to significantly affect both the total measurable folates and the folate profiles. Our standard preparatory procedures comprising simultaneous treatments with amylase and conjugase, then protease and affinity purification resulted in the greatest yield of total folates, but UPLC analysis indicated incomplete deconjugation. However, a modification in which deconjugation was conducted as the last step enhanced hydrolysis efficiency...|$|R

Treatments included freezing (- 18 C, 16 h) and thawing (4 C, 24 h) and hydrostatic high-pressure treatment (200 MPa, 5 min). Both freezing/thawing and high-pressure treatment increased the proportion of folate in the <b>monoglutamate</b> form in leeks, cauliflower, and green beans 2 - 3 -fold. However, loss of total folate after these treatments was > 55 ÐIt is concluded that conversion of folate polyglutamate to the <b>monoglutamate</b> form in vegetables is possible by certain processing treatments.

40|$|The true {{intracellular}} substrates for folate-dependent enzymes are folylpolyglutamates. We {{have used}} {{measurements of the}} Ki values of folylpolyglutamate dead end inhibitors to assess the relative affinities of folate-dependent enzymes for folate derivatives of different polyglutamate chain lengths. Studies of four enzymes from pig liver, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase, have indicated that folylpolyglutamate inhibitors are bound 3 - 500 fold more tightly than the corresponding monoglutamates. The individual enzymes differ in their selectivity for polyglutamate vs. <b>monoglutamate</b> inhibitors, and in the chain length associated with the greatest affinity of enzyme for inhibitor. We have also examined the effect of polyglutamate chain length on the catalytic parameters associated with folate substrates. Two enzymes, methylenetetra-hydrofolate reductase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, show decreases in Km values for folypolyglutamate substrates. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase shows no detectable differences in the catalytic parameters of polyglutamate vs. <b>monoglutamate</b> substrates and {{no change in the}} order of substrate addition or product release. Thymidylate synthase shows small effects of Km and Vmax values, but the order of addition of substrates and of release of products is reversed with polyglutamate as compared with <b>monoglutamate</b> substrates. Our studies with thymidylate synthase from L. casei have shown that the bacterial enzyme also exhibits a greatly increased affinity for polyglutamate vs. <b>monoglutamate</b> derivatives of folic acid, and that reversal in the order of substrate addition and product release also occurs with polyglutamate as compared with <b>monoglutamate</b> substrates. We have also studied the polyglutamate specificity of methionine synthase, which is responsible for the conversion of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 into H 4 PteGlu 1. This reaction is required for the incorporation of plasma folate into the cellular folate pool, because methyltetrahydrofolate is a poor substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Our studies demonstrate that CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 metabolism is potently inhibited in the presence of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 6, and suggest that incorporation of plasma CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 will only occur when methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is inhibited by adenosylmethionine and cellular pools of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 6 are at very low levels...|$|E

30|$|Molecular {{profiling}} of the fpgs 03 g knockout {{line has}} generated several {{new insights into}} the regulation of folate homeostasis in plants. Firstly, LC-MS/MS metabolite profiling of fpgs 03 g seed revealed a reduction in both mono- and polyglutamylated folate forms (Table  2). This result is in agreement with previous studies from a number of organisms which show that folate polyglutamylation is involved in retention and homeostasis of folates (Desouza et al. 2000; Lin et al. 1993; Lin and Shane, 1994). The reduction in <b>monoglutamated</b> folates may be a result of folate breakdown, as polyglutamylated protein-bound folates are less susceptible to oxidative breakdown (Suh et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|The folates {{present in}} liver, gut and tumour tissue were {{examined}} {{before and after}} autolysis. Before autolysis 10 -formylfolate tetraglutamate (10 -CHOFA(glu) 4), 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate triglutamate (5 -CH 3 THF(glu) 3) and possibly tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate(s) (THF(glu) n) were detected. Liver contained all 3 species whereas no 5 -CH 3 THF(glu) 3 was present in the tumours; gut showed an intermediate situation. After autolysis the predominant <b>monoglutamates</b> formed were 5 -CH 3 THF in the liver, 10 -formylfolates in the gut and possibly tetrahydrofolate (THF) in the tumour extracts.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} determination of folates in rodent diets {{is very important}} for correct interpretation of folate intake during feeding trials, given the possible discrepancy between the actual folate concentration in the diet and that mentioned on the product sheet. Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry is the method of choice to differentiate and quantify the individual folate species present. This discrepancy may be accounted for by, e. g., inaccurate folic acid supplementation and/or the presence of endogenous reduced and substituted folates. We developed a method, validated based on FDA guidelines, that allows the measurement of added and endogenous folates by quantitative determination of 5 folate <b>monoglutamates</b> with linear ranges from 8 mu g to 2 mg/kg feed. This information, combined with feed intake data, allows insight into the actual folate intake in animal feeding studies. The relevance of this method was illustrated by the analysis of several feed samples of varying composition, by the investigation of the effect of casein incorporation, and by evaluating the variability of the folate content between pellets and production batches...|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, {{this study}} has shown that germination, the {{developmental}} stage reported to generate the greatest demand for folates (Jabrin et al. 2003, Gambonnet et al. 2001), was not affected in the fpgs 03 g mutant. This suggests that the remaining rice FPGS gene Os 10 g 35940 can compensate for the lack of Os 03 g 02030 activity during germination. Alternatively, this modification to folate polyglutamylation activity may not be essential during germination and embryo development such that enzymes normally dependent on polyglutamated folates are able to substitute them with monoglutamated folate forms. This idea could be supported by elevating of the transcript levels of GTPCHI, ADC synthase and HPPK/DHPS, <b>monoglutamate</b> folate synthesis genes, indicating the increasing of <b>monoglutamate</b> folate production. However, these possibilities will require the characterisation of the phenotype of plants lacking both rice FPGS genes.|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{labelled}} {{folic acid}} was administerd to rats. Exposure to N 2 O {{was used to}} give an insight into the major route of scission within the <b>monoglutamate</b> pool, results suggest that THF formed during transport from the gut lumen to the plasma is the major route of scission within the gut. Peroxides in corn oil and arising {{as a result of}} lipid peroxidation and autoxidation increase catabolism of the <b>monoglutamate</b> pool and decrease incorporation of administered folates into the polyglutamate pool. It is suggested that peroxides may oxidise B 12 resulting in inhibition of methionine synthetase, this results in diminished polyglutamation and increased urinary excretion of 5 CH 3 THF. Fats undergo peroxidation within tissues, the resulting peroxides increase catabolism of the polyglutamate pool. It is suggested that the NBT assay may reflect polyglutamate breakdown. Antioxidants such as vitamin E (and DES) decrease catabolism of the <b>monoglutamate</b> pool. Administration of DES resulted in changes similar to those observed during malignancy, it is suggested that these changes may precede the onset of tumour development. Vitamin E elevates brain DHPR activity. Since lowered DHPR levels and disturbed THB metabolism have been observed in aging and Down's syndrome it is proposed that vitamin E therapy may prove beneficial in situations where oxidative stress is increased. Brain DHPR activity was increased on administration of peroxides suggesting that in situations of oxidative stress (which may result in increased catabolism of THB) the salvage pathway may be stimulated and loss of THB minimised. N 2 O exposure had no effect on THB metabolism suggesting that the stimulatory role of 5 CH 3 THF is due to its role as a methyl donor...|$|E

In this study, broccoli {{was used as}} a case study. Regarding the folate poly-gamma-glutamate profile, endogenous folate poly-gamma-glutamates in broccoli florets were found predominantly as hepta- and hexa-gamma-glutamates. Crushing raw broccoli, acidification and LTLT blanching enhanced folate deconjugation resulting in <b>monoglutamate,</b> di- and tri-gamma-glutamates. Compared to other treatments, HTST blanching preformed prior to crushing resulted in the highest concentration of long chain poly-gamma-glutamates. Regarding folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability, acidification combined with LTLT blanching decreased folate stability whereas HTST blanching combined with different sequences of blanching and crushing did not affect folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability. It was concluded that crushing (prior to heating), acidification and blanching could be strategically applied to increase the folate <b>monoglutamate</b> content of broccoli. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{prevalence}} of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal disease patients, its treatment by folate administration, and its aggravation by the 677 C→T mutation of methylene-tetrahydrofolate (methylene-THF) reductase has established the folate cycle {{as an important}} factor in the pathogenesis and management of renal disease. Proper function of the folate cycle depends on normal function of involved enzymes adequate of the vitamin and its correct disposition within the body. Vital processes in folate disposition include conversion of dietary folylpolyglutamates to <b>monoglutamates,</b> intestinal absorption, receptor and carrier-mediated transport across cell membranes, and cellular export. Folate coenzymes are responsible for the one-carbon unit transfer in intermediary metabolism and are required for several reactions in key metabolic processes, for example of purine, pyrimidine and methionine synthesis, and glycine and serine metabolism. Methionine synthase and its recently discovered reducing protein as well as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase are key folate enzymes in homocysteine metabolism. Deficiencies of these enzymes are important causes of severe disease in the rare remethylation defects causing homocystinuria.

An {{analytical}} method for extraction, purification and liquid chromatography−electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry detection of low level, labile tetrahydrofolate <b>monoglutamates</b> from Arabidopsis thaliana was developed in this study. Under gold fluorescent light, folates were extracted by homogenizing the leaves in extraction buffer and heating the homogenate.

The resulting extract containing the monoglutamyl folates was then applied to an agarose affinity column containing folate binding protein which was purified from milk whey. After elution from the affinity column, the folates were separated and identified by liquid chromatography−electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry on a 150 × 0. 32 mm Symmetry 300 C 18 column using isocratic elution with mobile phase (0. 1 % formic acid/ 95 % acetonitrile, containing 0. 1 % formic acid, 88 : 12) at a flow rate of 0. 3 µl/min. In positive ion mode, ions representing 5 -methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid, 5 -formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid and 5, 10 -methenyl-tetrahydrofolic acid were detected and identified.

40|$|The reduced folate carrier (RFC), a {{bidirectional}} anion transporter, is {{the major}} uptake route of reduced folates essential for a spectrum of biochemical reactions and thus cellular proliferation. However, here we show that ectopic overexpression of the RFC, but not of folate receptor α, a high affinity unidirectional folate uptake route serving here as a negative control, resulted in an ∼ 15 -fold decline in cellular viability in medium lacking folates but not in folate-containing medium. Moreover to explore possible mechanisms of adaptation to folate deficiency in various cell lines that express the endogenous RFC, we first determined the gene expression status of the following genes: (a) RFC, (b) ATP-driven folate exporters (i. e. MRP 1, MRP 5, and breast cancer resistance protein), and (c) folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase and γ-glutamate hydrolase (GGH), enzymes catalyzing folate polyglutamylation and hydrolysis, respectively.

40|$|The vacuoles of pea (Pisum sativum) {{leaves and}} red beet (Beta vulgaris) storage root are major {{sites for the}} {{intracellular}} compartmentation of folates. In the light of these findings and preliminary experiments indicating that some plant multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) subfamily ATP-binding cassette transporters are able to transport compounds of this type, the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar MRP, AtMRP 1 (AtABCC 1), and its functional equivalent(s) in vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from red beet storage root were studied. In so doing, it has been determined that heterologously expressed AtMRP 1 and its equivalents in red beet vacuolar membranes are not only competent in the transport of glutathione conjugates but also folate <b>monoglutamates</b> and antifolates as exemplified by pteroyl-l-glutamic acid and methotrexate (MTX), respectively. In agreement {{with the results of}} these in vitro transport measurements, analyses of atmrp 1 T-DNA insertion mutants of Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskia and Columbia disclose an MTX-hypersensitive phenotype. atmrp 1 knock-out mutants are more sensitive than wild-type plants to growth retardation by nanomolar concentrations of MTX, and this is associated with impaired vacuolar antifolate sequestration. The vacuoles of protoplasts isolated from the leaves of Wassilewskia atmrp 1 mutants accumulate 50 % less [3 H]MTX than the vacuoles of protoplasts from wild-type plants when incubated in media containing nanomolar concentrations of this antifolate, and vacuolar membrane-enriched vesicles purified from the mutant catalyze MgATP-dependent [3 H]MTX uptake at only 40 % of the capacity of the equivalent membrane fraction from wild-type plants. AtMRP 1 and its counterparts in other plant species therefore have the potential for participating in the vacuolar accumulation of folates and related compounds...|$|R
40|$|Background: Before dietary folate is absorbed, {{polyglutamate}} folates are deconjugated to <b>monoglutamates</b> by folylpoly-gamma-glutamyl carboxypeptidase in {{the small}} intestine. The 1561 T allele of the glutamate carboxypeptidase II gene (GCPII), which codes for folylpoly-gamma-glutamyl carboxypeptidase, may impair intestinal absorption of dietary folates. Objective: Our aim was to study the bioavailability of polyglutamyl folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid across GCPII 1561 genotypes. Design: In a randomized study, 180 healthy adults aged 50 - 75 y received 323 nmol monoglutamyl folic acid/d (n = 59), 262 nmol heptaglutamyl folic acid/d (n = 61), or placebo (n = 60) for 12 wk. Genotypes were assessed after the intervention. The bioavailability of heptaglutamyl folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid was calculated by using the changes in serum folate concentration in the treatment groups, after correction {{for changes in the}} placebo group and for the administered dose. Results: No subjects with the TT genotype were encountered. At baseline, serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were higher (P < 0. 05) in subjects with the CT genotype [16. 3 nmol/L (geometric (x) over bar; 95 % CI: 13. 7, 19. 3 nmol/L) and 863 nmol/L (735, 1012 nmol/L), respectively; n = 19] than in subjects with the CC genotype [13. 7 (13. 1, 14. 3) and 685 (652, 721) nmol/L, respectively; n = 161]. Baseline homocysteine concentrations were not significantly different between genotypes. The bioavailability of heptaglutamyl folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid was not significantly different between subjects with the CC (64 %; 52 %, 76 %) and CT genotypes (70 %; 49 %, 91 %). Conclusions: The 1561 T allele of the GCPII gene does not impair the bioavailability of polyglutamyl folic acid. However, the allele is associated with higher folate status. This association may be explained by yet unidentified factors controlling the expression of the GCPII gene...|$|R

Pteroylpolyglutamates containing either three or seven glutamate residues were prepared by the solid-phase method permitting placement of carbon- 14 labels in either the pteridine ring or in a selected glutamate unit of the gamma peptide chain. Complete dissociation was observed between biological folate activity and radioactivity of plasma after ingestion of pteroyltriglutamate labeled in the middle glutamate.

Unidirectional transmural flux determination also did not indicate a significant net flux.

40|$|Methyltetrahydrofolate synchronizes the {{activities}} of the two branches of the pathway of methionine biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa by serving as an essential activator of cystathionine γ-synthase and antagonizing the feedback inhibition of this enzyme by S-adenosylmethionine. Activation is specific for the methylated form of folate and increases with increasing glutamate content. The inability of extracts of me- 1 and me- 6 mutants to form cystathionine that has been previously reported is due to the absence of N 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate from these preparations. Extracts of me- 1 mutants lack methyltetrahydrofolate because the organisms are deficient in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and those of me- 6 because their methyltetrahydrofolate is quantitatively removed by the procedure employed in the preparation of extracts. The folate of the me- 6 organisms differs from that of wild type strains in consisting largely of the <b>monoglutamate</b> rather than higher conjugates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe present {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} the folate metabolism enzyme methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) in mitochondria. MTHFS activity was identified in the matrix of mitochondria purified from human liver biopsies. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MTHFS specific activities are similar, 85 % of the total cellular MTHFS activity is in the cytoplasm and both native enzymes have similar molecular weights (approximately 25 kDa). Studies using purified mitochondrial MTHFS from CA 46 human Burkitt lymphoma cells reveal that mitochondrial MTHFS behaves kinetically like the cytoplasmic enzyme with Km values of 4. 7, 0. 8 and 22 μM respectively for (6 R,S) - 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate <b>monoglutamate,</b> (6 S) - 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate and ATP. This finding adds to previous observations that various folate-dependent enzymes reside in the mitochondria of eucaryotic cells. Intracellular tetrahydrofolate metabolism is highly compartmentalized and mitochondrial MTHFS activity is necessary for the entry of mitochondrial 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate into the mitochondrial folate pool...|$|E
