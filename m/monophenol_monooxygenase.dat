The activities of laccase and tyrosine phenol lyase (EC 4. 1. 99. 2) are absent in this organism. The <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> catalyzes hydroxylation of monophenols (Km and Vmax for l-tyrosine, 2 × 10 − 4 M and 8. 0 nmol of O 2 /min per ml, respectively) {{at a slower}} rate than it dehydrogenates diphenols to o-quinones (Km and Vmax for l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine, 7 × 10 − 5 M and 51. 7 nmol of O 2 /min per ml, respectively. It is inhibited by KCN, β-mercaptoethanol, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, dipyridyl, thiourea, p-aminobenzoic acids and by some tryptophan metabolites.

For the fabrication of enzyme-based biosensor, composite matrix of natural biopolymers agar-Abelmoschus escucentus gum {{was used to}} immobilize <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> and o-diphenol oxidase. L-tyrosine and L-dopa were used as substrate for the measurement of phenol. <b>Monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> and o-diphenol oxidase oxidizes phenolic substrate to the corresponding quinone to allow convenient low-potential detection of phenolic analyte. In the enzymatic catalysis, reduction of quinone to phenol was also observed using (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a platinum electrode. The Vmax for tyrosine and dopa is 102. 4 and 108. 2 μM/litre/min where as Km is 11. 26 X 10 - 3 mM and 11. 90 X 10 - 3 mM respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT-Malignant melanomas {{have been}} shown to contain high levels of <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> (tyrosinase) enzyme activity; the enzyme is {{responsible}} for melanin synthesis. The melanoma of Sinclair miniature swine has a high incidence of spontaneous regression and thus provides a unique system for analyzing changes in tyrosinase activity at various tumor stages. Three tumor stages (progressively growing tumors. partially regressed tumors. and fully regressed tumors) were analyzed for tyrosinase activity. The progressing tumors were 34 -fold higher than were the partially regressed lesions and 400 -fold higher than were the fully regressed tumors. Histologically, the decrease in enzyme activity correlated with a loss of tumor cells. Sequential biopsies of tumors during the course of tumor development showed a positive correspondence between tumor volume and tyrosinase activity for the early and late stages of tumor growt...|$|E
40|$|A-factor (2 -isocapryloyl- 3 R-hydroxymethil-γ-butyro-lactone) is an {{essential}} hormonal regulator for morphological development, as well as streptomycin and yellow pigment productions in Streptomyces griseus. By UV-treatment, three mutants that were deficient in yellow pigment production but showed normal morphologiical development and strptomycin production were obtained. A 7. 5 kb-DNA fragment, which restored the yellow pigment production {{in one of the}} mutants, was shotguncloned from a chromosomal DNA of wild-type SS. griseus. Sequence analysis of this fragment showed that it contained 6 complete open reading frmaes including melC 1 and melC 2. MelC 2 and MelC 1 have high sequence similarity to monophenol monooxygenases and co-factors of the enzyme, respectively. Because a melCC 2 -disrupted strain showed yellow pigment deficient phenotype, it was probable that the <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> homologue is involved in the biosynthesis of the yellow pigment...|$|E
40|$|Melanoma cells {{express a}} {{phenotype}} that {{is easy to}} recognize: the synthesis of melanin. We used this marker to isolate clones of amelanotic variants from large populations of wild-type melanotic clones. Cloudman mouse melanoma (S 91, clone M- 3, CCL 53. 1) {{was chosen as the}} parental line because the cells are highly pigmented, grow well as clones in soft agar, and fuse readily with Sendai virus. Subclones (107) of this line were screened without prior mutagenesis, and nine amelanotic variants were isolated. The mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate increased the frequency of variants by three to four orders of magnitude. Wild-type cells had both basal and melanocyte stimulating hormone-inducible tyrosinase activities. The four amelanotic variants that we have examined to date all behaved similarly: they lost basal tyrosinase (EC 1. 14. 18. 1; <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase)</b> activity but retained melanocyte stimulating hormone-inducible activity; they contained Stage-II melanosomes but no melanized melanosomes; they exhibited growth characteristics similar to those of wild-type cells in culture but produced fewer tumors in mice...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the chemotherapeutic potential of 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine, a targeted prodrug {{that can be}} hydroxylated by tyrosinase (<b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase,</b> EC 1. 14. 18. 1) within melanoma cells to form the cellular toxin 2, 4, 5 -trihydroxyphenylalanine (6 -hydroxydopa). 2, 4 -Dihydroxyphenylalanine proved to be cytotoxic to both B- 16 and Cloudman melanoma cells in vitro. The immediate effects of 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine included inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses. In contrast, no decrease in macromolecular synthesis or viability was seen against cultures of MJY-alpha mammary tumor or L- 1210 leukemia, two cell types that do not contain tyrosinase. Within the melanoma cultures, greater cytotoxicity was seen against melanotic (tyrosinase-containing) cells than against amelanotic (tyrosinase-lacking) cells. The cytotoxicity of 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine was blocked by 1 -phenylthiourea, an inhibitor of tyrosinase. These results show that 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine is toxic to melanoma cells and that activation of 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine requires the presence of tyrosinase...|$|E

Rapid discolouration of leaf, stem and root tissue after injury and strong pigmentation of tissue extracts indicate that PPO and phenolic compounds are ubiquitous in vegetative tissue of banana as well. They hamper biochemical and molecular studies in banana, as cumbersome adaptations of extraction protocols are required. On the other hand, PPO and phenolic compounds could be {{an important part of}} the plant's defence system against pests and diseases, including root parasitic nematodes. To facilitate future studies in this area, extraction and assay conditions for PPO from roots of banana (Musa acuminata AAA, Grande naine) were optimized. Highest enzyme activities were obtained in a 0. 2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 with 5 % insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0. 25 % Triton X- 100. The lowest Km values were obtained for dopamine and D-catechin. Monophenolase activity was shown with p-cresol. Banana root PPO was strongly inhibited by dithiothreitol and sodium metabisulfite. In root sections, oxidation of dopamine strongly co-localized with aerenchyma in the cortex. The experiments revealed indications for the involvement of root PPO and dopamine in resistance of banana against the parasitic nematode Radopholus similis. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

The field trial which includes various variants of planting density and vine training systems, {{made it possible to}} study the influence of viticulture practices on the criteria of carbohydrate - acid and phenolic complex, oxidative enzyme system of grapes. Low - density plantings of Aromatnyi variety (2222 vines per ha) were characterized by harvest that slightly exceeded the grapes obtained from dense plantations (4000 vines per ha) in terms of carbohydrate - acid and phenolic complexes. The most optimal in terms of the mass concentration of sugars, phenolic substances, polymer forms, macerating ability of must, activity of oxidizing enzyme system was cultivation of this variety on a 160 cm – high trunk. Growing grapes of Zagrey variety with vine spacing, corresponding to 4000 plants per ha, contributed to obtaining harvest with optimal parameters of carbohydrate - acid complex, low technological reserve and mass concentration of phenolic compounds, moderate macerating ability and activity of <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> in must.

The pigment composition in the floral part correlated well with the flower colour, supporting these components as idoneous chemotaxonomic markers. Among seven cultivars examined, three were orange-yellow and contained carthamin (red) and precarthamin, safflor yellow A and safflor yellow B (orange-yellow) (type 0). There were bright-yellow and also had the above four pigments (type Y). The seventh cultivar was ivory-white and produced no quinoidal chalcones in the florets (type W). Relative activities of three different enzymes were examined in soluble protein extracts from etiolated seedlings of the garden varieties. <b>Monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> (EC 1. 14. 18. 1) and peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 7.) were distributed over all cultivars tested. The relative level of the enzyme activities could be ordered as follows: type 0, type W and type Y. The activity of a carthamin-synthesizing enzyme was found in the protein extracts from all garden forms examined. Its activity was most prominent in type O. The activity level in type W was inferior to that of type O. The catalytic intensity in type Y was found to even lower.

40|$|Cholera toxin (choleragen) and {{melanocyte}} stimulating hormone alter {{within hours}} the morphology of melanoma cells in culture, and they slow {{the growth of}} serum-stimulated cells. After 7 - 10 days, cells exposed to choleragen or hormone show increased size and a fibroblastic growth pattern. Tyrosinase (EC 1. 14. 18. 1; <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase)</b> activity increases after 3 days {{in the presence of}} 10 - 8 M hormone or 10 - 10 M choleragen. Binding studies with 125 I-labeled choleragen indicate that although a melanoma cell can bind a maximum of 106 molecules of cholera toxin, only about 4000 binding sites must be occupied to achieve maximum stimulation of tyrosinase activity. Melanocyte stimulating hormone and choleragen probably have different membrane-binding sites. After exposure to choleragen for 5 min, membrane adenylate cyclase (EC 4. 6. 1. 1) activity increases dramatically upon further incubation of intact cells for several hours at 37 ° and falls slowly to basal values over a period of more than 10 days. Hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase is rapidly reversed by washing the cells, but subsequent restimulation of cyclase by the hormone is impaired. These studies indicate that cAMP mediates the effects of melanocyte stimulating hormone on growth and morphology as well as on tyrosinase activity. Cholera toxin may permanently activate the available adenylate cyclase molecules, and the protracted decay of stimulation that follows may reflect the biological turnover of adenylate cyclase molecules in these cells...|$|E

The distribution of electron equivalents among the redox sites {{was found to}} be reductant dependent. When the data for titration by various reductants of the type 3 site were plotted against those of the type 1 site according to the Nernst formalism, the slope n varied from 2. 0 to 1. 0. The redox potential of the reductant's first oxidation step is qualitatively correlated with the value of n and is suggested as the factor that modulates the electron distribution. Such a behavior implies a nonequilibrium situation. A very good simulation of the data was provided by an analysis assuming a formally variable cooperativity between the two type 3 copper ions. This apparent variability is suggested to result from a process whereby sufficiently strong reductants induce a transition of the type 3 site from a cooperative two-electron acceptor to a pair of independent one-electron acceptors. This uncoupled state of the type 3 site is considered metastable. Other possible models were also investigated. Summarizing the available data, we conclude that the two-electron accepting behavior of the 330 -nm chromophore is {{the exception rather than the}} rule...|$|E
40|$|Phenoloxidases (<b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase,</b> EC 1. 14. 18. 1; {{catechol}} oxidase, EC 1. 10. 3. 1) are a {{group of}} enzymes with copper cofactors that produce reactive quinones and {{are part of the}} melanin synthesis pathway, both of which have important roles in immunity. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which according to genome annotation is deficient in many other immune system components, codes for two phenoloxidase proteins that represent putative dimer components and possess the amino acid residues contributing to the active site. Constitutive phenoloxidase activity was detectible in the pea aphid hemolymph. It was activated by both conformational change with methanol and proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide with trypsin. Phenoloxidase activity was not significantly altered by aseptic wounding or infection studies with Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus. Phylogenetic analysis of insect phenoloxidases yielded a topology consistent with a lineage-specific duplication in each order (including Hemiptera). The possibility that the topology could be generated by a duplication, probably in the ancestral insect, followed by coevolution between the two phenoloxidase subunits within each order, was explored but rejected. The three-dimensional structures of the pea aphid phenoloxidases were reconstructed by homology modeling. The models of all three possible dimeric states of phenoloxidase (two homodimers and one heterodimer) did not exhibit conformational change in response to propeptide cleavage and their conformation differed from other modeled insect phenoloxidases. Taken together, these results suggest that the pea aphid has a functional phenoloxidase, but that it may be activated and function in a different way from the phenoloxidases in previously-studied insects...|$|E
30|$|ARDRA {{analysis}} and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing classified AK 21 as S. meliloti. Eckhardt lysis analysis of plasmid content revealed {{the presence of}} three major replicons, probably corresponding to the chromosome, pSymA and pSymB, and a cryptic plasmid of about 120  kb in size (Ibragimova et al. 2006; M. Bazzicalupo personal communication). Our SSH data are consistent with this experimental evidence, because we found proteins involved in plasmid replication/partitioning from the repABC family to be exclusive to S. meliloti AK 21. Moreover, we identified several genes usually carried by accessory plasmids, including a putative mobilization module TraG/Vir (pSmeSM 11 a) and a <b>monophenol</b> <b>monooxygenase</b> gene (pRmeGR 4 b). These accessory plasmids carry genes that could confer an adaptive advantage on the host bacterium and they are widespread and interchangeable between natural rhizobial populations (more than 50 % of rhizobia harbor at least one cryptic plasmid; Mercado-Blanco and Toro 1996; Stiens et al. 2006; Galardini et al. 2013 b). Thus, the rhizobitoxine biosynthesis operon identified in S. meliloti AK 21 may be present on the accessory plasmid. This phytotoxin was first described in Bradyrhizobium species as being associated with leaf chlorosis in susceptible host plants (Ruan and Peters 1992; Ruan et al. 1993). It is also produced by other pathogenic microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, and has recently been found {{in a group of}} S. medicae isolates (Bailly et al. 2011). Rhizobitoxine interferes with ethylene synthesis in plant tissues, by inhibiting the ACC synthase (Yuhashi et al. 2000; Sugawara et al. 2006). Likewise, the acdS gene {{has been shown to be}} present on pSmeSM 11 a, one of the accessory plasmids of S. meliloti SM 11 (Stiens et al. 2006). It encodes an ACC deaminase that metabolizes the precursor of the phytohormone ethylene, thereby enhancing nodulation (Ma et al. 2004). Similar strategies for the improvement of nodulation, through the inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis, could thus be mediated by accessory genes, conferring fitness advantages for the symbiotic interaction. The presence of these genes on transmissible plasmids would facilitate spread within the population of bacteria in the soil.|$|E
40|$|The {{irreversible}} and reversible {{inhibition of}} glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) by eugenol was studied in rat, mouse and man. Using liver cytosol of human, rat and mouse, species {{differences were found}} in the rate of irreversible inhibition of GSTs by eugenol {{in the presence of the}} enzyme tyrosinase. Tyrosinase was used to oxidize eugenol. No inhibition was observed in the absence of tyrosinase. The rate of irreversible inhibition of GSTs was highest in mouse cytosol, and lowest in rat cytosol. In addition, the irreversible inhibition of human and rat GSTs by eugenol was studied using purified isoenzymes of man and rat. The human GST isoenzymes A 1 - 1, M 1 a- 1 a and P 1 - 1 and the rat GST isoenzymes 1 - 1, 2 - 2, 3 - 3, 4 - 4 and 7 - 7 were irreversibly inhibited by eugenol in the presence of tyrosinase. In this respect human GST P 1 - 1 and rat GST 7 - 7 were by far the most sensitive enzymes; human GST A 2 - 2 was not inhibited. indications were found that human GST P 1 - 1 may be inhibited via three mechanisms: in addition to the well documentated nucleophilic addition of quinones and oxidation of cysteine residues, a covalent subunit cross-linking was also observed. The reversible inhibition of human and rat GST by eugenol, eugenol methyl ether, isoeugenol methyl ether, 2 -allylphenol and 4 -propylphenol was also studied using purified isoenzymes. The reversible inhibition of human and rat GSTs, using 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene as substrate, was expressed as It, All compounds caused moderate reversible inhibition (I 25 ranged from 0. 2 to 5. 4 mM for human GSTs and from 0. 4 to 4. 9 mM for rat GSTs). In rat, eugenol methyl ether was the strongest inhibitor. In human, the overall inhibiting capacities of eugenol, eugenol methyl ether, isoeugenol methyl ether and 4 -propyl phenol were more or less similar; 2 -allylphenol was the poorest inhibitor.
