At the time the maximum field strength with a resistive magnet was about 0.1T. With a cryogenic magnet, 1.0 T was easily achieved. EMI Medical went bankrupt at around this time so their interests in MRI were bought by GEC. This was a major impetus for GEC's acquisition of Picker Corporation in 1981.|$|E

In 1987, he founded Time Domain Corporation to develop and market technologies such as ultra-wideband radio transmission technology. He also co-founded SoundBlast Technologies LLC in 2006 to develop his unique coherent detonation wave invention. His SoundBlast invention eliminates the deflagration process {{in the creation of a}} detonation wave in a short tube, enabling a timing accuracy of sub 20µs. This timing accuracy allows for the assembly of very useful arrays of coherent detonation tubes. His detonation wave technology has applications in propulsion, weapons, and as a high energy impulse seismic source.

50|$|Principle: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{exploits}} {{the nuclear}} magnetic alignments of different atoms inside {{a magnetic field}} to generate images. MRI machines consist of large magnets that generate magnetic fields around the target of analysis. These magnetic fields cause paramagnetic atoms such as hydrogen, gadolinium, and manganese to align themselves in a magnetic dipole along the magnetic fields, created by the radiofrequency (RF) coils inside the MRI machine. What the machine captures from the subject is the relaxation of the atoms as they return to their normal alignment when the RF pulse is temporarily ceased. With this data, a computer will generate {{an image of the}} subject based on the resonance characteristics of different tissue types.Since 2012, the use of cryogen-free <b>magnet</b> <b>technology</b> has greatly reduced infrastructure requirements and dependency on the availability of increasingly hard to obtain cryogenic coolants.|$|E

During a trip in 1985 to Germany they both discussed the emerging power and capability of Personal Computers and how this would change the way engineers design products. The initial vision, to write engineering design software for PC’s then took form. Working on early microprocessor computers, initial prototype analysis software was commenced in order to formulate interfaces and capabilities. However, {{it became apparent that}} in order to catch the wave of new software emanating from the USA they decided to acquire UK distribution rights for selected applications.
