5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E

5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E

40|$|Characteristic {{signs of}} {{malignant}} hyperthermia (MH) include unexplained tachycardia, increased end-tidal carbon dioxide (Etco 2) concentration, <b>metabolic</b> and respiratory <b>acidosis,</b> {{and an increase}} in body temperature above 38. 8 °C. We present the case of a patient with highly probable MH. In addition to sinus tachycardia and <b>metabolic</b> and respiratory <b>acidosis,</b> this patient also had a negative arterial to Etco 2 gradient and an increased requirement for minute ventilation to maintain a normal Etco 2 concentration, with signs of increased CO 2 production. Despite these signs of MH, the patient's rectal temperature monitoring equipment did not show an increase in temperature, although the temperature measured in the mouth was increased. This case illustrates the unreliability of measuring rectal temperature as a means of reflecting body temperature during MH and the usefulness of increased CO 2 production signs in helping to diagnose MH...|$|R
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
40|$|Propofol {{infusion}} {{syndrome is}} a recognized complication of prolonged propofol {{use in the}} pediatric population, but little is reported on other metabolic effects of propofol, especially in children with mitochondrial disorders. We report on a child with <b>metabolic</b> encephalopathy, lactic <b>acidosis,</b> and stroke-like syndrome who received a single dose of propofol for procedural seda-tion. The patient’s initial presentation was consistent with a mild exacerbation of her underlying disease. She received a single dose of propofol and non–dextrose-containing fluids during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to rule out stroke and progressed to develop severe acidosis, neurologic deterioration, and cardiorespiratory compromise. This is the first case report of severe metabolic disturbances after a single dose of propofol administered for procedural sedation in a patient with <b>metabolic</b> encephalopathy, lactic <b>acidosis,</b> and stroke-like syndrome and it questions the safety of propofol and absence of dextrose infusions during an acute illness in patients with mitochondrial disorders...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The primary aim was {{to compare}} the working {{capacity}} in patients with continent urinary diversion with a control group. Secondary aims were to assess the changes in electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis and the functional status during strenuous physical activity, and finally, the well-being in the two groups. Methods: Eleven patients who had undergone radical cystectomy and continent cutaneous diversion using an ileocolonic segment participated. The control group consisted of 12 men, matched for age and activity level. Working capacity was assessed by ergospirometry on an exercise bicycle. Venous blood samples were taken before the test, when the expiratory exchange ratio (RER) was about 1. 0 and immediately after completion of the test. SF- 36 {{was used to evaluate}} the subject's functional status and well-being. Results: The median working capacity in the patient group was 155 (85190) W and 155 (125 - 215) W in the control group (n. s.) corresponding to 72 (43 - 97) % and 80 (59 - 97) % respectively of predicted values. Peak oxygen uptake was somewhat low in both groups when compared to P-O Astrands norms. Blood tests revealed that patients developed a slight <b>metabolic</b> hyperchloremic <b>acidosis,</b> not seen in the control group. There were no differences between the groups as assessed with SF- 36. Conclusion: Patients with a continent urinary diversion have a working capacity equal to a control group despite a slight <b>metabolic</b> hyperchloremic <b>acidosis.</b> Quality of life was similar in the two groups and corresponded well with the norms for the general Swedish population aged 65 to 74.

5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
50|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, the baby may develop {{ventilatory}} failure (rising carbon dioxide {{concentrations in the}} blood), and prolonged cessations of breathing ("apnea"). Whether treated or not, the clinical course for the acute disease lasts about 2 to 3 days. During the first day the patient worsens and requires more support. During the second day the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support and resolution is noted during the third day, heralded by a prompt diuresis. Despite huge advances in care, IRDS remains the most common single {{cause of death in}} the first month of life in the developed world. Complications include <b>metabolic</b> disorders (<b>acidosis,</b> low blood sugar), patent ductus arteriosus, low blood pressure, chronic lung changes, and bleeding in the brain.

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
40|$|Background. During {{the chronic}} stage of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), {{impaired}} microcirculation {{is related to}} increased vasoconstriction, tissue hypoxia, and <b>metabolic</b> tissue <b>acidosis</b> in the affected limb.

The diminished blood flow may be caused by either sympathetic dysfunction, hypersensitivity to circulating catecholamines, or endothelial dysfunction. The pain may be of neuropathic, inflammatory, nociceptive, or functional nature, or of mixed origin. Summary. The origin of the pain should be the basis of the symptomatic therapy. Since the difference in temperature between both hands fluctuates over time in cold CRPS, when in doubt, the clinician should prioritize the patient's report of a persistent cold extremity over clinical tests that show no difference.

Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin, the deficiency of which creates anemia (macrocytic anemia), decreased bone marrow cell production (anemia, pancytopenia), neurological problems, as well as <b>metabolic</b> issues (methylmalonyl-CoA <b>acidosis).</b>|$|R
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
