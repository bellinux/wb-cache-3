50|$|Any archaeological layer {{deposited}} in an unconsolidated form will tend towards a horizontal disposition. Strata which are found with tilted surfaces were so <b>originally</b> <b>deposited,</b> or lie {{in conformity with}} the contours of a pre-existing basin of deposition.|$|R
50|$|The Peninsula Formation (800-1500m thick) {{consisting}} of hard, light grey medium to coarse grained pebbly quartz sandstone, dominates the steep mountain cliffs. Current bedding and pebble layers {{suggest that it}} was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> as migrating sand bars in broad river channels.|$|R
50|$|The Devil’s Punch Bowl {{originated}} 450 {{million years}} ago when materials that form the Niagara escarpment were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> in an inland sea. Corals and other organisms that lived in the area became fossilized as the sea bottom deposits changed into rocks.|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks of}} Raven Ridge were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> {{on or near}} a shore line as {{horizontal}} sedimentary layers within the Uinta Basin. Uplift and folding associated with the later stages of the Laramide Orogeny subsequently tilted them into a nearly vertical position.|$|R
25|$|A derived, {{reworked}} or remanié fossil is {{a fossil}} found in rock that accumulated significantly later {{than when the}} fossilized animal or plant died. Reworked fossils are created by erosion exhuming (freeing) fossils from the rock formation {{in which they were}} <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> and their redeposition in an younger sedimentary deposit.|$|R
50|$|The rocks exposed {{along the}} stretch of coast near Ogmore-by-Sea were laid down between 340 and 195 million years ago. They are all {{sedimentary}} rocks, <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> as lime, mud, sand and coarse pebbles, and {{over long periods of}} time these were compacted and solidified into limestone, shale and conglomerate.|$|R
5000|$|The Principle of Original Horizontality {{states that}} layers of {{sediment}} are <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> horizontally under {{the action of}} gravity [...] It is a relative dating technique. The principle {{is important to the}} analysis of folded and tilted strata. It was first proposed by the Danish geological pioneer Nicholas Steno (1638-1686).|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} this beetle {{is an area}} of low sand dunes on the Cromwell river terrace, known as the “Cromwell shallow sand”. The dunes are formed by loess <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> by the Clutha River. As P. lewisi seems to be adapted to {{burrowing}} in these inland dunes, its entire natural range was probably never more than 500 hectares.|$|R

50|$|The Emsian {{stratigraphy}} of {{the southern}} Rhenish Massif {{can be divided into}} two lithological units: the older slates of the Hunsrück-Schiefer and the younger sandstones of the Singhofener Schichten. Stratigraphically below the Hunsrück Slates is the (older) Taunus quartzite. All these metasedimentary rocks were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> in the marine Rhenohercynian Basin, a back-arc basin south of the paleocontinent of Laurussia.|$|R
50|$|Next, {{pyroclastic}} flows {{moved through}} the region, sometimes at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour, depositing {{the bulk of the}} Huckleberry Ridge tuff. The tuff was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> evenly across the area when the region was lower than surrounding hills. Deposits from streams just beneath the Huckleberry Ridge tuff show that this area was at a low elevation just before the eruption.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Town Mountain granite--tightly-dated to late Mesoproterozoic times--is a minor mystery, {{stemming}} from a debate {{over whether or not}} it is related to the Grenville orogeny. What is not in doubt in that the Valley Spring and Packsaddle formations are heavily metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> south of the North American craton, and altered by subduction or continental collision.|$|R
50|$|Chalk {{is a kind}} of limestone, made of {{the mineral}} calcite, or calcium carbonate. It was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny {{micro-organisms}} called Coccolithophore. It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings. The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of gypsum or calcium sulphate, a powder pressed into sticks.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{customer}} would usually pay interest {{to borrow from}} a bank, so they pay the bank an amount {{which is more than}} the amount they borrowed; or {{a customer}} may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they <b>originally</b> <b>deposited.</b> In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower.|$|R
50|$|However {{interest}} in Nicolai renewed in the 1990s {{and the music}} historian Michael Wittmann {{was finally able to}} reconstruct Il templario from various versions. These included a revision <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> with the local censor in Naples but found in the Conservatorio di Musica under the title Teodosia, a German language edition, and also a French piano-vocal score, which allowed for the complete reconstruction in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The Helvetic nappes (Helvetische Decken) are {{a series}} of nappes in the Northern part of the Alps and part of the Helvetic zone. They consist of Mesozoic limestones, shales and marls that were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> on the {{southern}} continental margin of the European continent. During the Alpine orogeny they were thrusted north over a décollement {{and at the same time}} were internally deformed by folding and thrusting.|$|R
500|$|Some of the {{deposited}} {{chemical species}} may {{interact with the}} ice, so what is detected in an ice core is not necessarily what was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited.</b> [...] Examples include HCHO and [...] [...] Another complication is that in areas with low accumulation rates, deposition from fog can increase the concentration in the snow, sometimes {{to the point where}} the atmospheric concentration could be overestimated by a factor of two.|$|R
60|$|More words {{followed}} these, providing if my {{lady was}} dead, or if Miss Rachel was dead, {{at the time}} of the testator's decease, for the Diamond being sent to Holland, in accordance with the sealed instructions <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> with it. The proceeds of the sale were, in that case, to be added to the money already left by the Will for the professorship of chemistry at the university in the north.|$|R
30|$|Searson and {{coworkers}} used {{the results of}} NiCu dealloying to identify an interesting core/shell structure in the <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> alloy [24]. This structure was subsequently confirmed by spatially resolved composition measurements [25], and the kinetics of the deposition process that facilitates its formation was studied [26]. By combining this core/shell structure with deposition into nanoporous templates and selective dealloying, the fabrication of nickel nanotubes is possible [24, 25, 27].|$|R
50|$|Quick clay is {{typically}} <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> in a marine environment. In that environment, the positive charge of cations (such as sodium) {{was able to}} bind clay particles (negative surface charge) by balancing charge in the double layer. When the clay became uplifted and was no longer subjected to salt water conditions, rainwater infiltrated these clays and washed away the salts that allowed these clay particles to remain in a stable structure.|$|R
50|$|The Helvetic zone, Helvetic {{system or}} the Helveticum is a {{geologic}} subdivision of the Alps. The Helvetic zone crops out mainly in Switzerland, {{hence the name}} (derived from Helveticus: Latin for Swiss). Rocks in the Helvetic zone are sedimentary and were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> at the southern margin of the European plate. The Helvetic zone correlates with the French Dauphinois zone, French geologists often prefer the French name but normally this is considered the same thing.|$|R
50|$|Its origin {{is still}} debated. We {{do know that}} it was {{deposited}} near or on an ancient shore and is a sedimentary rock. However, iron oolites are not being actively deposited anywhere in the world today. It is possible that it was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> as a calcareous oolite and hematite later replaced the calcite. Or it could have been deposited directly as an iron oolite. There is strong evidence for both theories.|$|R
50|$|Petoskey {{stones are}} found in the Gravel Point Formation of the Traverse Group. They are {{fragments}} of a coral reef that was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> during the Devonian period. When dry, the stone resembles ordinary limestone but when wet or polished using lapidary techniques, the distinctive mottled pattern of the six-sided coral fossils emerges. It is sometimes made into decorative objects. Other forms of fossilized coral are also found in the same location.|$|R
5000|$|The Cairn Formation was <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> as limestones and mudstones in {{intertidal}} to subtidal reef environments, and was extensively dolomitized during later diagenesis. It now consists {{primarily of}} buff to dark grey, very fine to medium grained crystalline dolostone with good intercrystalline, biomoldic and vuggy porosity. Most {{of it is}} classified as floatstone, with stromatoporoids and other fossils supported in a dolostone matrix. [...] The Cairn also includes minor amounts of undolomitized limestone and chert.|$|R
25|$|If {{creditors}} (note {{holders of}} gold <b>originally</b> <b>deposited)</b> {{lost faith in}} the ability of a bank to pay their notes, however, many would try to redeem their notes at the same time. If, in response, a bank could not raise enough funds by calling in loans or selling bills, the bank would either go into insolvency or default on its notes. Such a situation is called a bank run and caused the demise of many early banks.|$|R
6000|$|... "For, {{from the}} family evidences, I have met with two MSS. {{on the subject of}} Alchemy, which, from the character, spelling, etc., may almost {{certainly}} be referred to the reign of Henry the Seventh. If these were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> with the MSS. of the Cliffords, it might have been for the use of this nobleman. If they were brought from Bolton at the Dissolution, they must have been the work of those Canons whom he almost exclusively conversed with.|$|R
50|$|At present, the Guadalupe Group in the anticlinals of Zipaquirá and Nemocón {{contains}} rock salt. These halite <b>deposits</b> are not <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> in the Late Cretaceous Guadalupe Group, yet are allochtonous diapirs {{formed when}} the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous normal faults were reactivated as reverse faults during the mayor Miocene tectonic {{movements of the}} Eastern Ranges. The salt had been deposited during the Early Cretaceous (Valanginian-Barremian, approximately 135 to 125 Ma), intruding into the overlying formations of the Upper Cretaceous.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, Viscountess Amberley died of {{diphtheria}} caught {{from her}} daughter, who died five days later. Her death greatly affected her husband, whose {{decision to have}} her body cremated shocked the society. Lady Amberley's remains were <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> in the grounds of their Wye Valley home {{along with those of}} her daughter and no religious ceremony was held. Shortly after her husband's death two years later, all three bodies were moved to the Russell family vault at Chenies.|$|R
50|$|The Lewisian gneiss, {{the oldest}} rocks in Great Britain, date {{from at least}} 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago) in the Archaean eon, the Earth itself being about 4,600 Ma old. They {{are found in the}} far north west of Scotland and in the Hebrides, with a few small {{outcrops}} elsewhere. Formed from rock <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> at the surface of the planet, the rocks were later buried deep in the Earth's crust and metamorphosed into crystalline gneiss.|$|R

50|$|In finance, a dual {{currency}} deposit (DCD, {{also known}} as Dual Currency Instrument or Dual Currency Product) is a derivative instrument which combines a money market deposit with a currency option to provide a higher yield than that available for a standard deposit. There is a higher risk than with the latter - the depositor can receive less funds than <b>originally</b> <b>deposited</b> and in a different currency. So one could do a USD/JPY DCD depositing USD and receive JPY.|$|R
