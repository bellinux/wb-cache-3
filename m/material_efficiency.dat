6000|$|Ah! well! I {{suppose we}} have been too long {{familiar}} with the unprofitableness of speculation, have surrendered too definitely to action--to the material side of things, retaining for what relaxation our spirits may require, a habit of sentimental aspiration, carefully divorced from things as they are. We seem to have decided that things are not, or, if they are, ought not to be--and what is the good of thinking of things like that? In fact, our national ideal has become the Will to Health, to <b>Material</b> <b>Efficiency,</b> and to it we have sacrificed the Will to Sensibility. It {{is a point of}} view. And yet--to the philosophy that craves Perfection, to the spirit that desires the golden mean, and hankers for the serene and balanced seat in the centre of the see-saw, it seems a little pitiful, and constricted; a confession of defeat, a hedging and limitation of the soul. Need we put up with this, must we for ever turn our eyes away from things as they are, stifle our imaginations and our sensibilities, for fear that they should become our masters, and destroy our sanity? This is the eternal question that confronts the artist and the thinker. Because of the inevitable decline after full flowering-point is reached, the inevitable fading of the fire that follows the full flame and glow, are we to recoil from striving to reach the perfect and harmonious climacteric? Better to have loved and lost, I think, than never to have loved at all; better to reach out and grasp the fullest expression of the individual and the national soul, than to keep for ever under the shelter of the wall. I would even think it possible to be sensitive without neurasthenia, to be sympathetic without insanity, to be alive to all the winds that blow without getting influenza. God forbid that our Letters and our Arts should decade into Beardsleyism; but between that and their present [...] "health" [...] there lies full flowering-point, not yet, by a long way, reached.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{results of}} the MATTER project (MATerials Technologies for greenhouse gas Emission Reduction). The goal is to provide more insight into the potentials to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Western Europe through changes {{in the production of}} materials and the use of materials. Under current conditions, approximately one third of the Western European GHG emissions {{can be attributed to the}} production of materials. These emissions can be reduced through "materials strategies", based on changes in the materials use (e. g. options like increased <b>materials</b> <b>efficiency,</b> <b>materials</b> substitution or increased recycling). However, such options compete with options that reduce the emissions in the production of materials itself. Changing materials flows can result in significant secondary benefits, for example financial benefits (because of increased <b>materials</b> <b>efficiency)</b> or other environmental benefits (reduced waste volumes, switch to renewable resources). The consideration of secondary benefits can significantly affect the attractiveness of GHG emission reduction strategies (see e. g. [2] for an analysis of the interaction of strategies aiming for renewable resources and GHG emission reduction). An integrated life cycle approach is required for proper assessment of the various materials options in close conjunction with the energy sector, because reduction strategies influence each others efficiency. For example if the reference electricity production becomes less CO...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{other major}} {{challenges}} in manufacturing include a relatively slow printing speed, a limited product size in printer, product parts assembly management, materials availability and their property limitation. In some 3 DP processes, quality may also pose a challenge. Particularly, {{the cost in}} common 3 DP materials is currently much higher than those from traditional manufacturing, but it holds some competitive advantages due to much higher <b>material</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (Reeves 2008). Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} fashion retailers to make sourcing decisions beyond simply chasing low-cost labor and, instead, evaluating total factor performance across <b>material</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> transportation cost, storage cost, capital, and trade policy. Third, policymaking, such as for 3 DP based products, becomes critical as new approaches are needed to support DDM integration (Sisson and Thompson 2012). For instance, current tariff systems and country of origin standards would be revisited for 3 D printed products that are embedded with patented design using customized materials. Consequently, the follow up concerns would also include how international trade policy will evolve in 3 DP integration. Due to the potentially for intermediary goods to be eliminated, goods-related agreements would be replaced by services-related agreements (Trade regulation 2016). In addition, as new formats of trade approach and new raw materials emerge, many World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will not apply in the absence of cross-border trade (Trade regulation 2016).|$|R
