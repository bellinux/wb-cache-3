Findings: The results revealed variation of the reinforced concrete corrosion process due to the natural climate curing treatment. There was a rapid shift of the trend of the corrosion activity for the specimens that underwent natural climate curing treatment from the fifth month of exposure duration; the corrosion activity in the specimens became higher than the specimens that were cured normal for 28 days in water at the six months of the exposure. The finding was attributed to the high rate of temperature and rainfall fluctuation within the tropical region, which caused massive imbalance in the early stage strength development of the concrete.

WAXD studies revealed unusually ordered hard segment morphology of the moisture cured poly(urethane-urea) and its nanocomposites. Slower soft segment dynamics upon clay addition was evident from concentration dependant broadening of the line widths of the NMR peaks, and decreasing reversible heat capacity changes at soft segment glass transition.

In the standard 4 classes of concrete curing are described. Determination of curing class depends on required level of compressive strength immediately after curing (percentage of required characteristic strength after 28 days). Time of curing depends on rate of strength development and concrete surface temperature. In the standard {{there is a}} lack of information about influence of curing class on concrete durability characteristics. The main condition to obtain durable concrete is proper curing regime. Not cured on improperly cured concrete has weakened surface layer. Extremely faults in curing process could lead to defects visible on the concrete surface. More often defects are latent inside the concrete and could be revealed during exploitation, leading to durability reduction. The main effect is increase of surface layer porosity (reinforcement cover) and decrease of its protective properties and tightness. Consequently worsening of mechanical properties could be observed as well as water-tightness, frost resistance, chemical aggression resistance, carbonation resistance and diffusivity of chloride. The analysis shown in the paper are the result of 3 -yers long investigation conducted by authors, which main goal was to determine appropriateness and way to include durability requirements in designing of curing class according to EN 13670 : 2009. Thawing-freezing resistance, scaling with salts resistance, depth of water penetration under pressure and absorptivity were adopted as the basic durability factors. Concretes with different cement types, different rate of compressive strength development, air-entrained and non-air-entrained were tested.

40|$|Hempel Coatings Company have into {{products}} assortment a {{group of}} paints {{which is based on}} isocyanate pre-polymer resins which cure with moisture forming a coating based on polyurea. These paints are called 1 component polyurethanes (1 K PU) or <b>moisture</b> <b>curing</b> polyurethanes (MCU). The principal function of these paints is the protection of substrates providing durability to the assets. This project was proposed by Protective Coatings R&D Department due to two reasons: - The resins and water scavengers used for 1 K PU are used only for these products so it is really important to have as reduced raw materials stock as possible. In addition these coatings represent {{a small percentage of the}} overall Hempel’s Coatings production. - Recently REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) has included all the products containing MDI isocyanate monomer/oligomer in the risk sentence R 40, limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect, and two 1 K PU coatings existing in Hempel contain this isocyanate. Thus this project was thought to study the isocyanate resins and water scavengers available in Hempel’s raw materials stock to reformulate the existing products. When reformulating the existing products the aim is improve 1 K PU performance, reduce raw materials stock and, if possible, avoid the use of MDI isocyanates. The project planning consists of the reformulation of all the possible alternatives of the existing standard products using the raw materials available. Afterwards the products formulated must be produced by vacuum dissolver in order to avoid the moisture incorporation. Finally these products have to be applied on the panels for the final testing. The main properties that 1 K PU products need to present have been tested and the best combination of isocyanate resins and water scavengers should be found out...|$|E
40|$|Poly(urethanes) (PU) {{can be used}} as healing {{agent to}} heal cracks in {{self-healing}} concrete. Studying the reaction kinetics is however difficult as the PU needs environmental <b>moisture</b> to <b>cure.</b> On the other hand the moisture in the concrete could {{play a role in the}} reactions. To monitor the reactions a technique where environmental moisture can reach the sample in a comparable way as in cracks is needed. The crack width usually is in the order of 50 - 500 ?m. For this purpose dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) with parallel plate geometry was proven to be suited. The PU starts as a viscous mixture but gradually becomes stiffer which is measured via the increase in storage modulus. Differences in reaction kinetics between different types of monomers can be observed in this way. The same methodology will be used to study the effect of the cement matrix on the cure behavior of the PU...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of moisture {{content in the}} environment during manufacture of a novel cobalt-free UP matrix reinforced with flax fibres, on the fibre–matrix adhesion was studied. Flax surface energy was experimentally determined by measuring contact angles on technical fibres, using the Wilhelmy technique and the acid–base theory. The mechanical strength of the interface under different humidity conditions was characterized by the critical local value of interfacial shear stress, τd, {{at the moment of}} crack initiation, which was assessed by single-fibre pull-out tests. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis gave further insight into the topic. The results suggest that the effect of humidity during manufacturing on the composite interface might be limited. However, longitudinal composite strength decreased somewhat for composites produced in humid conditions, showing that there is some detrimental effect of high levels of <b>moisture</b> during <b>cure</b> on the fibre mechanical performance, likely caused by some fibre degradation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to better}} {{understand}} the nature of flax/epoxy hot melt prepreg systems as well as the mechanical properties of their cured composites. Two uncured systems were subjected to thermal gravimetric analysis and compaction experiments. Composites were then produced in an autoclave at pressures of 1, 3 and 5 bars. Void analysis was carried out on the cured laminates by optical microscopy and void contents ranging from below 1 % to over 20 % were obtained by image analysis. The primary source of voids was shown to be resin starvation {{based on the results of}} the compaction tests. Tensile properties were shown to be strongly degraded by fabric crimp. Short beam tests revealed a 16 % decrease in interlaminar shear strength with a 3. 5 % increase in void content. Similarly, water absorption tests showed a significant increase in rate of absorption likely due to the presence of voids. The results suggest that in order for flax/epoxy prepregs to reach their full potential, the level of crimp and the evacuation of <b>moisture</b> during <b>cure</b> should be of primary concern. status: publishe...|$|R
