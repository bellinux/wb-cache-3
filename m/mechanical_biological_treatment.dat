5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E

40|$|The {{politically}} preferred {{solution to}} fulfil legal recycling demands is often implementing separate collection systems. However, experience shows their limitations, particularly in urban centres {{with a high}} population density. In response to the European Union landfill directive, <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> waste <b>treatment</b> plants have been installed all over Europe. This technology {{makes it possible to}} retrieve plastic waste from municipal solid waste. Operators of <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> waste <b>treatment</b> plants, both in Germany and the Netherlands, have started to change their mechanical separation processes to additionally produce plastic pre-concentrates. Results from <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> waste <b>treatment</b> and separate collection of post-consumer packaging waste will be presented and compared. They prove that both the yield and the quality of plastic waste provided as feedstock for the production of secondary plastic raw material are largely comparable. An economic assessment shows which conditions for a technical sorting plant are economically attractive in comparison to separate collection systems. It is, however, unlikely that plastic recycling will ever reach cost neutrality. </p...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to waste reduction and recycling strategies, {{there are various}} alternatives to landfills, including waste-to-energy incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> pyrolysis and plasma arc gasification.

25|$|Alternative {{technologies}} are available or in development such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> anaerobic digestion (MBT/AD), autoclaving or mechanical heat treatment (MHT) using steam or plasma arc gasification (PGP), which is incineration using electrically produced extreme high temperatures, or combinations of these treatments.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{including}} Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, {{have banned}} {{the disposal of}} untreated waste in landfills.

40|$|Pre-treatments of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{are common}} in all {{developed}} countries.

The purpose of this work is to study some geotechnical and biochemical aspects of four final fractions resulting from MBT of MSW, in order to outline waste managing strategies in relation to typology and impact of the pretreatments. After a trade analysis, tests were performed on compressibility, biological stability and leachability of the main contaminants.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{models and}} process {{simulators}} {{can be very}} useful in creation of effective control systems for wastewater treatment processes. They also allow seizing procedures of designing of technological processes, helping to estimate and to pick up successfully technological parameters, which influence stability and efficiency of processes. Modern wastewater treatment is a quite complex process, which includes several treatment steps before the water is released to the recipient. The typical process of wastewater treatment includes four stages: <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> chemical treatment, and sludge treatment. In this paper the separate models for each wastewater treatment stage are combined to form a complex dynamic model for simulation of wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|The use of {{landfills}} for {{the disposal}} of municipal solid waste (MSW) has many technical and regulatory limits. An interesting solution is to recover the bales that have been pre-viously stored in a landfill. After specific <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> (MBT), {{the contents of the}} bales can be used to produce a solid recovered fuel (SRF) {{that can be used for}} energy purposes. The possibility of producing SRF fuels from a landfill in north-ern Italy has been studied and is presented in this paper. The MSW extracted from the landfill, the bio-dried material produced by the waste hypothetically treated in a plant for bio-drying, and the SRF obtained after the extraction of inert materials, metals and glass from the bio-dried material have been characterized. Assessed the waste nature, the potential environmental impact of dioxin release from a possible landfill fire has been analysed, applying the Austal 2000 model syste...|$|R
25|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> (MBT) {{system is}} a type of waste {{processing}} facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as composting or anaerobic digestion. MBT plants are designed to process mixed household waste as well as commercial and industrial wastes.|$|E
25|$|Pressure from {{environmentally}} related {{legislation on}} {{solid waste disposal}} methods in developed countries has increased the application of anaerobic digestion as a process for reducing waste volumes and generating useful byproducts. It may either be used to process the source-separated fraction of municipal waste or alternatively combined with mechanical sorting systems, to process residual mixed municipal waste. These facilities are called <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that <b>mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E

40|$|As {{the quality}} of our lives rises, so do {{quantities}} of municipal solid wastes. Deposition of municipal solid wastes directly on landfills has become an obsolete way to handle wastes. We must recycle and reuse as many wastes as we can, and the volume of deposited wastes has to be decreased. Therefore wastes have to be treated before deposition. Different technologies of pre-treatment of municipal solid wastes are being used. Incineration plants are the most popular, but such plants are not the only effective way to treat wastes. The present work focuses on the plant for <b>mechanical</b> – <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> of municipal solid wastes. In his work I focused on basics and different methods of <b>mechanical</b> – <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> of wastes and the latest work on this field. In this kind of plant wastes are being recycled and used in industry or in production of refuzed derived fuels. The wastes to be landfilled are being treated to reduce their volume and to make them inert. Inert wastes can then be landfilled without reprezenting a threat to environment. I will also present the state of handling with wastes in Ljubljana region of Slovenija. Based on the knowledge in this work I have assessed the posibilities of building this kind of plant Ljubljana region, in wich I focused on economic, ecologic and social views on this issue.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> (MBTs) are {{extensively}} {{used for}} managing {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW). There are four different methods: fertilizer or compost-like output production, biogas/energy production, waste-derived fuel production and disposal in landfills. One issue is the varying characteristics of the waste fed over the lifetime of the plant. This problem is only partially related to the composition dynamics of the generated MSW. Indeed, {{the main source of}} input fluctuation of the plant {{is a result of the}} implementation of selective collection (SC) strategies, which modify the composition of residual MSW (RMSW). Often the SC strategies are not developed in harmony with the presence or planning of treatment plants, which can consequently suffer from significant variations. A lack of optimization in MSW management strategies and the implementation of new more stringent regulations applied to the final solid products from MBTs could result in a higher tariff for the users. This paper analyses these two problems in terms of two SC scenarios. The consequent effects on the composition of RMSW and on the performance of bio-drying (one of the MBTs options) are discussed. The effect of different SC strategies of MSW is analysed also in terms of RMSW suitability to be converted into refuse derived fuel/solid recovered fuel with simplified treatments. The role of respirometry is also discussed...|$|R
