We introduce <b>metric</b> and <b>gauge</b> extensors, pseudo-orthogonal <b>metric</b> extensors, <b>gauge</b> bases, tetrad bases and prove the remarkable golden formula, which permit us to view any Clifford algebra Cl(V,G) as a deformation of the euclidean Clifford algebra Cl(V,G_{E}) discussed in the first paper of the series and to easily perform calculations in Cl(V,G) using Cl(V,G_{E}).

50|$|In the Gallo-Roman era, a {{minor road}} {{connecting}} Delle with Froidefontaine crossed Boron and Vellescot. A {{section of a}} hundred meters length was excavated around 1851. The first mention {{of the name of}} Vellecort is in the charter of equipment of the priory of Froidefontaine on 8 March 1105. The village then formed part of the town hall and the parish of Grosne and returned in 1125 to Frederic, count of Ferrette. In the Austrian period, which lasted {{from the middle of the}} fourteenth to the middle of the sixteenth century, the name of the village was Germanized to Hanendorf.Before the Second World War a <b>metric</b> <b>gauge</b> railroad of local interest ran between Belfort and Réchésy, which crossed Grosne, Vellescot and Suarce.|$|E
50|$|The company Sociedad General de Tranvías Interiores de Valladolid {{was created}} in 1879, headed by Valerio Morales, who {{presents}} a proposal for developing the system. Valladolid City Council invited tenders for building and operating the <b>metric</b> <b>gauge</b> tram network, using animal traction. The mentioned society won the contract in June 1880. Immediately, Eduardo Barral, a Catalan entrepreneur, bought the company. The first line was opened on 22 December 1881. It was a 2.100 metres route starting at railway station. It continued by Acera de Recoletos, Santiago Street, Plaza Mayor, Lencería Street, Platerías Street, Cantarranas Street (current Macías Picavea) and Corredera Street (current Angustias), crossing Plaza de San Pablo {{in order to reach}} the old bullring. Trams depot was located in Plaza de San Pablo, just in the plot now occupied by Zorrilla High School. The service was provided by four coaches and later enlarged with two more. Each coach was moved by two mules. Six years later rails reached the railway station platforms, making the transfer between train and tram easier.|$|E

Our analysis clarifies how different sets of four-dimensional charges can be assigned to a single five-dimensional object under the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Possible choices are related by the Witten effect on dyons and by a large gauge transformation in four and five dimensions, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Above Planck energies, the spacetime {{might become}} non [...] Riemannian, {{as it is}} known fron string theory and inflation. Then {{geometries}} arise in which nonmetricity and torsion appear as field strengths, side by side with curvature. By gauging the affine group, a <b>metric</b> affine <b>gauge</b> theory emerges as dynamical framework. Here, by using the harmonic map ansatz, a new class of multipole like solutions in the metric affine gravity theory (MAG) is obtained. Comment: 13 pages, Revtex, to appear in Phys. Lett. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered Hilbert space description of renormalizable interactions of higher spin (equal or bigger than 1) fields requires {{to replace the}} pointlocal s= 1 vectorpotentials of indefinite metric (Krein space) BRST gauge theory by their stringlike counterpart in Hilbert space. It is shown that the Hilbert space positivity leads to new properties outside the conceptual range of the gauge theoretic description: topological aspects of Wilson loops, induced normalization terms (in particular Mexican hat type potentials for massive vectormesons coupled to Hermitian scalar field) and a possible role of string-localization in confinerment.

40|$|We {{advocate}} {{and develop the}} use of the dreibein (and the metric) as prepotential for three-dimensional SO(3) Yang-Mills theory. Since the dreibein transforms homogeneously under <b>gauge</b> transformation, the <b>metric</b> is <b>gauge</b> invariant. For a generic gauge potential, there is a unique dreibein on fixing the boundary condition. Topologically non-trivial monopole configurations are given by conformally flat metrics, with scalar fields capturing the monopole centres. Our approach also provides an ansatz for the gauge potential covering the topological aspects. Comment: 13 pages, improved version, section on Jacobian remove...|$|R

In this context a parameter arises which represents topological defects induced by an infinite static string along the z axis. Finally, we discuss a simple solution that may be derived from the Kerr ansatz. Comment: 10 pages, version published in Class. Quantum Gra...|$|R
