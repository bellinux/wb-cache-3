40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{shown that the}} shear fields {{on either side of}} the {{westerlies}} are dynamically unstable and will roll up to form discrete eddies. A study of the stable vortex systems into which these eddies might collect shows that a "vortex street" is stable for a certain range of the ratio of width to vortex spacing. It is also shown that a formation with vortices placed on the corners of a regular polygon is stable if the number of vortices is less than seven. This still holds if the effect of the shear field north of the westerlies is stimulated by a fixed polar cyclone. It further appears that with a strong general circulation, i. e. strong westerlies, only two or three high pressure cells should be found while the numbers, up to six, should be found with weaker circulations.

40|$|The {{anomalous}} stratospheric warming of January and February 1957 is {{studied in}} detail by <b>means</b> of constant <b>pressure</b> <b>charts,</b> time sections, and cross sections. The warming occurred as the meandering Arctic stratospheria jet stream of wave number two {{developed into a}} pair of vortices extending to above the 10 -mb. surface. It is concluded that development of stratospheric waves in the Northern Hemisphere is facilitated by autumnal growth of a forced perturbation locked in place by a warm ridge over the Aleutian area. The baroclinicity and rate of development were in agreement with Fleagle's criteria for the growth of disturbances. Interaction between the tropospheric jet stream and Arctic stratospheric jet stream during the period of development is believed responsible for the great intensity of the 1957 warming. 1...|$|R
40|$|Anomalously {{warm and}} cold {{months in the}} Mediterranean basin were {{identified}} during the period 1860 – 1990 from observations at five stations located along the west–east axis of the Mediterranean basin (Barcelona, Florence, Malta, Athens and Jerusalem), supplemented by data from Madrid and Lisbon. Warm months were characterized by thermic indices (TI) based on values of the standardized anomalous temperatures. Different patterns of anomalously warm and cold months were qualitatively identified {{on the basis of}} the spatial distributions of the TIs. The standardized sea-level pressure (SLP) values at 56 grid points in the domain 35 – 65 °N, 30 °W– 40 °E, for each of the anomalously warm and cold months, were subjected to T-mode Principal Component Analysis. The mean TIs associated with each principal component in each season, for both warm and cold months, are arranged in four distinct different spatial distributions: (i) a Mediterranean-wide distribution of positive:negative anomalies; (ii) strong positive:negative anomalies in the west and central Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in the east; (iii) strong positive:negative anomalies in the eastern Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in central and western parts; (iv) strong positive: negative anomalies in the central Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in eastern and western parts. Finally, monthly mean charts of standardized anomaly and <b>mean</b> sea-level <b>pressure</b> <b>charts</b> are constructed for each principal component in each season, and are used to interpret the spatial distribution of the positive and negative temperatur...|$|R

40|$|Strong wind {{events at}} Dumont d'Urville (DdU), an East Antarctic coastal station, and Dome C, an {{interior}} station, were studied {{to determine if}} the wind along the Adelie Land coast increases with the approach of the depression from the west of the site or after its passage to the east of it. The events for the year 1993 were studied using synoptic observations, <b>mean</b> sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>charts</b> and composite infrared satellite images. It was found that the winds are enhanced with the approach of a depression from the west towards the DdU coast. The wind increases in response to the decreasing pressure at the coastal site and increasing downslope pressure difference (dp). The wind starts decreasing once the system moves to the east of DdU and the pressure at DdU starts building up, as reported in some earlier studies. The response of wind to the approaching depression is not the same for all the events but depends on the downslope pressure difference and the movement of the depression that is often conditioned by the presence of a blocking high to the northeast. The wind comes down if the system starts penetrating inland due to the presence of the high pressure ridge to the northeast and decreasing dp. It is observed that the winds at Dome C increase to as high as 17 m s- 1 with the inland penetration of the depression...|$|R

Non-invasive determination of the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient by Doppler ultrasonography is, however, complicated by the squared relation between instantaneous velocities and pressure differences. The validity of a new simple formula for calculation of the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> difference from the peak pressure difference was evaluated in 26 patients with aortic stenosis. The formula is: delta pmean = 0. 64 delta ppeak, where delta pmean is the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient and delta ppeak the peak pressure gradient. There was a close correlation between the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> differences determined by application of the formula to the peak pressure differences measured at catheterisation and the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> differences obtained by planimetry (r = 0. 97, SEE = 4. 7 mm Hg).

40|$|Abstract—The <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the baseline trend of physiological pressure signals that excludes fluctuations due to the cardiac cycle and, in some cases, the respiratory cycle. In many clinical applications and bedside monitoring devices, the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> is estimated with a 3 – 8 s moving average. We suggest that the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> is best defined in terms of its frequency domain properties. This definition makes it possible to determine solutions that are both optimal and practical. We demonstrate that established methods of optimal finite impulse response (FIR) filter design produce estimates of the <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> that are significantly more accurate than the moving average. These filters have no more computational cost, are less sensitive to artifact, have shorter delays, and greater sensitivity to acute events.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although current {{guidelines}} rest {{exclusively on}} the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the arterial pressure wave is more precisely described as consisting of a pulsatile (pulse pressure) and a steady (<b>mean</b> <b>pressure)</b> component. This study explored the independent roles of pulse <b>pressure</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> as predictors of mortality {{in a wide range}} of patients with hypertension. DESIGN AND METHODS: This meta-analysis, based on individual patient data, has combined results from the control groups of seven randomized clinical trials conducted in patients with systolo-diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. The relative hazard rates associated with pulse <b>pressure</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> were calculated using Cox's proportional hazard regression models with stratification for the seven trials and with adjustment for sex, age, smoking and the other pressure. RESULTS: A 10 mmHg wider pulse pressure at baseline, which corresponds to approximately one-half of its standard deviation, was independently associated with an increase in risk by 6 % for total mortality (P = 0. 001), 7 % for cardiovascular mortality (P = 0. 01), and 7 % for fatal coronary accidents (P = 0. 03). The corresponding increase in risk of fatal stroke was similar (+ 6 %, P = 0. 27) but there were too few strokes to reach statistical significance. In similar analyses, <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> was not identified as an independent predictor of these outcomes. Significant interactions of pulse <b>pressure</b> or <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> with age suggested that the prognostic power of pulse pressure for fatal stroke was more important at higher age (P = 0. 04), whereas the prognostic power of <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> for coronary mortality was greatest in the young (P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive patients pulse <b>pressure,</b> not <b>mean</b> <b>pressure,</b> is associated with an increased risk of fatal events.

40|$|The {{effort to}} model sand {{behavior}} {{within the framework}} of critical-state soil mechanics would benefit from a state variable that relates the current void ratio and <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> of the soil to its void ratio and <b>mean</b> <b>pressure</b> at the critical state.

Using this state pressure index, a bounding surface hypoplasticity model for sand is modified so that the phase transformation and failure stress ratios both depend on I-p and merge into the critical-state stress ratio at failure. The I-p dependency introduced enables use of a single set of model constants in modeling sand behavior for various initial confining pressures and densities under both undrained and drained conditions. Dilatancy, strain softening, and strain hardening are simulated for both loose and dense sands.
