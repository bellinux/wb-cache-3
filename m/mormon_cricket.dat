50|$|The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket,</b> {{actually}} a katydid {{and member of}} this subfamily, {{has been known to}} cause extensive damage when it breeds in large numbers in cropland.|$|E
50|$|Although flightless, the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> {{is capable}} of {{traveling}} up to two kilometers a day in its swarming phase, during which {{it is a serious}} agricultural pest and traffic hazard.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Two feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the protein quality of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> (Anabrus simplex Haldeman) when fed to broiler chicks. The first trial was designed to identify the limiting amino acids in <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> using purified diets. The basal diet was sup-plemented with amino acids based on an amino acid analysis of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> and preliminary feeding trials, and {{the results indicated that}} methionine and arginine were probably colimiting. In the second experiment <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> were incorporated into practical diets replacing soy-bean meal as the major source of protein. In an 8 -week feeding trial the corn-cricket diet compared favorably with a corn-soybean meal diet with no significant differences in weight gain or feed/gain ratios. There was no adverse effect on the taste of the meat from birds fed the corn-cricket diet as determined by a taste panel. (Key words: crickets, protein feedstuffs, protein quality...|$|R
40|$|Disturbance {{events can}} {{significantly}} influence net CO 2 exchange (NCE) in ecosystems. High densities of Anabrus simplex (<b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets)</b> periodically afflict {{large areas of}} the western USA; their sheer numbers could make them a significant source of CO 2. We modeled cricket respiration at the ecosystem level using air and body temperatures and insect gas exchange measurements. Cricket CO 2 efflux values were compared to ecosystem CO 2 flux from eddy covariance measurements in 3 Great Basin ecosystems: a juniper woodland, a sagebrush shrubland, and a crested wheatgrass pasture. Mean respiration from <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> was 0. 96 g CO 2 ⋅ m– 2 d– 1. Since <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> are present when NCE is otherwise near 0, they can potentially alter NCE between 20 % (juniper woodland) and 60 % (crested wheatgrass pasture). Transient pests such as <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> can be an important component of NCE...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> (Anabrus simplex) {{is a large}} insect {{that can}} grow to almost 3 in in length. It lives {{throughout}} western North America in rangelands dominated by sagebrush and forbs.|$|E
50|$|Despite its name, the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> is {{actually}} a shieldbacked katydid, not a cricket. It {{takes its name from}} Mormon settlers in Utah, who encountered them while pushing westward, and for the prominent role they play in the miracle of the gulls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> eggs hatch {{mostly in}} the spring after they are laid, {{although}} in some areas eggs may take {{as many as five}} years to hatch. Hatching begins when soil temperatures reach 40 F. The nymphs pass through seven instars before reaching the adult stage, typically taking 60 to 90 days.|$|E
50|$|During an {{infestation}} <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> {{can cause}} significant damage to crops and gardens.|$|R
50|$|Research {{published}} in 2006 shows that <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> move in these migratory bands, firstly {{to find new}} sources of the critical nutrients of protein and salt, and secondly to avoid being eaten by hungry crickets approaching from the rear. The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket's</b> cannibalistic behavior may lead to swarm behavior because crickets may need to move constantly forward to avoid attacks from behind.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the state}} bird of Utah, remembered for {{assisting}} Mormon settlers in dealing with a plague of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets.</b> A monument in Salt Lake City commemorates this event, known as the [...] "Miracle of the Gulls".|$|R
50|$|Mormon crickets are preyed upon by a {{wide variety}} of birds and mammals. These predators include California gulls, crows, coyotes and various rodents. There are no predators that {{specialize}} on Mormon crickets, which may be explained by the cricket's migratory habits and large population fluctuations. Gordius robustus, a species of horsehair worm, is a parasite of the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket,</b> as is Ooencyrtus anabrivorus.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> shows {{a marked}} {{preference}} for forbs, but grasses and shrubs such as sagebrush are also consumed. [...] Mormon crickets also eat insects, including other Mormon crickets (especially individuals {{that have been}} killed or injured by automobiles or insecticides). Cannibalistic behavior may {{be a result of}} protein and salt deficiency; swarming behavior may in turn be a strategy to avoid predation by other Mormon crickets.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> {{exists in}} populations of {{relatively}} low density {{throughout most of}} its range. At certain times and places, however, population explosions or infestations occur in which large numbers of the crickets form roving bands. These bands may include millions of individuals and be found with densities of up to 100 individuals per square meter. These infestations may last years or even decades, and are characterized by a gradual increase and then decrease in population. The factors that trigger these infestations are poorly understood, but {{are thought to be}} weather-related.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> may undergo {{morphological}} changes {{triggered by}} high population densities, {{similar to those}} seen in locusts. The most noticeable change is in coloration: solitary individuals typically have green or purple coloration, while swarming individuals are often black, brown or red.|$|R
50|$|As <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> are flightless, {{physical}} barriers may be effective. Barriers {{should be}} at least two feet high and made of a smooth material. Residents of some small towns have used boom boxes and sound systems playing hard rock music in attempts to divert the moving swarms away from crops and houses.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method for}} the control of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> {{is the use of}} a {{biopesticide}} based on the fungus Nosema locustae. N. locustae is a naturally occurring microbe the spores of which kill orthopterans by interfering with the digestive system. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its use has no adverse effect on humans or the environment.|$|R
50|$|For {{many species}} the only type of male {{investment}} received {{is that of}} sex cells. In those terms, the female investment greatly exceeds that of male investment as previously mentioned. However, {{there are other ways}} in which males invest in their offspring. For example, the male can find food as in the example of balloon flies. He may find a safe environment for the female to feed or lay her eggs as exemplified in many birds. He may also protect the young and provide them with opportunities to learn as in many young as in wolves. Overall, the main role that males overtake is that of protection of the female and their young. That often can decrease the discrepancy of investment caused by the initial investment of sex cells. And indeed there are some species such as the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket,</b> pipefish seahorse and Panamanian poison arrow frog males invest more. What is interesting is that among the species where the male invests more, the male is also the pickier sex placing higher demands on their selected female. For example, the female that they often choose usually contain 60% more eggs than rejected females. This links Parental Investment Theory (PIT) with sexual selection: where parental investment is bigger for a male than a female, it's usually the female who competes for a mate, as shown by Phalaropidae and polyandrous bird species. In these species females are usually more aggressive, brightly coloured, and larger than males, suggesting the more investing sex has more choice while selecting a mate compared to the sex engaged in intra-sexual selection.|$|E
40|$|The gut {{microbiome}} {{of insects}} {{plays an important}} role in their ecology and evolution, participating in nutrient acquisition, immunity, and behavior. Microbial community structure within the gut is heavily influenced by differences among gut regions in morphology and physiology, which determine the niches available for microbes to colonize. We present a high-resolution analysis of the structure of the gut microbiome in the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> Anabrus simplex, an insect known for its periodic outbreaks in the western United States and nutrition-dependent mating system. The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> microbiome was dominated by 11 taxa from the Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae. While most of these were represented in all gut regions, there were marked differences in their relative abundance, with lactic-acid bacteria (Lactobacillaceae) more common in the foregut and midgut and enteric (Enterobacteriaceae) bacteria more common in the hindgut. Differences in community structure were driven by variation in the relative prevalence of three groups: a Lactobacillus in the foregut, Pediococcus lactic-acid bacteria in the midgut, and Pantoea agglomerans, an enteric bacterium, in the hindgut. These taxa have been shown to have beneficial effects on their hosts in insects and other animals by improving nutrition, increasing resistance to pathogens, and modulating social behavior. Using PICRUSt to predict gene content from our 16 S rRNA sequences, we found enzymes that participate in carbohydrate metabolism and pathogen defense in other orthopterans. These were predominately represented in the hindgut and midgut, the most important sites for nutrition and pathogen defense. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences from cultured isolates indicated low levels of divergence from sequences derived from plants and other insects, suggesting that these bacteria are likely to be exchanged between Mormon crickets and the environment. Our study shows strong spatial variation in microbiome community structure, which influences predicted gene content and thus the potential of the microbiome to influence host function...|$|E
40|$|Beauveria bassiana (Fungi: Ascomycota) is an entomopathogenic fungus {{that serves}} as a {{biological}} control agent of Mormon crickets Anabrus simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) and other grasshopper pests. To measure the dose-dependent response of Mormon crickets to fungal attack, we applied B. bassiana strain GHA topically to adults using doses of 5. 13 [*]×[*] 104 to 1. 75 [*]×[*] 106 conidia in sunflower oil, with oil only as a control. After three weeks, we assessed the survivors' hemolymph for fungal cells, active phenoloxidase (PO), and lysozyme. Mortality increased and body mass of survivors decreased with conidial dose. survivors' PO activity was elevated to the same level independent of dose. Those with fungal cells visible in their hemolymph did not differ in PO activity from those with clear hemolymph. We conclude that circulating PO may be an important enzymatic defense against Beauveria infection and that it is associated with attempted clearing of Beauveria blastospores and hyphae from <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> hemolymph...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> have {{variable}} coloration. The overall color may be black, brown, red, purple or green. The [...] "shield" [...] (pronotum {{or modified}} prothorax that covers vestigial wings) behind the head may have colored markings. The abdomen {{may appear to}} be striped. Females have a long ovipositor, which should not be mistaken for a stinger. Both sexes have long antennae.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} control method used is carbaryl (typically sold as [...] "Sevin Dust") bait. This bait kills both the <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> that eat the bait, and the crickets that eat crickets that ate the bait. Insecticides applied directly to crops may kill the insects, {{but due to}} the large size of swarms, this method usually does not save the crop from being destroyed.|$|R
25|$|Large {{invertebrates}} include tarantulas (Aphonopelma genus) and <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets.</b> Exotic species, including chukar, grey partridge, and Himalayan snowcock, {{have been}} successfully introduced to the Great Basin, although the latter has only thrived in the Ruby Mountains. Cheatgrass, an invasive species which was unintentionally introduced, forms a critical portion of their diets. Feral horses (mustangs) and wild burros are other highly reproductive, and ecosystem-controversial, alien species. Most of the Great Basin is open range and domestic cattle and sheep are widespread.|$|R
40|$|Cannibalism {{is common}} among the Acrididae and the <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket,</b> Anabrus simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). This {{behavior}} {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism for the horizontal transmission of Microsporida and entomopathogenic fungi. Aanecdotal observations suggested that the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes Fabricius (Acrididae), and A. simplex did not eat cadavers that {{had been killed by}} insect pathogenic fungi. The hypothesis tested was that A. simplex or M. sanguinipes would not cannibalize individuals freshly killed by the entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana Bals. -Criv. (Vuill.) (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), or Metarhizium acridum (Driver and Milner) Bischoff, Rehner, and Humber. Cannibalism was examined in a series of no-choice tests with individual insects. Test insects included healthy adults of M. sanguinipes; the differential grasshopper, M. differentialis (Thomas); the American grasshopper, Schistocerca americana (Drury) (Acrididae); and A. simplex. Individual, starved Acrididae or A. simplex were confined in small cages with either a fungus-killed (but unsporulated) or uninfected cadaver. The insects were then observed periodically for the first 4 hr. After 24 hr, the cadavers were scored for the degree to which the...|$|E
40|$|Research {{investigating}} the geographical context of speciation has primarily focused on abiotic {{factors such as}} the role of Pleistocene glacial cycles, or geotectonic events. Few study systems allow a direct comparison of how biological differences, such as dispersal beha-viour, affect population genetic structure of organisms that were subdivided during the Pleistocene. Mormon crickets exist in solitary and gregarious ‘phases’, which broadly correspond with an east–west mtDNA division across the Rocky Mountains. Gregarious individuals form bands that can move up to 2 km daily. This study assessed whether population genetic structure results mainly from deep Pleistocene vicariance or if we can also detect more recent genetic patterns due to phase and dispersal differences superim-posed on the older, deeper divisions. We found that separation in refugia was a more important influence on genetic divergence than phase, with the Rockies acting as a barrier that separated <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> populations into eastern and western refugia during Pleis-tocene glacial cycles. However, patterns of isolation by distance differ between eastern and western clades for both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, with greater divergence withi...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> (MC) is an {{important}} pest in the western United States. This study evaluated the virulence in the laboratory of 32 isolates of Metarhizium spp. towards field-collected MCs. Additionally, four isolates were tested in outdoor field-cage studies. All 32 Metarhizium isolates were pathogenic towards the MC (could induce some mortality in the laboratory), including four isolates of the grasshopper-specialist species M. acridum. Virulence varied considerably among the isolates. Field studies, conducted in 2008 – 2009, showed a statistically significant effect of fungal treatments in both years. Pairwise comparison of the survival curves, however, revealed that, in 2008, three of the isolates did not differ statistically from the non-fungus control treatment. In 2009, {{all three of the}} isolates tested had significantly lower survival rates than the control treatment: MCs exposed to M. robertsii isolate DWR 346 had the lowest survival with a LT 50 of 16 days. We hypothesize that the poor field performance resulted from a combination of negative environmental effects and isolate selection, and propose that further field studies with additional isolates are needed to identify an efficacious fungal agent for MC biocontrol...|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1850s Red Butte Canyon was {{considered}} {{as a source of}} red sandstone to construct the LDS Salt Lake Temple. A wooden railroad was considered to transport the sandstone to the temple site, but the idea was abandoned in 1855, when it was decided to construct the Temple with granite located in Little Cottonwood Canyon. A monument constructed along the creek in the city’s Yalecrest neighborhood commemorates Salt Lake’s early pioneers drowning sacks of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> in the creek during that era’s notable infestation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1848 the Mormon pioneers planted crops {{for their}} first spring season in Utah. As the crops ripened, <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> descended upon the farms from the foothills east of the valley. The insects {{consumed}} entire fields. According to traditional account, the harvest was saved by flocks of native seagulls which devoured the crickets. This event, popularly called the [...] "Miracle of the Gulls", is remembered by Latter-day Saints as a miracle. The incident is somewhat controversial in nature with some historians questioning {{the credibility of the}} account.|$|R
40|$|Cannibalism {{has been}} shown to be {{important}} to the collective motion of mass migratory bands of insects, such as locusts and <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets.</b> These mobile groups consist of millions of individuals and are highly destructive to vegetation. Individuals move in response to attacks from approaching conspecifics and bite those ahead, resulting in further movement and encounters with others. Despite the importance of cannibalism, the way in which individuals make attack decisions and how the social context affects these cannibalistic interactions is unknown. This can be understood by examining the decisions made by individuals in response to others. We performed a field investigation which shows that adult <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> were more likely to approach and attack a stationary cricket that was side-on to the flow than either head- or abdomen-on, suggesting that individuals could reduce their risk of an attack by aligning with neighbours. We found strong social effects on cannibalistic behaviour: encounters lasted longer, were more likely to result in an attack, and attacks were more likely to be successful if other individuals were present around a stationary individual. This local aggregation appears to be driven by positive feedback whereby the presence of individuals attracts others, which can lead to further crowding. This work improves our understanding of the local social dynamics driving migratory band formation, maintenance an...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Fate and Effects Division has {{revised the}} Environmental Fate and Ecological Risk Assessment chapter {{in support of}} the reregistration {{eligibility}} decision on carbaryl. The chapter has been revised to incorporate recently received fate and effects data and to reflect comments received during the public comment phase of the review process. The revised chapter is attached and contains more detailed information on drinking water monitoring studies and specialized uses of carbaryl, i. e., Section 24 c use of carbaryl to control burrowing shrimp and the use of carbaryl for the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s grasshopper and <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> suppression program. In general, carbaryl is not likely to persist in the environmental; however owing to its mobility and it extensive use, the chemical is frequently detected in surface water and to a much lesser extent in groundwater. Urban use of carbaryl appears to serve as a primary source of carbaryl residues in surface water. Carbaryl’s primary degradate, 1 -naphthol, is expected to degrade more rapidly and be less mobile than the parent. Since 1 -naphthol has many natural and anthropogenic sources other than carbaryl degradation, the presence of this compound cannot be used as a measure of carbaryl use. Furthermore, the Agency does not have soil photolysis (Guideline § 161 - 3) data an...|$|E
40|$|Living in the Great Basin {{requires}} that residents deal with many different natural {{events such as}} range fires, flash flooding, and insect infestations. Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex) have been a problem historically and {{over the last few}} years. The purpose of this fact sheet is to provide residents with pertinent information about Mormon crickets, their life cycle, and a variety of control measures that may reduce damages to their property. Mormon crickets are flightless, ground-dwelling insects native to the western United States. They eat native, herbaceous perennials (forbs), grasses, shrubs, and cultivated forage crops, reducing feed for grazing wildlife and livestock. In large numbers, their feeding can contribute to soil erosion, poor water quality, nutrient depleted soils, and potentially cause damage to range and cropland ecosystems. Drought encourages <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket</b> outbreaks, which may last several years (historically 5 to 21 years) and cause substantial economic losses to rangeland, cropland, and home gardens. This is particularly true as adults and nymphs of Mormon crickets migrate in a band, eating plants along their path. Mormon crickets occur in rangelands west of the Missouri River and statewide in Nevada. Their populations are cyclic over many years. Since the late 1990 s, their population has been increasing, particularly in Nevada (Figure 1). The greatest numbers occupy lands north of Tonopah, Nevada. In 2006, approximately ten million acres in Nevada were infested wit...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} sprays {{used against}} rangeland grasshoppers {{today and the}} current cooperative rangeland grasshopper management program are both results of an evolving solution to an age-old problem. That problem is one of how best to control or suppress damaging populations of grasshoppers over widespread areas. The following chapter will review the history and evolution of chemical sprays in rangeland grasshopper control to the present day. History In the United States, the history of grasshopper control is interwoven {{with that of the}} <b>Mormon</b> <b>cricket.</b> Control was conducted primarily to protect crops, but rangeland also was treated to save forage and prevent insect migration to nearby cropland. During {{the first half of the}} 20 th cen-tury, control relied almost exclusively on poison baits. Although sprays such as paris green and sodium arsenate were used, these compounds fell from favor because the poisoned vegetation endangered livestock (Parker 1952). Both State and Federal assistance were provided for orga-nizing and financing control efforts, particularly during outbreak years. In the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s, several major devel-opments occurred that significantly changed the way grasshoppers were controlled. 1. Perhaps the most important was the development of the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. They were extremely effective in small amounts against grasshop-pers. They could easily be formulated into baits, acted quickly, and had a longer residual effect than previously used baits. Because of these qualities, chlordane and toxaphene in 1949 and aldrin in 1951 quickly replaced previous baits (Parker 1952). 2. Large-scale (thousands of acres) aerial application of bait became more commonplace. Compared to older wet baits, the new compounds could be formulated dry, which made distribution easier. In Montana and Wyoming during 1949 – 50, aerial application of chlor-dane and toxaphene baits were the major tools used against grasshoppers (Parker 1952). 3. Sprays of these compounds were also developed at the same time. In addition to being extremely effective, they were much cheaper than baits. Sprays of chlordane, tox-aphene, and aldrin first were used in grasshopper control programs in 1947, 1948, and 1950, respectively (Parke...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{acoustic}} species, traits such as male calling song {{are likely}} to diverge quickly between allopatric populations due to sexual selection, and divergence in parameters such as carrier frequency, chirp structure, and other important song characters can influence sexual isolation. Here we make use of two forms of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> to examine differences in a broad suite of traits that {{have the potential to}} influence speciation via sexual isolation. <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> in "gregarious" populations aggregate into dense migratory bands, and females are the sexually competitive sex (sex-role reversal). There is also a non-outbreak "solitary" form. These two forms are largely but not perfectly correlated with a significant mtDNA subdivision within the species that is thought to have arisen in allopatry. Combined information about multiple, independently evolving traits, such as morphology and structural and behavioural differences in calling song, provides greater resolution of the overall differences between these allopatric populations, and allows us to assess their stage of divergence. We test two predictions, first that the forms differ in song and second that gregarious males are more reluctant to sing than solitary males due to sex role reversal. We also tested for a difference in the relationship between the size of the forewing resonator, the mirror, and carrier frequency, as most models of sound production in crickets indicate that mirror size should predict carrier frequency. Results Multivariate analyses showed that solitary and gregarious individuals from different populations representing the two mtDNA clades had almost non-overlapping distributions based on multiple song and morphological measurements. Carrier frequency differed between the two, and gregarious males were more reluctant to sing overall. Mirror size predicted carrier frequency; however, the relationship between mirror size and surface area varied between solitary and gregarious forms, suggesting that factors above and beyond mirror size contribute to carrier frequency. Conclusion The two clades of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> differ in a broad suite of independent traits that probably justify subspecies status (the two can successfully mate so may not be reproductively isolated). However, our results emphasize the importance of carefully distinguishing the ultimate causation of differences between traits used to delineate species or subspecies boundaries. </p...|$|R

40|$|Phase polyphenisms {{are usually}} thought to reflect plastic {{responses}} of species, independent of genetic differences; however, phase differences could correlate with genetic differentiation for various reasons. <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> appear {{to occur in}} two phases that differ in morphology and behaviour. Solitary individuals are cryptic and sedentary whereas gregarious individuals form bands, migrate, and are aposematically coloured. These traits have been thought to be phenotypically plastic and induced by environmental conditions. However, {{there has been no}} previous investiga-tion of the extent of genetic differences between solitary and gregarious populations of this widespread North American species. We sequenced two mitochondrial genes, COII and COIII, in samples of <b>Mormon</b> <b>crickets</b> from gregarious populations west of the continental divide and solitary mountain populations primarily east of the divide. Sequen-cing revealed two genetically distinct clades that broadly correspond with the solitary eastern populations and the mainly gregarious western populations. We used coalescent modelling to test the hypothesis that the species consists of two deep genetic clades, as opposed to a series of equally distinct populations. Results allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that a radiation independent of phase produced these clades, and molecular clock estimates indicate the time of divergence to be approximately 2 million years ago. This work establishes that the solitary populations found in the mountains on the eastern slope are part of a clade that is genetically distinct from the western populations, which are primarily gregarious, and the implications of this apparent correlation between phase and genetic differentiation are discussed.
