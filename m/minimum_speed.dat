25|$|After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was {{completed}} {{in time for the}} 2011 race, the start of the track was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a <b>minimum</b> <b>speed</b> of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a <b>minimum</b> <b>speed</b> of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a <b>minimum</b> <b>speed</b> of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start-finish straight.|$|E

50|$|Aviation {{regulations}} (such as FAR and EASA) define {{several different}} VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls {{of the aircraft}} to comply with these regulations. The <b>minimum</b> control <b>speed</b> in the air (VMCA) {{is the most important}} <b>minimum</b> control <b>speed</b> of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and aircraft flight manuals. On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722 kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23. Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific <b>minimum</b> control <b>speeds,</b> as VMC will change depending on the stage of flight.

25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a <b>minimum</b> <b>speed.</b> For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E
25|$|For example, some {{theoretical}} planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha CentauriA (so {{that the}} star appears roughly {{as bright as}} the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha CentauriB orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) a), the planet's own orbital period. Added to {{this would be the}} changing apparent position of Alpha CentauriB during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha CentauriA. (The average speed, at 4.5 degrees per Earth year, is comparable in speed to Uranus here. With the eccentricity of the orbit, the maximum speed near periapse, about 18 degrees per Earth year, is faster than Saturn, but slower than Jupiter. The <b>minimum</b> <b>speed</b> near apoapse, about 1.8 degrees per Earth year, is slower than Neptune.) Depending on its and the planet's position on their respective orbits, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual apparent magnitudes are much dimmer than the apparent magnitude of the Sun as viewed from the Earth (−26.7). The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha CentauriB would appear, on a linear scale, 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha CentauriA (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from the Earth (−12.5).|$|E
