40|$|The {{paradigm}} of the enchanted global economy and the moral perils of involvement with foreign commodities suggests that anxieties about the generally immoral powers believed to exist within foreign objects result from an imperfect understanding of the global marketplace. However, urban Pentecostalists in Accra, Ghana, who are deeply engaged in the global economy, do not fear the moral dangers of commodities as such and do not lack an understanding of modern global capitalism. Ambiguities do arise when commodities are turned into gifts. Gifts carry sentiments, messages and intentions, and the obligation to give or to receive them may contain dangers. In dealing with this dilemma, Pentecostalism creates a space where free gifts can be given without <b>material</b> <b>reciprocity,</b> where commodities can be personalized without invoking evil powers, where its members can be delivered from the powers that emanate from the 'fie', the "house" or "shrine" of an ancestral deity, conveyed by gifts that cannot be refused, and where gifts may signal {{the purity of the}} giver's heart and soul. This multilayered gift-ideology and gift-economy enables Ghanaian Pentecostalism to occupy a pivotal position between the global economy and its own transational and transcultural relations, on the one hand, and local cultural structures dominated by gifts and reciprocal relations, on the other.

They facilitate information dissemination, discussion, and joint activity pertaining to municipal government, public schools, civic groups, local events, community issues and concerns, commerce and economic development, and social services. Community networking is not a new idea. In the United States, its roots are in 1970 s community activism—jobs, housing, and veterans ’ issues in the Berkeley Community Our research and thinking about community computing are supported by the U.

50|$|For most {{photographic}} <b>materials,</b> <b>reciprocity</b> {{is valid}} with good accuracy over {{a range of}} values of exposure duration, but becomes increasingly inaccurate as we depart from this range: this is reciprocity failure (reciprocity law failure, or the Schwarzschild effect). As the light level decreases out of the reciprocity range, the increase in duration, and hence of total exposure, required to produce an equivalent response becomes higher than the formula states; for instance, at half of the light required for a normal exposure, the duration must be more than doubled for the same result. Multipliers used to correct for this effect are called reciprocity factors (see model below).|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{predicted}} and observed that {{radiative heat transfer}} between two surfaces separated by nanometer scale gaps can exceed the flux exchanged between two black bodies [1]. This {{is often referred to}} as superplanckian flux. This raises the question of the possibility of super-planckian emitters into the far field. As many infrared sources are thermal sources, super-planckian emitters would be of practical interest. It has been shown [2, 3] that the power radiated by a finite size emitter can be increased by a factor n 2 by bringing a solid immersion lens in contact with the emitter. This observation does not exceed the planckian prediction. There have been publications suggesting that photonic crystals or metamaterials could achieve super-planckian emission[4, 5]. In this contribution, we report a general proof of the Kirchhoff law. As a consequence, it appears that the emitted flux is the product of the absorption cross section by the black body radiance for any source of arbitrary size made of <b>materials</b> satisfying <b>reciprocity.</b> This result encompass most photonic crystals and metamaterials. It follows that superplanckian emission in the far field is not possible. The expression of the emission can be extended to anisothermal bodies. Indeed, we introduce a local emissivity density which is equal to the local absorptivity. This result had been derived for periodic one dimensional systems previously. Here, we introduce a general derivation valid for any shape and any combination of reciprocal materials...|$|R

Ethnographic insights into <b>material</b> expressions of <b>reciprocity,</b> i. e. of migrants' involvement in personal relations and social networks achieved or proved through objects, can open up new avenues of understanding and create new conceptual lenses in studies of migration.

60|$|A strict {{similarity}} of characters is not necessary, or perhaps very favourable, to friendship. To render it complete, each party must {{no doubt be}} competent to understand the other; both must be possessed of dispositions kindred in their great lineaments: but the pleasure of comparing our ideas and emotions is heightened, when there is 'likeness in unlikeness.' The same sentiments, different opinions, Rousseau conceives {{to be the best}} <b>material</b> of friendship: <b>reciprocity</b> of kind words and actions is more effectual than all. Luther loved Melancthon; Johnson was not more the friend of Edmund Burke than of poor old Dr. Levitt. Goethe and Schiller met again; as they ultimately came to live together, and to see each other oftener, they liked each other better; they became associates, friends; and the harmony of their intercourse, strengthened by many subsequent communities of object, was never interrupted, till death put an end to it. Goethe, in his time, has done many glorious things; but few on which he should look back with greater pleasure than his treatment of Schiller. Literary friendships are said to be precarious, and of rare occurrence: the rivalry of interest disturbs their continuance; a rivalry greater, where the subject of competition is one so vague, impalpable and fluctuating, as the favour of the public; where the feeling to be gratified is one so nearly allied to vanity, the most irritable, arid and selfish feeling of the human heart. Had Goethe's prime motive been the love of fame, he must have viewed with repugnance, not the misdirection but the talents of the rising genius, advancing with such rapid strides to dispute with him the palm of intellectual primacy, nay as the million thought, already in possession of it; and if a sense of his own dignity had withheld him from offering obstructions, or uttering any whisper of discontent, there is none but a truly patrician spirit that would cordially have offered aid. To being secretly hostile and openly indifferent, the next resource was to enact the patron; to solace vanity, by helping the rival whom he could not hinder, and who could do without his help. Goethe adopted neither of these plans. It reflects much credit on him that he acted as he did. Eager to forward Schiller's views by exerting all the influence within his power, he succeeded in effecting this; and what was still more difficult, in suffering the character of benefactor to merge in that of equal. They became not friends only, but fellow-labourers: a connection productive of important consequences in the history of both, particularly of the younger and more undirected of the two.|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{radiometry}} {{can provide}} a non-invasive, non-destructive and inherently safe method of temperature measurement suitable {{for a range of}} medical and industrial applications. The measured radiometric signal is formed by a convolution of the actual material temperature distribution with a coupling spatial response, or weighting function, over the viewed volume of material. The form of this weighting function depends on both the electromagnetic coupling structure (either antenna or cavity) and on the geometry and dielectric properties of the <b>material.</b> Through <b>reciprocity,</b> the weighting function can be found by computation or measurement of the power dissipation distribution (also known as the specific absorption rate (SAR)) when the coupling structure is actively excited. Knowledge of the weighting function is used to interpret the measured radiometric temperature. Chapter 1 introduces the method of microwave radiometry, its range of applications and considers the key features of weighting function determination. The suitability and validity of finite difference time domain (FDTD) SAR and weighting function modelling was investigated for the largely travelling - wave fields appropriate to surface contact antennas. An FDTD simulator, the Basic Electromagnetic Simulation Tool [3], was used to computationally model a range of antenna configurations that could then be compared directly with experimental results. Chapter 2 introduces several numerical techniques and justifies the choice of FDTD modelling. An introduction to the theory of the FDTD technique and a description of the BEST software is also given. Simulations of systems where electromagnetic field distributions are known (or can be determined experimentally) allowed the direct comparison of simulation results with theoretical predictions. Chapters 3 and 4 consider various validation examples; a monopole radiator above ground plane and TEOl waveguide in chapter 3, experimental field determination in lossy dielectrics using the non-resonant perturbation method in chapter 4. In all cases considered, simulation and experiment agree within a reasonable magnitude of error. With the successful validation of its microwave modeling capabilities, the BEST program was then used to predict the weighting functions expected for practical radiometer antennas for microwave temperature measurement. Of primary importance are the variations of the effective coupling distance into the viewed material with dielectric changes, particularly those due to water content, and with measurement frequency. Knowledge of this behaviour is essential for estimating, at one extreme, relatively small but physiologically important temperature gradients within the human body, and at the other extreme, the large and rapidly varying temperature patterns induced during industrial processes. By measuring the microwave temperature at different microwave frequencies, it is possible to retrieve information on the temperature at varying depths within the material. To aid in the interpretation of these measurements, the BEST program was used to ascertain the form of the weighting function at two frequencies, 1. 35 GHz and 3. 2 GHz, for a specific dual - frequency antenna in a range of phantom materials. The phantom materials were composed of a mixture of water, protein and salts, with the intention being to simulate common biological materials. To consider foodstuffs a mashed potato phantom was used. Chapter 5 includes the design of this dual frequency antenna and its application to measuring the radiometric temperature of non-isothermal mashed potato mixtures. The specific manipulation of the potato mixture (through heating and cooling) to produce known temperature profiles (quasi-linear and quasi-quadratic) is also considered in this chapter. Further validation of the BEST weighting function determination is possible by comparison with these experimental temperature measurements. Chapter 6 initially covers the modelling of the dielectric properties of the mashed potato and protein / saline mixtures. In particular, a model of the variation of the dielectric constant and loss factor of the mashed potato material, covering a wide range of temperatures at 1. 35 GHz and 3. 2 GHz, is presented and shown to agree with published literature. The effects on the computed weighting function of variation of several key factors, including measurement frequency and material temperature, are then considered for both phantom types. Further, limitations in the computational modelling in terms of finite bounds and the modelling of layers are investigated. Finally, techniques for obtaining the physical temperature distribution from multi - frequency microwave readings are considered in chapter 7 and their applicability at two frequencies is discussed. By making use of the data collected from the dual - frequency antenna and simulated microwave temperatures, the various methods of temperature profile retrieval are compared.
