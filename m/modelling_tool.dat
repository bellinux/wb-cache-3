6000|$|All souls have {{a vehicle}} or body, {{and when one}} has said that, with More and the Platonists one has escaped from the {{abstract}} schools who seek always the power of some church or institution, and found oneself with great poetry, and superstition which is but popular poetry, in a pleasant dangerous world. Beauty is indeed but bodily life in some ideal condition. The vehicle of the human soul is {{what used to be}} called the animal spirits, and Henry More quotes from Hippocrates this sentence: [...] "The mind of man is ... not nourished from meats and drinks from the belly, but by a clear luminous substance that redounds by separation from the blood." [...] These animal spirits fill up all parts of the body and make up the body of air, as certain writers of the seventeenth century have called it. The soul has a plastic power, and can after death, or during life, should the vehicle leave the body for a while, mould it to any shape it will by an act of imagination, though the more unlike to the habitual that shape is, the greater the effort. To living and dead alike, the purity and abundance of the animal spirits are a chief power. The soul can mould from these an apparition clothed as if in life, and make it visible by showing it to our mind's eye, or by building into its substance certain particles drawn from the body of a medium till it is as visible and tangible as any other object. To help that building the ancients offered fragrant gum, the odour of flowers, and it may be pieces of virgin wax. The half materialised vehicle slowly exudes from the skin in dull luminous drops or condenses from a luminous cloud, the light fading as weight and density increase. The witch, going beyond the medium, offered to the slowly animating phantom certain drops of her blood. The vehicle once separate from the living man or woman may be moulded by the souls of others as readily as by its own soul, and even it seems by the souls of the living. It becomes a part for a while of that stream of images which I have compared to reflections upon water. But how does it follow that souls who never have handled the <b>modelling</b> <b>tool</b> or the brush, make perfect images? Those materialisations who imprint their powerful faces upon paraffin wax, leave there sculpture that would have taken a good artist, making and imagining, many hours. How did it follow that an ignorant woman could, as Henry More believed, project her vehicle in so good a likeness of a hare, that horse and hound and huntsman followed with the bugle blowing? Is not the problem the same as of those finely articulated scenes and patterns that come out of the dark, seemingly completed in the winking of an eye, as we are lying half asleep, and of all those elaborate images that drift in moments of inspiration or evocation before the mind's eye? Our animal spirits or vehicles are but as it were a condensation of the vehicle of Anima Mundi, and give substance to its images in the faint materialisation of our common thought, or more grossly when a ghost is our visitor. It should be no great feat, once those images have dipped into our vehicle, to take their portraits in the photographic camera. Henry More will have it that a hen scared by a hawk when the cock is treading, hatches out a hawkheaded chicken (I am no stickler for the fact), because before the soul of the unborn bird could give the shape [...] "the deeply impassioned fancy of the mother" [...] called from the general cistern of form a competing image. [...] "The soul of the world," [...] he runs on, [...] "interposes and insinuates into all generations of things while the matter is fluid and yielding, which would induce a man to believe that she may not stand idle in the transformation of the vehicle of the daemons, but assist the fancies and desires, and so help to clothe them and to utter them according to their own pleasures; or it may be sometimes against their wills as the unwieldiness of the mother's fancy forces upon her a monstrous birth." [...] Though images appear to flow and drift, it may be that we but change in our relation to them, now losing, now finding with the shifting of our minds; and certainly Henry More speaks by the book, claiming that those images may be hard to the right touch as [...] "pillars of crystal" [...] and as solidly coloured as our own to the right eyes. Shelley, a good Platonist, seems in his earliest work to set this general soul in the place of God, an opinion, one may find from More's friend Cudworth now affirmed, now combated, by classic authority; but More would steady us with a definition. The general soul as apart from its vehicle is [...] "a substance incorporeal but without sense and animadversion pervading the whole matter of the universe and exercising a plastic power therein, according to the sundry predispositions and occasions, in the parts it works upon, raising such phenomena in the world, by directing the parts of the matter and their motion as cannot be resolved into mere mechanical powers." [...] I must assume that [...] "sense and animadversion," [...] perception and direction, are always faculties of individual soul, and that, as Blake said, [...] "God only acts or is in existing beings or men." ...|$|E

Once proper validation is complete on these ideal models, the user can then migrate to lower levels of abstraction until an actual real world model is designed. High-level <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> are the epitome of the top-down design concept in which design first takes place with the basic functional knowledge of a system.

40|$|Unified Modeling Language™ (UML) is an {{international}} standard for systems modeling. UML is used for modeling requirements, architecture, detailed design, and software code generation. UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> offer graphical editors for UML model development, generating software from UML models, creating UML models from the software, and supporting collaborative model development. This thesis offers new knowledge about UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> use, evaluation, and training. The main research question is: How can a globally distributed product company where UML modeling activities are scattered across different locations and countries implement a UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool?</b> Five studies comprise the research process. The first study provided new information concerning how UML and UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tools</b> {{can be used in}} the context of product requirements and release management process. In the second study, version management capabilities of the UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> were evaluated. The main contribution of this study was the creation and evaluation a set of evaluation criteria. A virtual meeting tool (VMT) -based training method for teaching UML and the features of a UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> was designed and evaluated in the third study. According to the study, the VMT-based training positively impacted learners’ skills, knowledge, and motivation and they were satisfied with the training. The training cost decreased in the case company by 88 % compared to traditional classroom training. In the fourth study, a new instrument was developed for measuring users’ satisfaction with the UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> and service. A longitudinal case study was conducted to evaluate several classes of e-teaching tools supporting the teaching of UML and the UML <b>modeling</b> <b>tool</b> during the fifth study.
