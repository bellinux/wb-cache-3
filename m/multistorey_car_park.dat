2500|$|Vicar Lane was redeveloped in 2000 {{to become}} a pedestrianised, open-air {{shopping}} centre, that involved {{almost all of the}} existing buildings being demolished including a Woolworths branch and a small bus station. The project was so large that two new shopping streets were created as part of the development. It now has major chains such as H and Argos. The development was originally planned in the 1980s but was delayed due to the economics at the time. A new <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on Beetwell Street was added as part of the revised plan. The area is located between the [...] "Pavements Centre" [...] and Markets and the [...] "Crooked Spire".|$|E
50|$|Development in the 1970s and 80s {{was more}} {{piecemeal}} than envisaged in Centreplan, {{with the building}} of the St. David's Centre and St David's Hall, new <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> and the grantsupported construction of the 14storey Holiday Inn (now the Marriott) and World Trade Centre (now the Cardiff International Arena), which gave a fillip to the city's conference and exhibition business. In the mid - 1980s developers returned to Queen Street, creating three mediumsized malls, helping it {{to become one of the}} best performing shopping streets in the country in terms of footfall and rental levels.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, {{planners}} described Cardiff {{city centre}} as [...] "worn out, inconvenient, drab and dangerous". The centre had escaped the extensive wartime bomb damage inflicted on other cities, so little redevelopment {{took place in}} the 1950s and 1960s. The Buchanan Plan of 1964 envisaged a highly ambitious extended city centre, crossed with urban motorways. The council scrapped the proposed motorway network and focused on the small commercial core of the city; its proposed redevelopment scheme, in partnership with a private developer, would have seen almost all of the city centre (except St Mary Street and Working Street) demolished, replaced by modernist office towers of up to 21 storeys and pedestrianised decks linking <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> to covered shopping malls.|$|R
5000|$|The site now {{occupied}} by the shopping centre was previously the Wandsworth Greyhound Stadium (which seated 20,000) and the Upper Mill (a large flour mill, damaged by fire in the 1920s and demolished in 1964). The Arndale complex {{was designed to be}} relatively self-contained, with few connections to the surrounding shopping streets other than service and delivery entrances, and value of the complex was maximised by the construction of five high-rise blocks above the main shopping area, and by building over a thousand <b>parking</b> spaces in <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> It included a health clinic and a day centre, as well as a post office. Because it was built right over the River Wandle, it was considered something of an architectural and engineering achievement. [...] However it was not universally popular, and its large size led to it being described by some contemporary commentators as [...] "one of London’s great architectural disasters".|$|R

40|$|Common {{objectives}} {{of the formation of}} mixed-use city centres are discussed, mostly focusing on local centres of residential districts. Vitality and viability are the main features of mixed-use city centres influencing the potential to encourage investment and adapt to changing needs of society. Seeking to improve vitality and competitiveness of local centres, in comparison with shopping and entertainment centres, there should be ensured sufficient density and flexibility to respond to the changing conditions, increased diversity of uses, enhanced environmental quality, maximized accessibility by public transport and by walking, reducing the need to travel by car. The largest part of residential district centres of Lithuanian cities were formed using the principle of separating pedestrian and vehicle flows and ignoring the integration of movement and social interaction, the historic function of streets. To improve accessibility there could be introduced, where appropriate, new streets inside a residential district. Another way to improve the structure of existing centres is to use undeveloped sites, orientating the new buildings so that they front the street and providing <b>multistorey</b> or underground <b>car</b> <b>parking.</b> Article in Lithuanian</p...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Camber, Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on New Lydd road {{which also has}} a large {{overflow}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> opposite, Central <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> and the new <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on the old crazy golf site on Old Lydd road. Central also has a large overflow <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Only Central has {{direct access to the}} beach, as you have to negotiate long steep sandy paths over the dunes to reach the beach from Western <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> unsuitable for prams, or wheelchairs. The Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> closes at 8pm in the summer.|$|R

50|$|Work {{therefore}} {{began to}} extensively refurbish {{and extend the}} complex in 2000. This included the complete demolition and reconstruction of {{the southern end of}} the structure, to add a new 860-space <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> a 14 screen Cineworld cinema, and a food concourse. A large Waitrose supermarket was also built, to anchor the relaunched centre. A glazed roof to the Central Mall was introduced to make better use of natural light (a common but now outdated feature of Arndale centres had been that the walkways were deliberately kept dark, so that the lights from the shops would shine out).|$|E
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{shopping}} centre was originally anchored by a Sainsbury's supermarket, Woolworths, Boots and Marks & Spencer. The 1981 Eastern extension {{added a new}} anchor store - BHS and another <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> as well as numerous other shops. Sainsbury's moved out in the mid 1990s as the store was small by modern standards and Woolworths closed during the 2008/9 Christmas period because the retailer had gone into administration. Recent retailers to move into Fareham Shopping centre include Next (opened September 2010) and HMV (opened November 2010 - Closed in February 2011, clearly on a short term contract for the festive season) and Debenhams which opened in Summer 2011.|$|E

They obtained a revised planning permission in 2002 for a larger and more extensive redevelopment than the previous Fordgate Wandsworth project, which included a 36,000 sq ft branch of Primark, an increase {{in the size of the}} cinema to 14 screens, as well as the demolition and reconstruction of the southern end of the centre including retail space and the <b>multistorey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> and a comprehensive refurbishment of the interior of the centre (aside from Arndale Walk), and implemented these plans over the following two years.|$|E
