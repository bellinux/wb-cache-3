All branches first sagged down for 20 {{days and then}} moved up for 40 days. Then, control branches reversed and moved back down while branches in both girdle treatments continued to move up. <b>Movement</b> <b>reversal</b> correlated with cessation of both elongation and diameter growth in control branches. Diameter growth continued in branches of girdled trees. Control branches continued to stiffen even after diameter growth stopped. Differences in movements due to girdling are from compression wood formed after cessation of branch elongation. Apical control stops cambial activity and compression wood formation in branches after branch elongation ceases, allowing photosynthate produced in the branch {{to move to the}} stem. Control branches bend down from increasing self-weight after cambial activity ceases...|$|E

Seven male visited the laboratory on two occasions: 1) the maximum vertical jump height was determined followed by vertical jumps habituation; 2) participants performed intermittent countermovement jumps until fatigue. Kinematic and kinetic variables were recorded. The overall reduction in vertical jump height was 5, 5 %, while the movement duration increased 10 % during the test. The thigh segment angle at <b>movement</b> <b>reversal</b> significantly increased as the exercise progressed. Non-significant effect of fatigue on movement synergy was found for the intersegmental coordination pattern. More than 90 % of the intersegmental coordination was explained by one coordination pattern. Thigh rotation contributed the most to the intersegmental coordination pattern, with the trunk second and the shank the least. Therefore, one intersegmental coordination pattern is followed throughout the vertical jumps until fatigue and thigh rotation contributes the most to jump height...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{explores the}} environment {{using a combination}} of different movement patterns, which include straight <b>movement,</b> <b>reversal,</b> and turns. We propose to quantify C. elegans movement behavior using a computer vision approach based on run-length encoding of step-length data. In this approach, the path of C. elegans is encoded as a string of characters, where each character represents a path segment of a specific type of movement. With these encoded string data, we perform k-means cluster analysis to distinguish movement behaviors resulting from different genotypes and food availability. We found that shallow and sharp turns are the most critical factors in distinguishing the differences among the movement behaviors. To validate our approach, we examined the movement behavior of tph- 1 mutants that lack an enzyme responsible for serotonin biosynthesis. A k-means cluster analysis with the path string-encoded data showed that tph- 1 movement behavior on food {{is similar to that of}} wild-type animals off food. We suggest that this run-length encoding approach is applicable to trajectory data in animal or human mobility data...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{an action}} can consist of {{generating}} {{a change in the}} environment (to produce an effect) or changing one's own situation in the environment (to move to a physical target). To investigate whether the mechanisms of effect-directed and target-directed action control are similar, participants performed continuous <b>reversal</b> <b>movements.</b> They either synchronized <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> with regularly presented tones (temporal targets) or produced tones at reversals isochronously (temporal effects). In both goal conditions an irrelevant goal characteristic was integrated into the goal representation (loudness, Experiment 1). When targets and effects were presented within the same <b>reversal</b> <b>movement,</b> similarities were enhanced (Experiment 2). When the task posed spatial demands in addition to temporal demands, target- and effect-directed movement kinematics changed equally with tempo (Experiment 3). Correlations between target-directed and effect-directed movements in temporal variability indicated similar timing mechanisms (Experiments 1 and 2). Only gradual differences between target- and effect-directed movements were observed. We conclude that the same mechanisms of action control, including the anticipation of upcoming events, underlie effect-directed and target-directed movements. Ideomotor theories of action control should incorporate action targets as goals similar to action effects...|$|R

We have used genetic and electrophysiological methods to demonstrate that NMR- 1, a Caenorhabditis elegans NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, {{plays a role in}} the control of movement and foraging behavior. nmr- 1 mutants show a lower probability of switching from forward to backward movement and a reduced ability to navigate a complex environment. Electrical recordings from the interneuron AVA show that NMDA-dependent currents are selectively disrupted in nmr- 1 mutants. We also show that a slowly desensitizing variant of a non-NMDA receptor can rescue the nmr- 1 mutant phenotype. We propose that NMDA receptors in C. elegans provide long-lived currents that modulate the frequency of <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> during foraging behavior...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. A {{fundamental question}} about motor control {{is related to}} the nature of the representations used by the nervous system to program the movement. Theoretically, arm displacement can be encoded either in task (extrinsic) or in joint (intrinsic) space. 2. The present study investigated the organization of complex movements consisting of reaching and grasping a cylindrical object presented along different orientations in space. In some trials, object orientation was suddenly modified at movement onset. 3. At a static level, the final limb angles were highly predictable despite the wide range of possible postures allowed by articular redundancy. Moreover, when object orientation was unexpectedly modified at movement onset, the final angular configuration of the limb was identical to that obtained when the object was initially presented along the orientation reached after the perturbation. 4. At a dynamical level, a generalized synergy was observed, and tight correlations were noted between all joint angles implicated in the movement with the exception of elbow flexion. For this joint angle, which did not vary monotonically, strong partial correlations were however observed before and after <b>movement</b> <b>reversal.</b> 5. These results suggest that natural movements are mostly carried out in joint space by postural transitions...|$|E
40|$|Continuous rhythmic {{movements}} are often geared toward particular {{points in the}} movement cycle, as evidenced by a local reduction in trajectory variability. These so-called anchor points provide a window into motor control, since changes {{in the degree of}} anchoring may reveal how informational and/or neuromuscular properties are exploited in the organization of rhythmic movements. The present experiment examined the relative contributions of informational timing (metronome beeps) and neuromuscular (wrist postures) constraints on anchoring by systematically varying both factors at <b>movement</b> <b>reversal</b> points. To this end, participants cycled their right wrist in a flexed, neutral, or extended posture, either self-paced or synchronized to a metronome pacing peak flexion, peak extension, or both peak flexion and extension. The effects of these manipulations were assessed in terms of kinematics, auditory-motor coordination, and muscle activity. The degree of anchoring seen at the reversal points depended on the degree of compatibility of the prevailing configuration of neuromuscular and informational timing constraints, which had largely independent effects. We further observed systematic changes in muscular activity, which revealed distinct contributions of posture- and muscle-dependent neuromuscular properties to motor control. These findings indicate that the anchor-based discretization of the control of continuous rhythmic wrist movements is determined by both informational timing and neuromuscular constraints in a task-specific manner with subtle interactions between the two, and exemplify how movement variability may be exploited to gain such insights. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|E

Transgenic worms that expressed a mutated C. elegans glutamate receptor in interneurons that control locomotion displayed a remarkable and unexpected change in their behavior—they rapidly alternated between forward and backward coordinated movement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of amplitude scaling on bimanual coordination in a circle drawing task. Eleven right-handed subjects traced the perimeter of 5 circles measuring 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 cm in diameter under the following coordination conditions: (1) both hands move inward together (symmetric coordination pattern), and (2) both hands move counterclockwise together (asymmetric coordination pattern). In a set of self-paced trials, subjects traced each circle separately at a preferred frequency and separately for each coordination pattern. Although subjects matched the required amplitude of the target circles quite well, radial amplitude variability increased with increasing circle diameter. No transitions or <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> were observed in the self-paced trials, and the symmetric pattern was more stable than the asymmetric pattern. In a set of amplitude scaling trials, subjects continuously traced the 5 circles from small (3 cm) to big (15 cm) (SB) and from big to small (BS) at two fixed pacing frequencies (1. 25 Hz and 1. 5 Hz). Observed cycling frequency decreased with increasing circle diameter, and observed radial amplitude was most accurate when tracing the 9 cm diameter circle, with larger than required amplitude when tracing the 3 cm and 6 cm diameter circles, and smaller than required amplitude when tracing the 12 cm and 15 cm diameter circles. Radial amplitude variability also increased with increasing circle diameter in the amplitude scaling trials. The symmetric coordination pattern was more stable than the symmetric coordination pattern. Transitions from the asymmetric to symmetric coordination pattern as well as <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> were observed in both scaling directions. No transitions occurred while producing the symmetric pattern in any scaling direction or pacing frequency condition. The results show that amplitude scaling influenced the spatiotemporal aspects of bimanual circle drawing. Moreover, amplitude scaling induced more transitions than previous research that scaled movement frequency as a control parameter in bimanual circle drawing tasks...|$|R
40|$|Optogenetics {{has been}} {{recently}} applied {{to manipulate the}} neural circuits of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to investigate its mechanosensation and locomotive behavior, which is a fundamental topic in model biology. In most neuron-related research, free C. elegans moves on an open area such as agar surface. However, this simple environment {{is different from the}} soil, in which C. elegans naturally dwells. To bridge up the gap, this paper presents integration of optogenetic illumination of C. elegans neural circuits and muscular force measurement in a structured microfluidic chip mimicking the C. elegans soil habitat. The microfluidic chip is essentially a ∼ 1 x 1 cm 2 elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane micro-pillar array, configured in either form of lattice (LC) or honeycomb (HC) to mimic the environment in which the worm dwells. The integrated system has four key modules for illumination pattern generation, pattern projection, automatic tracking of the worm, and force measurement. Specifically, two optical pathways co-exist in an inverted microscope, including built-in bright-field illumination for worm tracking and pattern generation, and added-in optogenetic illumination for pattern projection onto the worm body segment. The behavior of a freely moving worm in the chip under optogenetic manipulation can be recorded for off-line force measurements. Using wild-type N 2 C. elegans, we demonstrated optical illumination of C. elegans neurons by projecting light onto its head/tail segment at 14 Hz refresh frequency. We also measured the force and observed three representative locomotion patterns of forward <b>movement,</b> <b>reversal,</b> and omega turn for LC and HC configurations. Being capable of stimulating or inhibiting worm neurons and simultaneously measuring the thrust force, this enabling platform would offer new insights into the correlation between neurons and locomotive behaviors of the nematode under a complex environment...|$|E

Overall these results suggest that, at lower movement frequencies, voluntary and automatic GF control processes operate at different hierarchical levels.

Our results indicate that eclogite-facies metamorphism happened in two successive phases: first, inherited granulitic garnet was fractured and reequilibrated from their boundaries (crystal or fracture rims); then eclogite-facies minerals were crystallised in the fractures as overgrowths on inherited garnets. The reequilibration of inherited garnets is achieved through Fe 2 +Mg− 1 exchange, whereas eclogite-facies garnets crystallised during the subsequent phase are notably richer in Ca than un- and re-equilibrated granulitic garnet. Pseudosection construction shows that this lack in Ca reequilibration cannot be related to variations in thermodynamic conditions (a H 2 O, reacting system composition) between the two phases. From the compilation of the available data, the reequilibration of granulitic garnet seems to be controlled by the inefficient intra- and inter-granular transport properties of Ca compared to Fe 2 + and Mg. While these kinetic factors confine garnet reequilibration to Fe 2 +Mg− 1 exchange, the extent of reequilibration along this exchange vector is controlled by partitioning with adjacent omphacite. On the contrary to the diffusional reequilibration of granulitic garnet that lasted for several My according to our modelling of the diffusional relaxation, the strong compositional gradients between eclogite-facies and reequilibrated garnets, which are almost unaffected by diffusional reequilibration, provide evidence that rapid exhumation followed the crystallisation of eclogite-facies minerals. We propose that the <b>movement</b> <b>reversal</b> itself, from burial to exhumation, and associated deformation and fluid flow, triggered this crystallisation event. The resulting evolution near metamorphic peak conditions is therefore strongly asymmetrical: on the one hand, the prograde diffusional relaxation profiles indicate slow movement during the last stages of burial, whereas the unaffected retrograde overgrowth indicates fast exhumation rates...|$|E
30|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the behavior of}} handicapped individuals could benefit from a strategy that attempts to unveil their motor control adaptations rather than looking for differences between them and the typically developing individuals. In the present study, we investigated how DS individuals with two levels of handicap learned a sequential task. The study failed to provide enough practice experience to secure a better chance for them to learn the task. Nevertheless, there is a trend for performance differences between the two DS groups that might suggest different motor control strategies used by each group. Further studies need to consider at least four aspects: (1) increase the amount of practice and include a retention and transfer task to disentangle performance and learning effects; (2) include tasks with different number of items to check for the demand on the span of the short-term memory; (3) include tasks with various spatial configuration, i.e., with and without <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> and changes in the movement direction to test for online programming.|$|R
40|$|A central {{question}} within {{the domain of}} human cognition {{is whether or not}} the ability to replace a current action with a new one (i. e., cognitive control) depends on a conscious appreciation of the environmental change that necessitates the new behavior.

We show for the first time that individuals are able to use non-consciously perceived information to modify the course and outcome of an ongoing action.

50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|R
40|$|Whilst it is {{recognised}} that contraction {{plays an}} important part in maintaining the structure and function of mature skeletal muscle, its role during development remains undefined. In this study the role of movement in skeletal muscle maturation was investigated in intact zebrafish embryos using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches. An immotile mutant line (cacnb 1 ts 25) which lacks functional voltage-gated calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors) in the muscle and pharmacological immobilisation of embryos with a reversible anaesthetic (Tricaine), allowed the study of paralysis (in mutants and anaesthetised fish) and recovery of <b>movement</b> (<b>reversal</b> of anaesthetic treatment). The effect of paralysis in early embryos (aged between 17 - 24 hours post fertilisation, hpf) on skeletal muscle structure at both myofibrillar and myofilament level was determined using both immunostaining with confocal microscopy and small angle X-ray diffraction. The consequences of paralysis and subsequent recovery on the localisation of the actin capping proteins Tropomodulin 1 & 4 (Tmod) in fish aged from 17 hpf until 42 hpf was also assessed. The functional consequences of early paralysis were investigated by examining the mechanical properties of the larval muscle. The length-force relationship, active and passive tension, was measured in immotile, recovered and control skeletal muscle at 5 and 7 day post fertilisation (dpf). Recovery of muscle function was also assessed by examining swimming patterns in recovered and control fish. Inhibition of the initial embryonic movements (up to 24 hpf) resulted in an increase in myofibril length and a decrease in width followed by almost complete recovery in both moving and paralysed fish by 42 hpf. In conclusion, myofibril organisation is regulated by a dual mechanism involving movement-dependent and movement-independent processes. The initial contractile event itself drives the localisation of Tmod 1 to its sarcomeric position, capping the actin pointed ends and ultimately regulating actin length. This study demonstrates that both contraction and contractile-independent mechanisms are important for the regulation of myofibril organisation, which in turn is necessary for establishing proper skeletal muscle structure and function during development in vivo in zebrafish...|$|E

40|$|When {{movements}} are performed {{together in the}} upper-limbs, a strong tendency emerges to synchronize the patterns of motor output. This is most apparent when trying to do different things at the same time. The present experiment explored the simultaneous organization and control of spatiotemporally different movements. There were two practice conditions: symmetrical and asymmetrical. In the symmetrical condition, subjects performed a series of unidirectional elbow flexion movements, followed {{by a series of}} elbow flexion-extension-flexion (<b>reversal)</b> <b>movements</b> in both limbs simultaneously. In the asymmetrical practice condition, subjects performed the unidirectional movement in the left limb together with the <b>reversal</b> <b>movement</b> in the right limb. Findings revealed a tendency for each limb movement to assimilate the features of its counterpart under the latter condition. This effect was "asymmetrical" in that the unidirectional movement was more attracted to the <b>reversal</b> <b>movement</b> than vice versa. Nevertheless, subjects were able to partly suppress this synchronization tendency as was evident from the moderate cross correlations between the angular acceleration patterns of both limb movements and from an increasingly successful differentiation of the activity levels in the right and left limb muscles.

The data are discussed in view of the possible suppression of a bilaterally distributed motor control system, that is mainly held responsible for activiting proximal limb musculature. status: publishe...|$|R

In the case of catching a ball within arm’s reach, that identification has been complicated by empirical disparities concerning hand-movement reversals dur-ing catching. Jacobs and Michaels (J Exp Psychol Hum 32 : 443 – 458, 2006) found unilateral reversals in a par-adigm in which balls swung down in an arc; this implicated a particular optical variable, the ratio of lateral velocity to expansion velocity. Montagne et al. (Exp Brain Res 129 : 87 – 92, 1999) reported bilateral reversals when balls approached along a linear trajec-tory, which implicated a different variable, lateral ball position. The research reported here attempted to replicate Montagne et al. ’s (Exp Brain Res 129 : 87 – 92, 1999) findings. In Experiment 1, participants caught balls rolling toward them across a table, under full lighting using monocular or binocular viewing; in Experiment 2, participants caught luminous balls with a luminous glove in an otherwise dark room. Using Montagne et al. ’s (Exp Brain Res 129 : 87 – 92, 1999) criterion, we observed no <b>movement</b> <b>reversals</b> in any condition, though some aspects of hand movements suggested the relevance of lateral ball position.

40|$|Background: In {{minimally}} invasive surgery, force feed-back information on tissue manipulation is altered by {{friction between the}} instrument and the sealing mecha-nism of the trocar. It is unknown how the different sealing mechanisms of currently available trocars influ-ence the friction forces. The current study investigated the dynamic changes in friction for various trocars at different instrument velocities. Methods: The friction characteristics for six common types of trocars were determined. A force sensor {{was attached to the}} shaft of a standard 5 -mm disposable grasper to measure the forces required to move it through the trocars. Movement velocity and direction of the shaft were controlled by a servomotor. In addition, whether moistening the shaft reduced friction was tes-ted. Results: The friction depended on the type of trocar, the movement velocity, and the movement direction, and varied between 0. 25 and 3. 0 N. Specifically, trocars with narrow sealing caps (i. e., high normal force onto the shaft) and trocars with thick sealing caps (i. e., large contact area) generate a high amount of friction. Moistening the shaft reduced friction 15 % to 45 %. For most trocars, large fluctuations in forces occur when the movement starts or when the direction reverses. The magnitude of these fluctuations varied between 0. 2 and 2. 5 N. Conclusions: For some trocars, friction can be as great as the forces associated with instrument–tissue interac-tion. At <b>movement</b> <b>reversals,</b> friction fluctuates due to deformations of the rubber and silicon parts of the sealing mechanism. Such high variance can deteriorate surgical performance during high precision tasks (e. g., tissue manipulation) that typically involve many chan-ges in movement direction.

[...] The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first English language usage in 1799 in a translation of Lazare Carnot's letter on the Coup of 18 Fructidor.|$|R
40|$|Movement {{times to}} a single target are {{typically}} shorter compared to when movement to a second target is required. This one target movement time advantage {{has been shown to}} emerge when participants use a single hand throughout the target sequence and when there is a switch between hands at the first target. Our goal was to investigate the lacuna in the movement integration literature surrounding the interactive effects between switching hands and changing movement direction at the first target. Participants performed rapid hand movements in five conditions; movements {{to a single}} target; two target movements with a single hand in which the second target required an extension or reversal in direction; and movements to two targets where the hands were switched at the first target and the second target required an extension or reversal in direction. The significance of including these latter two (multiple hand-multiple direction) movements meant {{that for the first time}} research could differentiate between peripheral and central processes within movement integration strategies. Reaction times were significantly shorter in the single task compared to the two target tasks. More importantly, movement times to the first target were significantly shorter in the single target task compared to all two target tasks (reflecting the so-called one target advantage), except when the second <b>movement</b> was a <b>reversal</b> <b>movement</b> with the same hand. These findings demonstrate for the first time the contrasting effects of movement integration at central and peripheral levels...|$|R
40|$|The coupled {{unsteady}} turbulent {{boundary layer}} and potential flow about a pitching airfoil are analyzed using numerical methods {{to determine the effect}} of pitch rate on the delay in forward movement of the rear flow reversal point. An explicit finite difference scheme is used to integrate the unsteady boundary layer equations, which are coupled at each instant of time to a fully unsteady and nonlinear potential flow analysis. A substantial delay in forward <b>movement</b> of the <b>reversal</b> point is demonstrated with increasing pitch rate, and it is shown that the delay results partly from the alleviation of the gradients in the potential flow, and partly from the effects of unsteadiness in the boundary layer itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine if an inaccurately {{acquired}} motor response can be relearned through the provision of a limited number of correct KR trials. 26 subjects were assigned to one of three experimental groups: a no-KR group, an erroneous KR group, and a relearning group who were given correct KR after 125 trials of erroneous KR. Analysis showed a significant temporal correction of the <b>reversal</b> <b>movement</b> when the erroneous KR was replaced by valid verbal information during acquisition. This adaptation, however, was attenuated during retention, indicating that the limited number of correct KR trials did not wash out the effect of the invalid information provided during the first phase of acquisition. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Noted by Hewitt and Hall-Taylor (1970), two {{criteria}} {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the onset of liquid loading. These criteria are the minimum pressure gradient and the zero-wall shear stress. If the gas velocity is gradually reduced in an upward concurrent flow, the pressure gradient falls until a minimum is reached. At this instant, the flow reversal point is reached. Due to the effects of the gravitational force in upward annular flow, the liquid film shear stress falls from the interface to the wall. Reducing the gas velocity decreases the interfacial shear stress. Gradually, the wall shear stress falls to zero. Further reduction in the interfacial shear can result in a negative wall shear stress, an indication of downward liquid film <b>movement</b> (flow <b>reversal)</b> on the wall. Most experimental analyses use the minimum pressure gradient as the point for flow reversal as presented in (Westende 2008; Guner 2012). It can be concluded that the mechanistic models trials so far have several problems and have not attained a satisfactory results that match the experiments and still need to be improved. Numerical techniques could be the best alternative.|$|R
