50|$|In 1913, a stop {{en route}} at Sandhills was renamed Bargara derived by amalgamating the words Barolin and Woongarra. A daily rail <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> between Bundaberg and Pemberton from 1919 to 1921 but {{thereafter}} only seaside trains ran {{during the summer}} months. As occurred elsewhere, road transport took over carriage of sugar cane.|$|E
50|$|Top {{speed was}} 30 km/h (19 mi/h). The {{electric}} <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> at a nominal potential of 88 volts {{and a maximum}} current of 40 amperes.

50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the new design is an interactive anaphoric star disc, an astronomical machine based on the anaphoric clock of antiquity. It is probably {{the largest and most}} accurate anaphoric star disc ever made. Park visitors can rotate the star disk to a display the stars for a given date and time with a <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> by buttons on the base.|$|E
50|$|The organ {{contains}} 22 {{ranks with}} 1248 speaking pipes. A Rose water motor {{was used to}} supply power to operate the organ. The Rose water <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> off the municipal water pressure which, in turn, caused a ratchet to move up and down, connected to the bellows. This allowed the church to fore-go hiring a bellows boy to pump the organ.|$|E
50|$|Manually {{operated}} {{ball valves}} can be closed quickly and thus {{there is a}} danger of water hammer. Some ball valves are equipped with an actuator that may be pneumatically, hydraulically or <b>motor</b> <b>operated.</b> These valves can be used either for on/off or flow control. A pneumatic flow control valve is also equipped with a positioner which transforms the control signal into actuator position and valve opening accordingly.|$|E

50|$|Safety during pigging {{relies on}} the strict {{adherence}} to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe valve operating sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to manual and <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> valves and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.|$|E
50|$|The Maryborough-Avoca railway {{line was}} {{completed}} on 28 October 1876, passing {{north of the}} settlement of Adelaide Lead. The Adelaide Lead station was opened in 1887. Initially there was one train each way daily. Later services were doubled but were reduced to daily services in World War 1 and reduced again in the 1930s. In 1936 mixed train services ceased and a passenger rail <b>motor</b> <b>operated.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{isolation}} groups include the main steamlines, the reactor water cleanup system, the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system, shutdown cooling, and the residual heat removal system. For pipes which inject {{water into the}} containment, two safety-related check valves are generally used in lieu of <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> valves. These valves must be tested regularly as well to ensure they do indeed seal and prevent leakage even against high reactor pressures.|$|E

By removing the fixing screw the grinder can be disassembled completely for cleaning. Besides the domestic manually or <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> grinders, there are also grinders for butchery (table- or shop-grinders for example) and for the food industry. Some large machines are able to produce several tons per hour.|$|E
50|$|Two {{employees}} of the defendant company were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes in a well they were attempting to decontaminate. The plaintiff, a doctor, went in to try to rescue them {{even though he was}} warned of the fumes and told that the fire brigade was on the way. The fumes had been caused by the company negligently placing a <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> pump {{at the bottom of the}} well on some scaffolding in order to assist in the pumping out of the well. All three men died.|$|E
5000|$|The basic Mini-T is {{sold as a}} {{complete}}, ready-to-run package, {{complete with}} painted and trimmed Lexan body. The design of the Mini-T is based on Losi's XXX-T 1/10-scale truck; despite the Mini-T's diminutive size, handling characteristics and overall vehicle dynamics are remarkably similar to the larger truck. Power comes from a Mabuchi RS-280 <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> via a miniature electronic speed control. Four [...] "AA" [...] alkaline batteries are required to power the truck; eight are required for the transmitter. Six-cell nickel metal hydride and 3S lithium polymer batteries are available for longer and faster runtimes and more economical long-term operation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{tracking}} of faulty lines of induction <b>motors</b> <b>operating</b> under fault. The approach suggested in this paper deals with the particle swarm optimization to explore the search space which incorporates chaos. This one should be an opportunity to extract the principal faulty lines, in a current spectrum, dealing with a rotor broken bar whatever the <b>motor</b> <b>operates</b> at variable frequency or not. The algorithm uses an adaptive inertia weight which is added a chaotic process. The ability of chaos to estimate the line frequency and the fault line frequencies is made. The induction <b>motor</b> <b>operates</b> at steady state and under one full broken bar. Experiments prove that particle swarm optimization approach is an efficient method both to solve the optimization problem and to quickly extract information from a spectrum. Moreover, the paper shows the interest of chaos since it enlarges the searching space in quasi steady state...|$|R

50|$|Another type of SCR {{inverter}} circuit {{is the current}} source input (CSI) inverter. A CSI inverter is the dual of a six-step voltage source inverter. With a current source inverter, the DC power supply is configured as a current source rather than a voltage source. The inverter SCRs are switched in a six-step sequence to direct the current to a three-phase AC load as a stepped current waveform. CSI inverter commutation methods include load commutation and parallel capacitor commutation. With both methods, the input current regulation assists the commutation. With load commutation, the load is a synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>operated</b> at a leading power factor.|$|E
5000|$|John Ernst Worrell Keely (September 3, 1837 - November 18, 1898) was an American {{inventor}} from Philadelphia {{who claimed}} to have discovered a new motive power which was originally described as [...] "vaporic" [...] or [...] "etheric" [...] force, and later as an unnamed force based on [...] "vibratory sympathy", by which he produced [...] "interatomic ether" [...] from water and air. Despite numerous requests from the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, which had been established to produce a practicable motor based on his work, he consistently refused to reveal to them the principles on which his <b>motor</b> <b>operated,</b> and also repeatedly refused demands to produce a marketable product by claiming that he needed to perform more experiments.|$|E
50|$|Volvo {{automobiles}} {{have been}} regularly imported to Indonesia since 1971, when Liem Sioe Liong's PT Central Sole Agency gained the concession. By 1975, industrial policy dictated that the cars be assembled locally and Liem responded {{by creating a}} joint venture called PT Salim Jaya <b>Motor,</b> <b>operated</b> by his son Albert. They assembled two Volvo models and had a steady market {{in the form of}} military and government officials. The venture lost money though, due to the difficulties of collecting money from government officials during the Suharto era. The Salim Group still imports Volvo trucks, buses, and construction equipment as of 2017, through a company called PT Indotruck Utama. Since January 2017, Garansindo is the sole importer and distributor of Volvo automobiles in Indonesia.|$|E
