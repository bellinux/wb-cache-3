30|$|The {{extraction}} process {{was carried out}} in a batch vessel. The batch vessel was placed in a water bath on a heater to control the temperature. For all the extraction experiments, the Heidolph MR 3001  K heater and <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>plate</b> with temperature control was used. The batch vessels were maintained at 25  ±  1  °C using heating and cooling loops. The experiment was divided into two parts to investigate the efficiency of ionic liquids in different samples of diesel, one with a higher sulfur content and the other with a lower sulfur content. Furthermore, the reusability as well as the efficiency of regenerated ionic liquids was investigated in addition to the investigation of core parameters affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of ionic liquids in extractive desulfurization namely, number of extraction stages and extraction time. The diesel was fed into a 50  mL round bottom flasks and placed in a temperature controlled water bath. Ionic liquid was added to the flasks in a 1 : 4 mass ratio. The flask contents were stirred for 30  min to get good contact between the phases. The mixture was then allowed to settle for 30  min to obtain phase splitting and settling, samples of the upper layer, the raffinate were withdrawn and analyzed by ICP-AES. For the experiments investigating the reusability of the ionic liquid, the bottom phase which is the loaded IL phase was fed, together with fresh diesel oil, into a round bottom flask, and allowed to be in contact as explained above. When investigating the optimum number of extraction stages after the first stage, the remaining diesel oil phase was fed to the second stage with fresh ionic liquid. Hexane was used for the re-extraction of sulfur from loaded IL and the efficiency of the regenerated IL was studied, i.e., the extraction ability of regenerated IL was studied and compared with that of fresh IL and reused (without regeneration) IL. After each desulfurization experiment, the solvent-rich phase was kept to recover the ionic liquids. The S-containing ILs were regenerated by dissolution with a suitable solvent and dried off by vacuum evaporation at 100  °C for 10  h for the clear separation of the ionic liquid and solvent in a Vismara V 065 vacuum oven connected to a Pall vacuum pump. The purity of the regenerated ILs was determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR. The extraction performance of the regenerated ILs was investigated and compared with results obtained for fresh ILs. The same procedure described earlier for the desulfurization of diesel was followed and after each experiment the IL was regenerated, this was done up to 4 times, i.e., 4 regeneration cycles.|$|E

At this lab using adsorption method, using the bentonite as adsorbent with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> hot <b>plate.</b> Selection of bentonite as adsorbent because bentonite has the ability to adsorbs camphene compounds. With reduced levels of camphene in ginger oil, then zingiberene levels will increase. Based on practice is known that the longer the time it adsorbs the more compounds camphene be absorbed by bentonite, so that sooner zingiberene levels increased. Meanwhile, the higher the temperature it adsorbs the compounds that camphene be absorbed by bentonite back zingiberene apart so that the levels will decrease. Differences in variables such as time and temperature adsorption adsorbs very influential on lab results. This variable distinction serves to determine optimum operating conditions in the process of adsorption ginger oil with bentonite. Factors that affect the process adsrobi are temperature, time, stirring speed, absorbent surface area and concentration of the adsorbate. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{falls into}} four fields of study. The {{first is a}} survey of {{relevant}} literature concerning the many theories of stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embritt 1 ement. This includes descriptions of the mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and outlines electromechanical processes and stress - sorption theory. Four widely accepted mechanisms for environment assisted cracking are also outlined. They are, 1) Embritt 1 ement resulting from accumulated hydrogen at embritt 1 ement sites, 2) Lowering of surface energy by adsorption of hydrogen, 3) Hydrogen interaction with dislocations, and 4) Lowering of the binding energy by interaction of hydrogen. The literature survey is {{a significant part of}} this thesis. The overall objective of the survey is to review a series of current SCC tests on high strength steels. The principal findings from these previous studies are summarized, they provide concrete evidence for the conclusion that SCC of high strength steels is due to hydrogen embrittlement. The second part of the project deals with the development of a stress corrosion loading clevis suitable for testing compact tension specimens. Three existing constant load rigs were developed, and equipment was designed for the successful operation of the rigs. Corrosive environment was applied to the standard compact tension specimen using a novel circulation system based on a <b>magnetic</b> <b>plate</b> <b>stirrer.</b> Corrosive solution (3. 5 % NaCl) was stirred by the magnetic plate, and the vortex created by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> was used to create a pumping head. The third area of work dealt with the testing of compact tension specimens of ULTIMO 200 steel using the developed apparatus. The experimental procedures used are based on the application of linear elastic fracture mechanics to stress corrosion cracking. The fourth area of work carried out was to perform slot length calibration experiments on CT specimens by using strain gauges. The results indicated that the specimens pre-cracked in air with a higher dynamic load gave higher threshold stress intensities (KIscc) than those pre-cracked in air with a lower dynamic load. An electron microscope study indicated evidence of a largely inter granular fatigue crack having occurred in the specimens pre-cracked with a high dynamic load...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time a cyclone {{evaporator}} has been designed and tested with perfectly wetting liquids in two separate experiments on condensation, at variable gravity conditions during parabolic flights. Two liquids (FC- 72 and HFE- 7100), with surface tension coefficient of 12 - 15 mN/m, were used in the experiments. The concept of the liquid retention by the centrifugal force and the specific design of the walls were validated in the first series of experiments in isothermal conditions. The liquid behaviour inside the experimental cell in weightlessness is reported and discussed for the variable liquid volume (100 - 200 ml) inside the cell and the rotating velocity of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> inside the evaporator (0 - 900 rpm). The data obtained during the isothermal case were used to improve the design of the evaporation cell for the non-isothermal case, tested during a second parabolic flight campaign. In this second experiment, both the power (1. 8 - 16 W) and rotational velocity of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> (0 - 250 rpm) were varied. For a fluid charge of 100 ml the same fluid never left the evaporator in all tests performed with rotation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b> The vapour pressure in the cell increased during microgravity period.
