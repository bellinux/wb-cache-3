40|$|<b>Marl</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{which is}} {{regularly}} used in knitwear {{and contributes to}} the scope of knitted fabrics, is often used {{in response to the}} colour effects that this yarn can offer the designer. Whilst there is relatively little understanding of the formation of such colour effects, this paper summarises a study on a <b>marl</b> <b>yarn</b> knitting technique to move the level of understanding forward. In this study, four elements: yarn type, yarn colours, knitting machine gauge, and knitting structure have each been considered within the knitting process. A set of 72 samples were knitted by combining different elements systematically. A new terminology marledness has been defined and is referred to as: two plied or twisted yarns of different colours to form a knitted sample with colour effects that are evenly distributed in a dotted manner. If the yarns are not twisted together before knitting and tension variations occur, then the result can be a barred effect. Based on the criterion of marledness, 10 experts and 10 inexperienced observers were asked to rank the outcomes in order. These results allow for a better understanding on how to prepare the yarns and knitting process to achieve different degrees of marledness...|$|E

Theory suggests that twist along worsted yarns should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean torque of worsted yarns reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun <b>marl</b> <b>yarns,</b> down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level worsted yarns that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6. The results and theory provide a guide as to the effect the observed large variations in linear density will have on yarn properties such as tenacity and torque. <br /...|$|R
