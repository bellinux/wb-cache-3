Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope.

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on <b>mimivirus,</b> which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

The presence of an arsenal of genes not widespread in the virosphere related to important steps of the translational process, including transfer RNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and translation factors for peptide synthesis, constitutes an important element of this debate.

40|$|Background: <b>Mimiviruses</b> or giant {{viruses that}} infect amoebas {{have the ability}} to retain the Gram stain, which is usually used to colour bacteria.

Guided by these premises, we performed a routine Gram stain on a variety of human specimens {{to see if we could}} detect the same Gram positive blue granules that identify <b>Mimiviruses</b> in the amoebas.  Methods: We analysed 24 different human specimens (liver, brain, kidney, lymph node and ovary) using Gram stain histochemistry, electron microscopy immunogold, high resolution mass spectrometry and protein identification.  Results: We detected in the human cells Gram positive granules that were distinct from bacteria. The fine blue granules displayed the same pattern of the Gram positive granules that diagnose <b>Mimiviruses</b> in the cytoplasm of the amoebas. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of human Mimiviruses-like structures and mass spectrometry identified histone H 4 peptides, which had the same footprints as giant viruses. However, some differences were noted: the Mimivirus-like structures identified in the human cells were ubiquitous and manifested a distinct mammalian retroviral antigenicity.  Conclusions: Our main hypotheses are that the structures could be either giant viruses having a retroviral antigenicity or ancestral cellular components having a viral origin.  However, other possible alternatives have been proposed to explain the nature and function of the newly identified structures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{numerous}} and diverse eukaryotic viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes {{that at least}} partially reproduce in the cytoplasm of infected cells apparently evolved from a single virus ancestor. This major group of viruses is known as Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) or the proposed order Megavirales. Among the “Megavirales”, there are three groups of giant viruses with genomes exceeding 500 kb, namely <b>Mimiviruses,</b> Pithoviruses, and Pandoraviruses that hold the current record of viral genome size, about 2. 5 Mb. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved, ancestral NLCDV genes clearly shows that these three groups of giant viruses have three distinct origins within the “Megavirales”. The <b>Mimiviruses</b> constitute a distinct family that is distantly related to Phycodnaviridae, Pandoraviruses originate from a common ancestor with Coccolithoviruses within the Phycodnaviridae family, and Pithoviruses are related to Iridoviridae and Marseilleviridae. Maximum likelihood reconstruction of gene gain and loss events during {{the evolution of the}} “Megavirales” indicates that each group of giant viruses evolved from viruses with substantially smaller and simpler gene repertoires. Initial phylogenetic analysis of universal genes, such as translation system components, encoded by some giant viruses, in particular <b>Mimiviruses,</b> has led to the hypothesis that giant viruses descend from a fourth, probably extinct domain of cellular life. The results of our comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of giant viruses refute the fourth domain hypothesis and instead indicate that the universal genes have been independently acquired by different giant viruses from their eukaryotic hosts...|$|R
40|$|Giant viruses have {{revealed}} {{a number of}} surprises that challenge conventions on what constitutes a virus. The Samba virus newly isolated in Brazil expands the known distribution of giant <b>mimiviruses</b> to a near-global scale. These viruses, together with the transposon-related virophages that infect them, pose {{a number of questions}} about their evolutionary origins that need to be considered {{in the light of the}} complex entanglement between host, virus and virophage genomes...|$|R
50|$|The {{stages of}} <b>mimivirus</b> {{replication}} {{are not well}} known, but as a minimum {{it is known that}} <b>mimivirus</b> attaches to a chemical receptor on the surface of an amoeba cell and is taken into the cell. Once inside, an eclipse phase begins, in which the virus disappears and all appears normal within the cell. After about 4 hours small accumulations can be seen in areas of the cell. 8 hours after infection many <b>mimivirus</b> virions are clearly visible within the cell. The cell cytoplasm continues to fill with newly synthesised virions, and about 24 hours after initial infection the cell likely bursts open to release the new <b>mimivirus</b> virions.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{strictly}} {{a method of}} classification, <b>Mimivirus</b> joins a group of large viruses known as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). They are all large viruses which share both molecular characteristics and large genomes. The <b>mimivirus</b> genome also possesses 21 genes encoding homologs to proteins which are seen to be highly conserved {{in the majority of}} NCLDVs, and further work suggests that <b>mimivirus</b> is an early divergent of the general NCLDV group.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mimivirus</b> is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Mimiviridae. Amoeba serve as natural hosts.

40|$|International audienceThe Megavirales are a newly {{described}} order {{capable of}} infecting {{different types of}} eukaryotic hosts. For the most part, the natural host is unknown. Several methods {{have been used to}} detect these viruses, with large discrepancies between molecular methods and co-cultures. To isolate giant viruses, we propose the use of different species of amoeba as a cellular support. The aim of this work was to isolate new Brazilian giant viruses by comparing the protozoa Acanthamoeba castellanii, A. polyphaga, A. griffini, and Vermamoeba vermiformis (VV) as a platform for cellular isolation using environmental samples. One hundred samples were collected from 3 different areas in September 2014 in the Pampulha lagoon of Belo Horizonte city, Minas Gerais, Brazil. PCR was used to identify the isolated viruses, along with hemacolor staining, labelling fluorescence and electron microscopy. A total of 69 viruses were isolated.

Culture isolation and metagenome analyses {{have suggested that}} they are common in our environment. By screening metagenomic databases in search of amoebal viruses, we detected virophage-related sequences among sequences generated from the same non-aerated bioreactor metagenome as recently screened by another team for virophage capsid-encoding genes. We describe here the assembled partial genome of a virophage closely related to Zamilon, which infects Acanthamoeba with <b>mimiviruses</b> of lineages B and C but not A. Searches for sequences related to amoebal giant viruses, other Megavirales representatives and virophages were conducted using BLASTx against this bioreactor metagenome (PRJNA 73603). Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses were performed using sequences from previously identified virophages. A total of 72 metagenome contigs generated from the bioreactor were identified as best matching with sequences from Megavirales representatives, mostly Pithovirus sibericum, pandoraviruses and amoebal <b>mimiviruses</b> from three lineages A-C, {{as well as from}} virophages. In addition, a partial genome from a Zamilon-like virophage, we named Zamilon 2, was assembled. This genome has a size of 6, 716 base pairs, corresponding to 39 % of the Zamilon genome, and comprises partial or full-length homologs for 15 Zamilon predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Mean nucleotide and amino acid identities for these 15 Zamilon 2 ORFs with their Zamilon counterparts were 89 % (range, 81 - 96 %) and 91 % (range, 78 - 99 %), respectively. Notably, these ORFs included two encoding a capsid protein and a packaging ATPase.

To explore the dark matter, we used viral RNAP 2 and reconstructed putative ancestral RNAP 2, which were significantly superior in detecting distant clades than current sequences, and we revealed two additional unknown <b>mimiviruses,</b> misclassified as an euryarchaeote and an oomycete plant pathogen, and detected unknown putative viral clades.
