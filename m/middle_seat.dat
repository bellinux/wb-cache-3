25|$|Like its DC-9/MD-80/MD-90 predecessors, the 717 has a 2+3 seating {{arrangement}} {{in the main}} economy class, providing only one <b>middle</b> <b>seat</b> per row, whereas other single-aisle twin jets, such as the Boeing 737 family and the Airbus A320 family, often have 3+3 arrangement with two middle seats per row. Unlike its predecessors, McDonnell Douglas decided not to offer the MD-95/717 with the boarding flexibility of aft airstairs, {{with the goal of}} maximizing fuel efficiency through the reduction and simplification of as much auxiliary equipment as possible.|$|E
25|$|The Economy SkyCouch is {{available}} on the 787-9, 777-200ER and 777-300ER. It is a set of three Economy class seats on the window rows of the cabin that have armrests that retract into the seat back, and full leg rests that individually and manually can be raised to horizontal to form a flat surface extending {{to the back of the}} seats in front. It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the <b>middle</b> <b>seat</b> for 25% more each, can use it as a flat sleeping surface. Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same basic facilities as a standard Pacific Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the leg rests are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.|$|E

5000|$|All Frontier Airlines {{aircraft}} feature [...] "slimline seating". Main cabin {{seats are}} pre-reclined.

At 19" [...] wide the <b>middle</b> <b>seats</b> are wider than the window and aisle seats and, at the time of installation, became the broadest <b>middle</b> <b>seats</b> of any airline in the United States. The switch to slimline seating allowed Frontier to densify the seating, lowering the airline's cost per seat by 30%.|$|R

2500|$|For 2004 both coupe and sedans were altered, with updated {{interiors}} {{and improved}} transmissions. The five-speed automatic transmission on the 350GT Premium now included synchro rev control, while the 6-speed manual transmission {{was made to}} vibrate less. For the sedan, the front grill/bumper, foot panel, head lamp, rear bumper, and rear combination lamps were changed. The front seats received active head rest, while the rear <b>middle</b> <b>seat</b> now have a three-point seat belt as standard. There were also some new wheels and a 19-inch option for the coupé. The Skyline's 2005 update again included changes to the head and rear lamps, front bumper, and side sill protectors. Also, 19-inch aluminium alloy wheel became standard for automatic transmission cars. A [...] "plasma cluster ion" [...] full air conditioner with left/right independent temperature settings, heated door mirrors, head lamp auto levelizer (compliant with new legislation) was made standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|Window {{seats are}} {{located at the}} sides of the aircraft, and usually next to a window, {{although}} some aircraft have seat rows where there is a window missing. Window seats are preferred by passengers who want to have a view, or a wall which they can lean against. Passengers in seats adjacent to the aisle have the advantage of being able to leave the seat without having to clamber over the other passengers, and having an aisle they can stretch their legs into. If a seat block has three or more seats, there will also be <b>middle</b> <b>seats</b> which are unpopular because the passenger is sandwiched between two other passengers without advantages of either window or aisle <b>seats.</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>seats</b> are typically booked last.|$|R
2500|$|The XTBD Devastator, which flew for {{the first}} time on 15 April 1935, marked a large number of [...] "firsts" [...] for the US Navy. It was the first widely used carrier-based {{monoplane}} as well as the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a totally enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings and in these respects the TBD was revolutionary. A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels designed to protrude [...] below the wings to permit a [...] "wheels-up" [...] landing which might limit damage to the aircraft. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the <b>middle</b> <b>seat.</b> During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden Bombsight.|$|E
