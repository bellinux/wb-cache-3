60|$|And {{it is most}} {{singular}} {{that this}} separation, which is the great source of brilliancy in nature, should not only be unobserved, but absolutely forbidden by our great writers on art, who are always talking about connecting the light with the shade by imperceptible gradations. Now so surely as this is done, all sunshine is lost, for imperceptible gradation from light to dark is the characteristic of objects seen out of sunshine, in what is, in landscape, shadow. Nature's principle of getting light is the direct reverse. She will cover her whole landscape with middle tint, in which she will have as many gradations as you please, and a great many {{more than you can}} paint; but on this middle tint she touches her extreme lights, and extreme darks, isolated and sharp, so that the eye goes to them directly, and feels them to be key-notes of the whole composition. And although the dark touches are less attractive than the light ones, it is not because they are less distinct, but because they exhibit nothing; while the bright touches are in parts where everything is seen, and where in consequence the eye goes to rest. But yet the high lights do not exhibit anything in themselves, they are too bright and dazzle the eye; and having no shadows in them, cannot exhibit form, for form can only be seen by shadow of some kind or another. Hence the highest lights and deepest darks agree in this, that nothing is seen in either of them; that both are in exceedingly small quantity, and both are marked and distinct from the <b>middle</b> <b>tones</b> of the landscape--the one by their brilliancy, the other by their sharp edges, even though many of the more energetic middle tints may approach their intensity very closely.|$|E

50|$|Herbert Rose Barraud (24 August 1845 - 1896) was a noted {{portrait}} photographer who had studios in London and Liverpool.

5000|$|Rosa Ponselle {{made her}} Metropolitan Opera debut on November 15, 1918, {{just a few}} days after the Great War had finished, as Leonora in Verdi's La forza del destino, {{opposite}} Caruso. It was her first performance on any opera stage. She was quite intimidated for being in the presence of Caruso, and in spite of an almost paralyzing case of nervousness (which she suffered from throughout her operatic career), she scored a tremendous success, both with the public and with the critics. New York Times critic James Huneker wrote: [...] "...what a promising debut! Added to her personal attractiveness, she possesses a voice of natural beauty that may prove a gold mine; it is vocal gold, anyhow, with its luscious lower and <b>middle</b> <b>tones,</b> dark, rich and ductile, brilliant in the upper register." ...|$|E

50|$|The Impressionists' {{progress}} toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground. By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> in the finished painting. By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour {{a significant role in}} the finished painting.|$|R

50|$|In the chiaroscuro technique, {{multiple}} blocks {{were cut}} and inked with different colors so the resulting print resembles a pen-and-ink sketch. The paper {{served as the}} <b>middle</b> <b>tone,</b> and then highlights (chiara) were added with white gouache, and darkness (scuro) and shadow was created by adding crosshatching in pen or a dark wash with a brush. Woodcuts would consist of a key, or line block, which consisted of the contours and crosshatching and a varying number of tone blocks. The key block sometimes stood alone as {{a black and white}} print. The more blocks, the more tones the final product contained, and the more complex the printing and carving process became.|$|R
