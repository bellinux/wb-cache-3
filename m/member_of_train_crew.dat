5000|$|Immediately {{adjacent}} to the station is the Dinting viaduct where three {{people were killed in}} an accident in September 1855. Another accident south of the station (on the Glossop branch) in 1906 resulted in 20 passengers and 3 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> being injured when two trains were involved in a rear end collision.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 May 1953 three <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> {{were injured}} in a {{collision}} between a freight train and a passenger train that occurred between Forest Gate and Manor Park. A London-bound freight train was crossing over lines when an electric passenger service from [...] ran a red signal and collided with the goods train at a speed of about 35 mph. A Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation report blamed {{the driver of the}} Gidea Park train for his failure to [...] "pay attention to signals".|$|R
50|$|In 1913, Ed Roberts, {{while serving}} as a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> a <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> out <b>of</b> Atlanta, Georgia, was {{involved}} in a train wreck that both crushed his leg and dislocated his hip. Roberts returned to Atlanta to convalesce. Roberts contacted Forrest Adair, a friend, and fellow Masonic Lodge member.|$|R

50|$|Currently, trains {{operate on}} a request-stop basis, whereby if there are {{passengers}} on the platform then the train will halt, but {{if there are no}} passengers the train will continue through without stopping. Passengers wishing to alight at Finghall Lane must inform a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> and they will take action to ensure the train stops at the station. Only two or three out <b>of</b> the ten <b>trains</b> a day actually halt at Finghall Lane, and often this is just to ensure good timekeeping.|$|R

A large area of Viareggio was damaged in the subsequent fires caused by the wagons carrying LPG self-combusting. Twenty-six people {{were reported to have}} been injured in the accident. The accident is the worst rail accident in Italy since the collision between two trains in Murazze di Vado near Bologna on 15 April 1978, which killed 48 people. It was reported that a whole street had been destroyed in the explosion and fire.|$|R
50|$|Since {{nearly the}} {{beginning}} of railroading in North America, the conductor on freight trains rode aboard a caboose, along with the rear flagman and the rear brakeman, and performed duties from there. Advances in technology and pressure to reduce operating costs made cabooses redundant, {{and in most cases}} they have been eliminated. This relocated the conductor from the rear <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> to the locomotive (or locomotives) at the head <b>of</b> the <b>train.</b> In most cases, these same conditions gradually eliminated <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> under the conductorâ€”head and rear brakemen, flagmen, and others.|$|R
2500|$|To receive {{or change}} a train's authority, the train {{dispatcher}} communicate by radio with the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> and gives [...] "mandatory directives" [...] authorizing occupancy in a specified number <b>of</b> blocks. A <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew,</b> usually the conductor, copies the dispatcher's mandatory directive onto a prescribed form. The crew member will repeat the directive {{back to the}} dispatcher, who monitors the repeat for any errors. If the crew member correctly repeats the mandatory directive, the dispatcher finalizes the directive by saying, [...] "That is correct," [...] followed by the dispatcher's initials. A mandatory directive cannot take effect until the dispatcher has said, [...] "That is correct," [...] reducing the potential for human error to cause an accident.|$|R
50|$|The trains were {{supposed}} to cross at the Violet Town crossing loop (where there are two tracks), but because the driver <b>of</b> the passenger <b>train</b> had died <b>of</b> an apparent heart attack approximately 5 to 6 kilometres north of the crossing loop, the train did not stop at the red signals. It continued until it collided head-on with the freight train. At {{the time of the}} accident, neither ATC nor AWS nor ATP were fitted, although a vigilance control system had been fitted to both locomotives. This required a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> to press a button every sixty to ninety seconds; either the driver or fireman/second person could press the buttons.|$|R
50|$|First Plus {{comes with}} more leg room, {{reclining}} seats, tinted windows with blinds, complementary newspapers (on most services {{the two main}} Belfast papers but on occasion the Irish Independent and Irish Times will be available).Food in First Plus comes via a full three-course menu serving breakfast (before 12pm), lunch and dinner (after 12pm). Tea and Coffee from this menu come with complementary refills. First plus is also significantly quieter as it is rare for either First Plus carriage to be full to capacity. A <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> checks passengers tickets {{at the door to}} the first plus carriages, since many people are unaware there are two classes of carriage on the train.|$|R
50|$|The Points Box {{remained}} in use until {{the summer of}} 1970 when the point work of the Port Erin arrival platform and its associated signals were disconnected. These points were then controlled with hand levers and the signals were placed permanently in the 'off' position so that trains could arrive and depart without the box being manned, saving the associated wage costs. Thereafter, it was used only for more complicated shunting movements in which case it would be manned by a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> or the stationmaster. The remainder {{was taken out of}} use in 1979/80 when the old Port Erin Platforms - 5 & 6 - were removed and the area cleared for parking.|$|R
50|$|With {{the coming}} of the railroad, local {{entrepreneur}} Amasa Coleman lobbied for the construction of the station that would take its name from him and give it to the area. He and Oliver Barrett convinced what was by then the New York Central that a separate stop less than two miles (3 km) north of its Sharon station would help it better serve both the vacationers headed for that town across the state line and the farmers. The station spurred the development of a small commercial center around it, almost vanished today. Indian Lake Road was rerouted to {{the east side of the}} line (the original roadbed is still visible near the current overpass) and a rock cut created through the Wheeler-Bassett Farm. In the Great Blizzard of 1888 a five-locomotive plowing team was utterly wrecked when it crashed into snow that had accumulated in the cut. Five <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} report {{had this}} to say about the facts as presented to it; [...] "Much of the evidence submitted relating to the order of events at the crucial time of the destruction of the bridge and <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> and <b>of</b> the conditions about the bridge, including the bed of the river, rests on inferences on which the Board is asked to make findings of fact. It seems unavoidable that the reconstruction of some events and circumstances must rest on such a foundation..." [...] The Board also stated, [...] " ...it is appropriate to record that in respect <b>of</b> every <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> No. 626 and <b>of</b> every <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Way and Works and Traffic Branches whose duties can be regarded as being involved in the accident there has been no failure to exercise reasonable care or fulfill any duty or responsibility reasonably to be expected <b>of</b> that <b>member</b> in the circumstances leading to the accident. The Board thinks this view can properly apply also to Constable Smidt." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that <b>crewing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued {{the use of}} traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting <b>of</b> signals. Two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> support <b>crew</b> were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation <b>of</b> the <b>train.</b> No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|R
50|$|Several {{incidents}} have coloured {{the history}} of the line. On 1 August 1904 the passenger building of Bellegarde station went up in flames, to be rebuilt in 1913. 1922 saw the two biggest incidents on the line, a landslide and a tunnel accident. On 11 April, a huge landslide near Neyrolles station completely cut the line. On June 3 a new alignment was opened. The most difficult operational feature of the line was its longest tunnel, the Mornay tunnel. Over 1300m of the tunnel is at 2.4% gradient; running towards Bellegarde, steam locomotives had to operate at full power, filling the tunnel with smoke. The natural ventilation was poor. In May 1922, 7 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> a <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> were asphyxiated and died. Subsequently a special ventilation plant was opened in 1924, one of only two of it kind in France. It blew air into the tunnel when trains were passing through in the Bourg to Cluse direction.In 1932 a new station was built at le Neyrolles on the new alignment. During the second world war, the line had strategic importance, as {{there was a lot of}} resistance activity in the Ain and on the Jura plateeau. Several bridges were destroyed in 1944, starting with the bridge over the Suran on July 8, followed by the Cize Bolozon viaduct on the 8th and the Reyssouze bridge on 2 September. The Cize Bolozon viaduct was only opened 5 years after the end of the war, on 14 May 1950.|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. Emergency brake valves were (and still are) always located on the bulkheads (end walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency brake valve is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|R
