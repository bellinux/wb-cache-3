5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. <b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> is {{most common}} in females.|$|E
25|$|HLA DR3 is {{correlated}} strongly with Sjögren's syndrome, <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> SLE, and DM Type 1.|$|E
25|$|DQA1*0104:DQB1*0503 {{is part of}} a multigene {{haplotype}} DR14-DQ5 that {{is associated}} with MuSK positive <b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with the}} {{autoimmune}} disease <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> commonly (70%) {{are found to}} have thymic hyperplasia or malignancy.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam is {{contraindicated}} in <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {{and limited}} pulmonary reserve, {{as well as}} severe hepatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{acetylcholine}} receptor antibody level which is typically seen in <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> {{has been seen}} in certain patients of mitochondrial associated ophthalmoplegia.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} {{may be due}} {{to problems}} with the nerve supply, neuromuscular disease (such as <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis)</b> or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes polymyositis and other muscle disorders.|$|E
25|$|More rare manifestations are acute confusional state, Guillain–Barré syndrome, aseptic meningitis, {{autonomic}} disorder, demyelinating syndrome, mononeuropathy (which might manifest as mononeuritis multiplex), {{movement disorder}} (more specifically, chorea), <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> myelopathy, cranial neuropathy and plexopathy.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the FDA {{added two}} box {{warnings}} for this drug {{in reference to}} spontaneous tendon ruptures {{and the fact that}} moxifloxacin may cause worsening of <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.|$|E
25|$|Mega{{esophagus}} is {{a disease}} of the esophagus characterized by low motility and dilation. Most cases in adult dogs are idiopathic. It {{is the most common}} cause of regurgitation in dogs. Other causes of megaesophagus include <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> lead poisoning, and Addison's disease.|$|E
25|$|The thymus gland cells {{form part}} of the body's immune system. In those with <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> the thymus gland is large and abnormal. It {{sometimes}} contains clusters of immune cells which indicate lymphoid hyperplasia, and the thymus gland may give wrong instructions to immune cells.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who suffer}} from muscle {{weakness}} due to <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> or have poor respiratory reserves due to severe chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease, or have sleep apnoea cannot safely take zopiclone, nor can a patient with any untreated abnormality of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|Diseases that impair {{signaling}} between α-MNs and extrafusal muscle fibers, namely {{diseases of}} the neuromuscular junction have similar signs to those that occur with α-MN disease. For example, <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> is an autoimmune disease that prevents signaling across the neuromuscular junction, which results in functional denervation of muscle.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare muscle disorder called <b>Myasthenia</b> <b>Gravis.</b> This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed made her feel ill, with her face appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, Maggie began to notice some symptoms of the disease returning.|$|E
25|$|A dozen {{inflammatory}} {{diseases of}} the immune system can attribute some risk to the haplotype. Some disease like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes. While other diseases, like type 1 diabetes may have several, highly different, genes that attribute risk. Still other diseases, like <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> have undetermined linkage to the haplotype.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> is a {{neuromuscular disease}} leading to {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative {{effect of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.|$|E
25|$|Weakness or {{asthenia}} is {{a symptom}} of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some conditions, such as <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> muscle {{strength}} is normal when resting, but true weakness occurs after the muscle {{has been subjected}} to exercise. This is also true for some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, where objective post-exertion muscle weakness with delayed recovery time has been measured and is a feature of some of the published definitions.|$|E
25|$|A thymoma is a tumor {{originating}} from the epithelial {{cells of the}} thymus that may be benign or malignant. Thymomas are frequently associated with the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> (MG) is a {{long-term}} neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles {{are those of the}} eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> {{is another}} common {{autoimmune}} disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven {{amino acid sequence}} (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the α-subunit that demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross-reactivity of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus {{is associated with the}} initiation of <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> Not only does HSV cause immunologic cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.|$|E
25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> can appear similar to botulism, and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis.</b> A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> is {{generally}} treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, {{may also be}} used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{should be}} used with caution in those with liver {{impairment}} {{and those that are}} soluble in water and urine worsen renal failure (this is not true of the lipid-soluble agents doxycycline and minocycline). They may increase muscle weakness in <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> and exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus. Antacids containing aluminium and calcium reduce the absorption of all tetracyclines, and dairy products reduce absorption greatly for all but minocycline.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is used {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with other immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and other forms of vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, atopic dermatitis, <b>myasthenia</b> <b>gravis,</b> neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), restrictive lung disease, and others. It is also an important therapy and steroid-sparing agent for inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> <b>gravis</b> {{occurs in}} all {{ethnic groups and}} both sexes. It most {{commonly}} affects women under 40 and people from 50 to 70 years old of either sex, {{but it has been}} known to occur at any age. Younger patients rarely have thymoma. The prevalence in the United States is estimated at between 0.5 and 20.4 cases per 100,000, with an estimated 60,000 Americans affected. Within the United Kingdom, an estimated 15 cases of MG occur per 100,000 people.|$|E
