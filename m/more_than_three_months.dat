5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} goodness-of-fit of eight option-based {{approaches}} used to extract risk-neutral probability density functions from a high-frequency CAC 40 index options during a normal and troubled period. Our {{findings show that}} the kernel estimator generates a strong volatility smile {{with respect to the}} moneyness, and the kernel smiles shape varies with the chosen time to maturity. The mixture of log-normals, Edgeworth expansion, hermite polynomials, jump diffusion and Heston models are more in line and have heavier tails than the log-normal distribution. Moreover, according to the goodness of fit criteria we compute, the jump diffusion model provides a much better fit than the other models on the period just-before the crisis for relatively short maturities. However, during this same period, the mixture of log-normal models performs better for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> maturity. Furthermore, in the troubled period and the period just-after the crisis, we find that semi-parametric models are the methods with the best accuracy in fitting observed option prices for all maturities with a minimal difference towards the mixture of log-normals model.

5|$|By 1929 Coward {{was one of}} the world's highest-earning writers, with {{an annual}} income of £50,000, more than £2,000,000 in terms of 2007 values. Coward thrived during the Great Depression, writing a {{succession}} of popular hits. They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher, and the historical extravaganza Cavalcade (1931) at Drury Lane, about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its 1933 film adaptation won the Academy Award for best picture. Coward's intimate-scale hits of the period included Private Lives (1930) and Design for Living (1932). In Private Lives, Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young Laurence Olivier. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> at any venue. Design for Living, written for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, was so risqué, with its theme of bisexuality and a ménage à trois, that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E

The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E

40|$|Background: Sciatic pain in {{association}} with lumbar disc herniation may require surgical intervention {{in the form of}} lumbar discectomy. Yet, the optimal time for this operation has not been specified in medical literature. Methods: In a Cross-sectional study, 147 patients (100 men and 47 women) with radiological and clinical signs of L 4 -L 5 or L 5 -S 1 disc herniation were entered to our registry prior to March 2009. They were all examined, diagnosed and operated on (lumbar discectomy) in Ghaem General Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. Patients were all subsequently followed for one year. The follow-up continued in a number of 126 cases, whose satisfaction was rated via phone interview for an extra year. The patients’ assessments were implemented employing three scaling systems, both before and following lumbar discectomy, to name the Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Prolo Functional Economic Outcome Rating Scale (PORS). The former two were used for pre-operative and post-operative assessments whereas the latter was applied {{during the first year of}} follow-up. The focus of the investigation during second year was on patients’ satisfaction. Results: Mean age of our cases were 34 ± 7. 4 years. According to the duration of the sciatica, patients were divided into 4 groups. < 3 months, 3 to < 6 month, 6 to 12 months. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between patients having undergone lumber discectomy with a history of sciatica for less and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> before the operation in terms of pre-and post-operative visual Analogue Scale (P= 0. 022). However, there could be found no such disparity in other clinical scores (P= 0. 63 for MODI, P= 0. 85 for Prolo scale and P= 0. 73 for satisfaction). Conclusion: Patients with less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of sciatica may seem to enjoy a better clinical outcome after one year, there could be found no correlation between the duration of sciatica and the satisfaction after two years...|$|R
