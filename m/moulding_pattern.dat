30|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of IL, the density and lateral dimension of Si nanostructures are ultimately limited by the wavelength of the incident light [20], an issue common with UV and DUV photolithographies. Furthermore, the cross-sectional shapes and array configurations are constrained to those permitted by interference. While advanced nanolithography techniques such as electron beam lithography (EBL) are capable of realizing feature dimensions down to a few nanometers, and are valuable tools in a research environment, they are not amenable to an industrial high-throughput manufacturing setting [22]. These limitations are circumvented with nanoimprint lithography (NIL) in which the <b>mould</b> <b>pattern</b> can be written by EBL and thus have excellent versatility in pattern design and resolution similar to EBL.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries now assemble {{most of the}} final products they use, but they still need to import most inputs. To escape this dependence, {{developing countries}} are focusing on ways to make more intermediate inputs domestically. But very expensive dies, <b>moulds</b> and castings <b>patterns</b> are required to make most rubber, glass, plastic or metallic components used as intermediate inputs. On the other hand, the machinery and equipment used together with the dies, <b>moulds</b> and <b>patterns</b> can make a wide range to products but are often underutilized. So, often only the dies, <b>moulds,</b> or <b>patterns</b> are needed to begin the production of various components. But, to protect their financial interests, multinational corporations (MNCs) often will not allow a developing country to use these key pieces of equipment without a comprehensive transfer of technology agreement. Hence, often either the developing countries remain import dependent for the components or cannot compete internationally due to their small domestic markets and {{the high cost of}} the dies, <b>moulds</b> and <b>patterns,</b> and hence high per-unit production costs. So, the costs for DMPs must be lowered to economically enable LDCs to deepen import substitution for currently imported intermediate components. These costs might be lowered by: (1) better negotiation with MNCs; (2) joint South-South purchase of DMPs; (3) aid supported guarantees to encourage firms to lend DMPs to LDCs (4) decreasing the number of makes, models, and designs for products; and, (5) improving and subsidizing the facilities to make DMPs locally.

Using the <b>mould</b> <b>pattern</b> {{contrasting}} experiments {{the carrying}} capacities and deformation effects of underground tunnels within soft bed and top or floor strata are studied under high ground pressures in this paper. Through measuring mould strengths and deformation with different stratum and space position {{the relations of}} tunneling positions in different strata with carrying capacity and strains are obtained. It is shown that the soft seam tunneling under high ground pressure can bring about higher secondary stresses and have more acting effects than top or floor tunnels. In the same pressure conditions the carrying capacity of having top tunneling above soft tunnel decreases near 30 % with that of having floor tunnel. The mutual effects with double horizontal spaces of tunnels decrease 25 %.

Among the novel patterns found were arrays of tips distributed fairly regularly over the whole whorl sur-face, as well as striped patterns detected at earlier stages with a tip-specific antigen. These altered patterns dem-onstrate that a whorl's size and shape are by themselves important factors in pattern determination. We have compared the range of observed patterns to those predicted by a variety of different theories.

40|$|Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is {{a single}} cell visible by an unaided eye. The slime mould optimizes its network of protoplasmic tubes in {{gradients}} of attractants and repellents. This behavior is interpreted as computation. Several prototypes of the slime mould computers were designed to solve problems of computation geometry, graphs, transport networks, and to implement universal computing circuits.

The long-range order and variability of nanoscale patterning offered in this approach cannot be achieved by self-organized methods of nanopatterning such as AAO templating, nanosphere lithography, and block copolymer self-assembly. Versatility in nanoimprint <b>mould</b> <b>patterns</b> allows this combinatory method to overcome the shortcomings of interference lithography and yet produce nanoscale features, previously limited to research-scale E-beam lithography or deep UV photolithography, on a wafer scale. The Si nanostructures produced in our approach show a high degree of fidelity as the user-defined SRNIL patterns, and retain non-porous top surfaces due to the substrate adherent, and chemically resistant SRNIL resin mask. This method is capable of producing high aspect ratio structures through a simple inexpensive wet etching setup. Minor lateral sidewall etching which arises from prolonged immersion in the etching solution reduces the dimensions of the Si nanostructures and should be taken into account in the design and fabrication process. Bearing these in mind, our approach could be very useful for large-scale nanostructured device production.|$|R

According to recent estimates, its only population consists of 30 adult individuals and a fluctuating number of juveniles derived from natural regeneration; besides, some hundreds of cultivated plants are preserved as ex situ collection. We used RAPD data from six 10 -mer primers to examine the consequences of extensive historical clearance and human pressures on the extant population. Data from multiple life stages and different habitat conditions were considered, affording an opportunity to ascertain {{for the first time}} the structure of genetic variation in the extant uneven-aged population on both spatial and temporal scale. Consistent with previous works, we found that the history of disturbance and past land use did not affect drastically the biological diversity of the present-day population. Considerable levels of genetic variation were detected both in adult and juvenile sets. The non-significant correlation between genetic and physical distances (Mantel test; r = - 0. 075) revealed a random distribution of genotypes in the natural stand. When the juvenile set was divided in 17 subsets, based on maternal provenance and growing conditions, Shannon's index (54 %) and AMOVA analysis (84 %) indicated that most of genetic variation resides within subsets. Neighbour-joining cluster analysis supported the hypothesis of high crossfertilization rates expected for a woody perennial species; nevertheless some grouping of related individuals suggested partial inbreeding and a weak pattern of genetic structure.

The embossing shows very good replication of the GaAs <b>mould</b> <b>patterning</b> to 1 μm definition, with evidence also for sub-micron replication. For the embossing, thin coatings of the chalcogenide glasses were sputtered onto wafer substrates as follows: (i) a 6 μm layer of Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 (at. %) onto porous Si-on-Si wafer substrates and (ii) a 4 μm layer of Ge 15 As 15 Se 17 Te 53 onto uncoated GaAs substrates. The Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 sputtered glass layer on porous Si-on-Si was demonstrated to slab waveguide at 1. 55 μm wavelength; it was designed to achieve monomode waveguiding at 1. 55 μm after embossing, for the 5 μm wide rib. The series of ribs, 1 – 10 μm wide, were successfully embossed in the Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 glass sputtered layer on porous Si-on-Si, but cracking of the glass layer occurred during the embossing process. Successful embossing of ribs without the glass layer cracking was achieved for the Ge 15 As 15 Se 17 Te 53 sputtered glass layer on uncoated GaAs.

40|$|Purpose: Nano-imprint forming (NIF) is a {{manufacturing}} technology capable of achieving high resolution, low-cost and high-throughput fabrication of fine nano-scale structures and patterns. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to use modelling technologies to simulate key process steps associated with the formation of patterns with sub-micrometer dimensions and use the results to define design rules for optimal imprint forming process. Design/methodology/approach: The effect of a number of process and pattern-related parameters on the quality of the fabricated nano-structures is studied using non-linear finite element analysis. The deformation process of the formable material during the mould pressing step is modelled using contact analysis with large deformations and temperature dependent hyperelastic material behaviour. Finite element analysis with contact interfaces between the mould and the formable material is utilised to study the formation of mechanical, thermal and friction stresses in the pattern. Findings: The imprint pressure, temperature and the aspect ratio of grooves which define the pattern have significant effect on the quality of the formed structures. The optimal imprint pressure for the studied PMMA is identified. It is found that the degree of the <b>mould</b> <b>pattern</b> fulfilment as function of the imprint pressure is non-linear. Critical values for thermal mismatch difference in the CTE between the mould and the substrate causing thermally induced stresses during cooling stage are evaluated. Regions of high stresses in the pattern are also identified. Originality/value: Design rules for minimising the risk of defects such as cracks and shape imperfections commonly observed in NIF-fabricated nano-structures are presented. The modelling approach can be used to provide insights into the optimal imprint process control. This can help to establish further the technology as a viable route for fabrication of nano-scale structures and patterns...|$|R

The project has established an entirely new method for creating glass casting moulds directly from three-dimensional computer drawings {{without the need for}} a physical <b>mould</b> <b>pattern.</b> The method developed is based on Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technology using a three-dimensional printer, a process commonly known as ‘Rapid Tooling’ (RT). The method developed has a number of significant advantages compared with conventional investment casting techniques. The project was instigated as a joint initiative by a glass artist and a designer aiming to explore this research space by combining our tacit knowledge of materials, making processes and digital design technologies While the paper includes a narrative concerning the development of the moulding process,(including a number of technical details) the central argument is rooted in research/innovation methodology. The project, which is on-going, has developed approach based “emergent methodologies” (Bolt 2007), and employs central elements of “reflective practice” (Schon 1983). However, other methodologies, such as empirical testing were also employed during the project. In order to facilitate a way to effectively logging the various data from these investigations, we have developed a database template for a ‘rich media’ research journal.
