50|$|The PlusEnergy {{approach}} uses {{a variety}} of techniques to produce a building that generates more energy than it consumes. A typical example is to capture heat during the day {{in order to reduce the}} need to generate heat over night. This is achieved using large North and South facing window areas to allow sunlight to penetrate the structure, reducing the need for energy use from light bulbs. Triple-paned windows (U-value = 0.7) trap this heat inside, and the addition of heavy insulation then means the structure is already warm in the evening and therefore needs less heating. In the Sun Ship, a 60000 sq ft commercial, retail and residential PlusEnergy structure, techniques such as phase changing materials in the walls and vacuum insulation are also used. This permits <b>maximum</b> <b>availability</b> of floor space without compromising efficient insulation.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has emerged}} as one of the latest technologies for delivering on-demand sophisticated services over the Internet. To make effective use of tremendous capabilities of the cloud, efficient scheduling algorithms are required. While concerning on large scale system, fault tolerance is a very critical issue, since the cloud resources are extensively disseminated among diverse locations. This leads to a higher probability of failures while solving huge problems, thus the cloud service reliability could be relatively low. Therefore, providing an effective fault tolerance technique for a cloud system is mandatory. This paper introduces an efficient and reliable Rule-based Semantic Fault Tolerant Scheduling (RSFTS) technique for Cloud Environment.

A heuristic method is developed to site the ambulances. The models are applied to the 33 -node problem representing Austin, Texas, and the 55 -node problem. For the 33 -node problem, the results show that the servers are less spatially distributed in Q-MALP and MQ-MALP when the uncertainty of server availability is considered using either the independent or dependent travel time. On the other hand, for the 55 -node problem, the spatial distribution of the servers obtained by locating a server to the highest hit node location is more dispersed in MCLP and Q-MALP. The implications of the new model for the ambulance services system design are discussed as well as the limitations of the modeling approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — E-commerce and {{mission-critical}} Internet services {{require a}} <b>maximum</b> of <b>availability</b> {{of the network}} and a minimum of network outage times. Due to the increasing demands to carry mission critical traffic, realtime traffic, and other high priority traffic over the Internet network survivability represents a requirement for the future networks.

This work proposes the use of prioritized resource allocation and preemption for reestablishing connections that have been disrupted by a failure. In this paper we propose a restoration priority scheme based on types of applications which can be mapped to the QoS architecture of wireless networks and DiffServ standards. We investigate the order in which the connections are being restored and the order of restoring the connections and routing within each application type in the presence of dynamic bandwidth allocation.

We examined the impact of this climatic variation on arthropod abundance and phenology, and how these relationships impact reproductive decisions and fitness in an Arctic-breeding passerine, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) using a seven-year dataset from the low Canadian Arctic. Intra- and inter-annual climate-based models yielded significant variation in predictive capacity of arthropod emergence and abundance, limiting their hind- and fore-casting use. At the population level, snow bunting laying decisions appeared constrained by spring temperatures and laying did not appear timed to match nestling peak energy requirements to <b>maximum</b> arthropod <b>availability.</b> However, individual females that timed laying to match peak demand and arthropod abundance had the highest reproductive success, even in low arthropod abundance years.
