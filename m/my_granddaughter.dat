For more on those times check out pacifist Dave Dellinger's book, From Yale to Jail... At any rate, today I'll apologize {{for a number of}} things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a [...] "hard driver" [...] and not a [...] "supremely cruel misleader." [...] I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the Inquisition, the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by Crusaders. White people in the U.S.A. ought to apologize for stealing land from Native Americans and enslaving blacks. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for Genghis Khan. And supporters of Roosevelt could apologize for his support of Somoza, of Southern White Democrats, of Franco Spain, for putting Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Who should <b>my</b> <b>granddaughter</b> Moraya apologize to? She's part African, part European, part Chinese, part Japanese, part Native American. Let's look ahead.|$|E

6000|$|... "Somebody {{must speak}} out," [...] {{the old lady}} began; [...] "and I mean to set the example. Telling the truth," [...] she declared, turning {{severely}} to her daughter, [...] "is a more complicated affair than you seem to think. It's a question of morality, of course; but--in family circles, my dear--it's sometimes a question of convenience as well.

6000|$|... "And that, sir, is {{precisely}} what I am about to relate. Poor child, she was left on my hands by her sainted mother--my daughter, sir--who perished young. Now, her birthplace, where she was taught letters and the Catechism by the priest, was in an unhealthy situation. It was hot and wet--always wet--a place suited to frogs rather than to human beings. At length, thinking that it would suit the child better--for she was pale and weakly--to live in a drier atmosphere among mountains, I brought her to this district. For this, senor, and for all I have done for her, I look for no reward here, but to that place where my daughter has got her foot; not, sir, on the threshold, as you might think, but well inside. For, after all, {{it is to the}} authorities above, in spite of some blots which we see in their administration, that we must look for justice.

5000|$|... ″If I {{have learned}} any lesson from {{having been in}} {{the remains of the}} camps," [...] says Hartmann, ″it is that {{thinking}} or living for oneself alone has become an unaffordable luxury. Except perhaps in dreams, life no longer takes place on a solitary plane. It is now irrevocably complex, and we, whoever we are, have become intertwined one with the other, {{whether we like it or}} not. Acting on that belief may be a more effective tribute to the memory of the dead than mourning alone or vowing that it shall not happen again. And it may also be the most promising way of doing away with the concentration camps. I am not an optimist, but I believe that if we decide that we must link our lives inextricably - that [...] "me" [...] and [...] "them" [...] must be replaced by [...] "us" [...] - we may manage to make a life in which gas chambers will not be used again anywhere and a future in which children, including <b>my</b> <b>granddaughters,</b> will not know what they are.″ ...|$|R
