2500|$|The {{electronically}} controlled line of <b>ME</b> <b>diesel</b> two-stroke engines {{was added}} in 2002 {{with a maximum}} cylinder bore of 108cm. [...] MAN B Diesel, Denmark, employed approximately 2,200 {{at the end of}} 2003 and had 100 GW, or more than 8000 MC engines, in service or on order by 2004.|$|E
40|$|Simulation of Thermal-Mechanical Strength for Marine Engine Piston Using FEA Abstract: This paper {{involves}} {{simulation of}} a 2 -stroke 6 S 35 <b>ME</b> marine <b>diesel</b> engine piston {{to determine its}} temperature field, thermal, mechanical and coupled thermal-mechanical stress. The distribution and magnitudes of the afore-mentioned strength parameters are useful in design, failure analysis and optimization of the engine piston. The piston model was developed in solid-works and imported into ANSYS for preprocessing, loading and post processing. Material model chosen was 10 -node tetrahedral thermal solid 87. The simulation parameters used in this paper were piston material, combustion pressure, inertial effects and temperature. The highest calculated stress was the thermal-mechanical coupled stress and was below the yield stress of the piston material (580 Mpa) at elevated temperatures hence the piston would withstand the induced stresses during work cycles...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2014, Vin Diesel {{confirmed}} work on {{a sequel}} tentatively titled xXx: The Return of Xander Cage. On August 23, 2015, Vin Diesel announced on his Instagram page that [...] "While I was filming xXx, guys on set called <b>me</b> Air <b>Diesel...</b> The time to return has come. Filming starts December in the Philippines. #ILiveForThisShit...". On October 10, 2015, {{it was reported that}} director D.J. Caruso would direct the film. Diesel announced that UFC fighter Conor McGregor was cast in a role and that Jackson will be reprising his role as Gibbons. However, in April 2016 it was announced McGregor had dropped out of his planned appearance to focus on training and the UFC; he was replaced by Michael Bisping. On January 1, 2016, Twitch reported that Tony Jaa, Jet Li and Deepika Padukone were cast in roles. The following week, Nina Dobrev and Ruby Rose were also cast. Dobrev would be playing a witty and sarcastic techie, while Padukone will play a huntress who happens to be Cage’s former lover. Rose will play a sniper. Andrey Ivchenko was confirmed to be another villain in the film as one of the big bads Diesel is set to lock horns with, given that earlier reports revealed Li also joined the threequel as a potential adversary. It started filming later in January 2016 and with schedules in Canada in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, as well as the Dominican Republic and the Philippines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{followed}} by a sequel in 2005, entitled xXx: State of the Union, starring the rapper Ice Cube and directed by Lee Tamahori. Neither Diesel, Cohen, nor XXX creator Rich Wilkes were involved in the sequel, and there were notable differences in both style (less emphasis on extreme sports) and music (rock music was replaced with hip hop and rap). XXX: State of the Union was poorly received by critics. It currently has a rating of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes. The sequel was also a financial failure, making less than expected when compared to the original film. In January 2014, Vin Diesel confirmed work on a sequel tentatively titled xXx: Return of Xander Cage. On August 23, 2015, Vin Diesel announced on his Instagram page that [...] "While I was filming XXX, guys on set called <b>me</b> Air <b>Diesel...</b> The time to return has come.

Diesel announced on his Instagram account that UFC fighter Conor McGregor was cast in a role and Samuel L. Jackson will be reprising his role as Gibbons. In January 2016, Twitch reports that Tony Jaa, Jet Li and Deepika Padukone are cast in roles, Nina Dobrev and Ruby Rose were cast in roles with Dobrev as a witty and sarcastic techie, Padukone as a huntress who happens to be Cage’s former lover and Rose will play a sniper and Li was confirmed in the film as the leader of his own team and will square off against Cage, it's whether he is the ultimate villain of the pic remains to be seen. Andrey Ivchenko was confirmed to be another villain in the film as one of the big bads Diesel is set to lock horns with, given that earlier reports revealed Li also joined the threequel as a potential adversary. On February 12, 2016, reports brought in the news that Jet Li dropped out of the film and was replaced with Donnie Yen {{in the role of the}} main antagonist.|$|R
