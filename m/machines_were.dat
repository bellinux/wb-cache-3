500|$|Broaching <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} simple as {{they only have}} to move the broach in a linear motion at a predetermined speed and provide a means for handling the broach automatically. Most <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> hydraulic, but a few specialty <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> mechanically driven. The <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> distinguished by whether their motion is horizontal or vertical. The choice of <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> primarily dictated by the stroke required. Vertical broaching machines rarely have a stroke longer than [...]|$|R
30|$|Machines have a {{predetermined}} orientation (i.e., <b>machines</b> may <b>be</b> located either horizontally or vertically). The <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> horizontally located if the longer {{side of the}} <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> parallel to the x-axis. On the contrary, the <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> vertically located if the longer side {{is parallel to the}} y-axis.|$|R
50|$|The wool combing <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{invented by}} Edmund Cartwright, the {{inventor}} of the power loom, in Doncaster. It was patented on 1790. This <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> used to arrange and lay parallel by length the fibers of wool, prior to further treatment. The <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> important in the mechanization of the textile industry. The <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> refined by many later inventors.|$|R
5|$|In 1830 Puddletown {{was one of}} {{the places}} in Dorset where {{agricultural}} labourers took part in the Captain Swing riots of southern England, protesting against very low wages and long working hours. Threshing <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> damaged and ricks burned. Wages were raised from about six or seven shillings per week to ten as a result.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 2009, the MTA {{said that}} a tunnel-boring machine broke through the 34th Street station cavern wall. Both tunnel-boring <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> {{scheduled}} to finish the required tunneling {{in the spring of}} 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Union of Postal Workers {{objected to}} the {{automated}} sorting system mainly because the wages of those who ran the new automated <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> much lower {{than those who had}} hand-sorted mail.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to defeat this by generating numbers {{even when the}} <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> not being played, so the player cannot tell where in the sequence they are, even if he knows how the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> programmed.|$|R

5|$|The first <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> {{tested in}} 1989, after which NeXT started selling limited numbers to {{universities}} with a beta {{version of the}} NeXTSTEP operating system installed. Initially the NeXT Computer was targeted at U.S. higher education establishments only, with a base price of $6,500.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} {{computers}} were the massive code breaking machines of the Second World War (such as Z3, ENIAC and Colossus). The latter {{two of these}} <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann.|$|E
5|$|The <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> not all {{straight}} {{copies of}} the ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (often with a chiclet keyboard {{in place of the}} original membrane keyboard). One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper.|$|E

30|$|In essence, the Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> a Java virtual <b>machine,</b> but it <b>is</b> very {{different}} from the general Java virtual machine. The main differences are: (1) the system architecture of the Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> different from the Java virtual machine. The Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> based on virtual registers and the Java virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> based on stack. (2) The instruction set of the Dalvik virtual machine (Dalvik byte code) is also completely different from the Java virtual machine (Java byte code). The Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> the key part of the whole system. In the process of dynamic taint tracking, most taint communication happens in this part.|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} analysis, {{various types}} of multi-tape Turing <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> often used. Multi-tape <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> similar to single-tape <b>machines,</b> but there <b>is</b> some constant k number of independent tapes.|$|R
5|$|The raid was a disaster. Just six <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> {{destroyed}} at Grimbergen for {{the loss}} of 21 Fw 190s and two damaged. Another eight sustained minor damage. Some 17 pilots were missing, eight of whom would survive as prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Tube Alloys {{made its}} {{greatest}} advances in gaseous diffusion technology, and Chadwick had originally {{hoped that the}} pilot plant at least would be built in Britain. Gaseous diffusion technology was devised by Simon and three expatriates, Nicholas Kurti from Hungary, Heinrich Kuhn from Germany, and Henry Arms from the United States, at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment, two two-stage models and two ten-stage models, was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers {{at a cost of}} £150,000 for the four units. Two single-stage <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> later added. Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single-stage machine did not commence until June 1943, and with the two-stage machine until August 1943. The two ten-stage <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> delivered in August and November 1943, but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events.|$|E
5|$|Two other <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> built: {{one for a}} joint British Petroleum/University of London consortium, and {{the other}} for the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton near Oxford. A {{derivative}} system was built by Ferranti for Cambridge University, called the Titan or Atlas 2, which had a different memory organisation, and ran a time-sharing operating system developed by Cambridge Computer Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Work on Phase III {{started in}} 2011, with 2016 being the planned deadline, more than 20 tunnel boring <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> used {{simultaneously}} to expedite the work, {{and the actual}} work was completed in fy2017-2018.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Italy in September 1943, around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft {{were found}} at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into the ZNDH. This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters, as well as six Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters. Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 bombers were also added into the ZNDH. The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20-25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked closely}} with Nobel Prize-winning {{experimental}} physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data their <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> producing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum. In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} the {{manufacture}} of many metal products, {{but it can also be}} used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites. A person who specializes in <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> called a machinist. A room, building, or company where <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> done <b>is</b> called a <b>machine</b> shop. Much of modern-day <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laser {{combined}} <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> {{a complex}} <b>machining</b> method which utilizes the combined effect of {{various forms of}} energy to achieve a material processing.

5|$|Marc Isambard Brunel {{established}} the world's first mass production line at Portsmouth Block Mills making pulley blocks for rigging on the navy's ships. The first <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> installed in January 1803 {{and the final}} set for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. By {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the town had the largest industrial site in the world with a workforce of 8000 and an annual budget of £570,000.|$|E
5|$|Other {{governments were}} {{interested}} in the Do 17. In June 1936, the Yugoslav government ordered 36 Do 17E variants from Germany. The negotiations for a licence were completed on 27 June 1938 for 36 Do 17Ka's at the cost of 1,829,825 Reichsmark (RM). On 18 March 1938, Yugoslavia ordered 16 complete Do 17 Ka-2's and Ka-3's at a cost of 3,316,788 RM. They received the last on 21 April 1939. The <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> from 72-96% complete.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, BART {{has been}} trying to {{modernize}} its system. The fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization; in 2009, fire alarms, fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat rubber tiles were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location of the doorway of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> replaced.|$|E
50|$|Manual or {{semi-automatic}} machines {{offer more}} control of shot quality. Because when {{to cut the}} shot (brew time) is a critical variable, which is often adjusted shot-by-shot, semi-automatic <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> often preferred over automatics, though some <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> automatic. Manual <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> more popular in Europe, where it is more common to drink straight espresso.|$|R
5000|$|Hierarchical state <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> finite state <b>machines</b> whose states {{themselves}} can <b>be</b> other <b>machines.</b> Since a communicating finite state <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> characterized by concurrency, {{the most notable}} trait in a communicating hierarchical state <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency. This had been considered highly suitable as it signifies stronger interaction inside the machine.|$|R
50|$|A Woodworking <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> a <b>machine</b> that <b>is</b> {{intended}} to process wood.
