40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the periodic and semi-periodic variations of luminous O- B- A-type stars, linear nonadiabatic stability analyses for radial and nonradial oscillations have been performed for massive evolutionary models (8 M_ - 90 M_). In addition to radial and nonradial oscillations excited by the kappa-mechanism and strange-mode instability, we discuss the importance of low-degree oscillatory convection (nonadiabatic g^-) modes. Although their kinetic energy is largely confined to the convection zone generated by the Fe opacity peak near 2 × 10 ^ 5 K, the amplitude can emerge to the photosphere and should be observable in a certain effective temperature range. They have periods longer than those of the radial strange modes so that they seem to be responsible for some <b>of</b> the long-period <b>microvariations</b> <b>of</b> LBVs (S Dor variables) and α Cyg variables. Moreover, monotonously unstable radial modes are found in some models whose initial masses are {{greater than or equal to}} 60 M_ with Z= 0. 02.
