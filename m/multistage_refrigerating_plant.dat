40|$|Abstract-With {{a view to}} {{conserve}} energy, the use of azeotropes in a <b>multistage</b> <b>refrigerating</b> system is quite timely. Depending upon the requirement, such a system incorporates conventionally either a water cooled or air cooled condenser. The total operating cost of a refrigerating system with a water cooled condenser comprises the cost of water {{and the cost of}} electricity needed to drive the compressor(s). There is enough potential for research in finding out the ways to achieve maximum coefficient of performance and the least operating cost simultaneously for multistage azeotropic system. However, to avoid overloading of sewage facilities and to comply with municipal codes for the use of water, the water flow rate required in refrigerating system should be minimized. In the present investigation, economic water rates for two stage refrigerating systems, operating on most commonly used azeotropes R- 500 and R- 502, have been searched out over a wide range of operating limits. Such economic rates, if followed, would produce maximum COP and consume minimum power. The effects of controlling variables, e. g. approach, cost ratio etc have also been studied on the heat transfer to condenser, optimum condensing temperature and economic water rate. The results have been presented in tabular form only. Index Terms — Azeotropes, <b>multistage</b> <b>refrigerating,</b> compressors, water cooled condenser. 1...|$|R

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{control systems}} are commonly installed in restaurants, commercial buildings, {{office buildings and}} institutional buildings in Hong Kong. The systems invariably involve the use of fans for moving the air, filters for cleansing, ducts for air distribution, a control system for regulating the amount of heating or cooling automatically and a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>plant</b> connected to the heat exchange surface. The ducts in turn present the possibility of spreading fire and smoke throughout the building or areas served. According to the local Code of Practice for Minimum Fire Service Installations and Equipment [1], when a ventilation or air conditioning control system to a building is provided, it shall stop mechanically induced air movement within a designated fire compartment. In order to fulfil such requirement, the architects and building services engineers will design to install associated equipment of air conditioning control systems to satisfy the relevant fire safety requirements of the local authority, which includes the provision of fire resisting ducting, fire dampers, smoke detectors and fire resisting cables, etc. However, lessons learned from past experience reveal that owners or property management staff of the buildings or covered areas and maintenance contractors will mainly concern the efficiency and energy saving of the systems without paying {{much attention to the}} fire hazards arising from the use of refrigerants. It is also noted that fire or explosion incidents [2] involving air conditioning control systems are often attributed to improper maintenance work conducted by maintenance contractors, such as refilling the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>plant</b> with poor quality refrigerants, recharging refrigerants incompatible with the metal parts of the system, refilling refrigerants at high pressure resulting in bursting of piping and joints, valves contaminated by grease, presence of an ignition source in close proximity of the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>plant,</b> etc. In general, refrigerants present two basic hazards [3], namely toxicity and flammability. Refrigerants mix readily with air and if flammable, may reach flammable concentrations ready to be ignited by an ignition source. As diffusion may not take place rapidly enough to avoid the hazards in the event of leakage, fire or explosion may occur. With reference to a recent fire with explosion incident involving air conditioning control system in a restaurant in Hong Kong, this paper will outline and discuss the fire hazards of refrigerants in air conditioning control systems...|$|R
