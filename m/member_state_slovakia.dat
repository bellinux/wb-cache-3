40|$|The author {{investigates the}} degree of capital market cointegration {{of old and new}} EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> and {{examines}} whether, and to what extent, the global financial crisis had an effect on it. Capital markets are completely integrated if assets of equal risk have identical expected returns, irrespective of the location of the capital market. Therefore the risk that the investor agrees to take in the integrated international market is the result of common factors and {{it is not possible to}} diversify the risk. The degree of financial integration of capital markets can be determined by analyzing the movement of market indices. In this paper the multivariate VAR(5) econometric models were set up and tested in order to analyze the multilateral integration of selected capital markets of developed European countries (Britain and Germany) and selected - new EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Slovakia,</b> Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary). Input data of the model are daily stock market indices (FTSE, DAX, BUX, SAX, PX and SBI 20) for the time period January 2001 to October 2009. The study was conducted in three stages: In the first stage each series index was tested for the presence of unit roots, in order to determine whether the time series was stationary or not (to do this, ADF and Phillips - Perron tests were used). In the second stage multivariate VAR(5) models were set up, to which the Johansen method for determining cointegration was applied. In the third stage of the research process, the dynamics of the integration of underlying capital markets was determined by calculating the relevant λtrace value and dividing it by the critical λ value...|$|R

The fact that their independence was not recognised by Serbia, and consequently also not recognised by five EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (Spain, <b>Slovakia,</b> Romania, Greece and Cyprus), did not prevent the country from continuing its STM programme, which aimed to gradually integrate its national policies on legal, economic and social matters with EU, so that {{at some point in the}} future they would qualify for EU membership.

40|$|The lasting ties of {{cooperation}} and cooperation that have been formed for several decades in the Czechoslovakia-Russia format, and after the «velvet divorce» and Slovakia’s independence and sovereignty in 1993 - in the format Slovakia-Russia prove that Russia has been and still is remains a stable, reliable and strategically important partner of Slovakia {{not only in the}} areas of foreign policy and diplomacy, economic and economic cooperation, education, culture, but also in the energy and non-governmental organizations. The article analyzes in detail the foreign political and economic cooperation of Slovakia and Russia, while taking into account the transformations taking place today in the international arena. In particular, special attention is paid to the position of Slovakia on the Crimean issue and the problem of anti-Russian sanctions, which at the moment are among the most discussed topics regarding not only European political structures, but also EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> including <b>Slovakia.</b> The author proves that the anti-Russian sanctions introduced by the West in 2014 and annually prolonged, after three years showed their senselessness and counterproductive nature, since their main goal - to drive out Russia into the corner of the international arena - was not achieved. The long-term «freezing» of political and economic relations between the West and Russia, on the contrary, caused significant damage to EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> including <b>Slovakia,</b> which is a subcontractor of large states. The negative impact of anti-Russian sanctions and the subsequent imposition of retaliatory sanctions on Russia adversely affected the Slovak economy, primarily because of the «forced» reduction in Slovak exports to Russia. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} the Slovak government is extremely concerned about the current situation and officially expresses interest in the complete cancellation or at least partial easing of anti-Russian sanctions. Analyzing the current situation, the author also draws attention to the personal factor that directly influences the formation of the foreign policy direction of Slovakia in relation to Russia. The analysis is supported by statements of high-ranking political figures and representatives of political forces of Slovakia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural labour is a {{relevant}} factor {{to consider in}} the assessment of rural development policies, and especially complex due to the increasing relevance of mixed on-farm and off-farm work in Europe. Within the EU, there is a marked difference in farm structures between Northern/Western and Southern/Eastern regions, with the average size of holdings much smaller in the latter (with the exception of remaining collective farming in some new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> such as <b>Slovakia</b> and Czech Republic and Eastern Germany). In the latter states, the percentage of population that works in part-time in agriculture is much bigger (more than 80 %) compared to the countries from North-West Europe, and the occupation of the available time represents a must for the development of agricultural exploitations; this process requires, beside the reduction of the population employed in agriculture by attracting it to other sectors, the development of pluriactivity and the part-time employment of exploitations’ members in other non-agricultural activities...|$|R

40|$|With {{the ongoing}} changes in {{development}} of the European Union, also conditions for fi nancial support are changing. For Central Europe, most fi nancial aid comes from Cohesion policies. The same applies {{for the support of}} innovations, which are considered to be a driving force of development. One of the main debates concerning cohesion policy is the issue of “placed based” versus “spatially blind” policies. Their role mainly differs within the area of economic growth. This paper deals with the evaluation of innovation support as a driving force for economic growth from structural funds in two neighbouring EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> – in <b>Slovakia</b> and the Czech Republic. This article provides a picture of what kinds of policies are implemented and how consequently the resources of the European Union are territorially distributed to support innovation. We especially dealt with the question of the support criteria for projects and their role in the implementation of support. Based on this, the paper tries to identify where assistance is concentrated and how the criteria infl uence the geographical distribution of this support. As a result, we found that, despite very similar spatially blind policies in both countries and very similar systems of providing support, they still have very different regional effects. In the Czech Republic, support was allocated to developed regions and high tech sectors to a greater extent. In the Slovak Republic, support was concentrated more on disadvantaged regions and in traditional sectors with lower added value. It shows the need to pay much more attention not only to policy set up, but also to policy implementation...|$|R
