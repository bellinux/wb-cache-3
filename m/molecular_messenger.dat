40|$|AbstractHIFα prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{regulate}} protein levels of the α subunit of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF) under different oxygen levels. PHDs catalyse the conversion of a prolyl residue, molecular oxygen and α-ketoglutarate to hydroxy-prolyl, carbon dioxide and succinate in a reaction dependent on ferrous iron and ascorbate as cofactors. Recently it was shown that pseudo-hypoxia, HIF induction under normoxic conditions, is an important feature of tumours generated {{as a consequence of}} inactivation of the mitochondrial tumour suppressor ‘succinate dehydrogenase’ (SDH). Two models have been proposed to describe the link between SDH inhibition and HIF activation. Both models suggest that a mitochondrial-generated signal leads to the inhibition of PHDs in the cytosol, however, the models differ {{in the nature of the}} proposed messenger. The first model postulates that mitochondrial-generated hydrogen peroxide mediates signal transduction while the second model implicates succinate as the <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> which leaves the mitochondrion and inhibits PHDs in the cytosol.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the alteration of CaMKII autophosphorylation and distribution in rat brain following a single, brief pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure and during PTZ kindling. Total CaMKII subunit (-CaMKII) and -CaMKII phosphorylated at Thr 286 were detected by immunoblot. A large decrease in CaMKII Thr 286 phosphorylation, {{as well as}} CaMKII translocation from particulate to soluble fraction was observed in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus 0. 5 – 4 h after the brief PTZ convulsion. These changes reverted to control values by 12 h. These long-lasting changes in CaMKII autophosphorylation and subcellular distribution after a brief seizure suggested that CaMKII could be involved in carrying forward the signal resulting from brief seizure activity, {{at least for a}} few hours, as would be required for kindling to occur. In PTZ kindled rats, convulsions produced changes in CaMKII Thr 286 phosphorylation and distribution in the same direction and of similar magnitude as after the acute convulsion, but lasting for a much longer time. In fact, reduced Thr 286 phosphorylation of -CaMKII was observed up to 48 h, completely bridging the interval between PTZ injections. Similar, but intermediate changes were found in tissue from rats that were only partially kindled. These results implicate CaMKII as a <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> in the acquisition of PTZ kindling...|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> {{involved}} in several events of synaptic plasticity {{in the central}} nervous system. Ca 2 + influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) triggers the synthesis of NO by activating the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in postsynaptic densities. Therefore, NMDAR and nNOS {{are part of the}} intricate scenario of postsynaptic densities. In the present study, we hypothesized that the intracellular distribution of nNOS in the neurons of superior colliculus (SC) superficial layers is an NMDAR activity-dependent process. We used osmotic minipumps to promote chronic blockade of the receptors with the pharmacological agent MK- 801 in the SC of 7 adult rats. The effective blockade of NMDAR was assessed by changes in the protein level of the immediate early gene NGFI-A, which is a well-known NMDAR activity-dependent expressing transcription factor. Upon chronic infusion of MK- 801, a decrease of 47 % in the number of cells expressing NGFI-A was observed in the SC of treated animals. Additionally, the filled dendritic extent by the histochemical product of nicotinamide adenine di-nucleotide phosphate diaphorase was reduced by 45 % when compared to the contralateral SC of the same animals and by 64 % when compared to the SC of control animals. We conclude that the proper intracellular localization of nNOS in the retinorecipient layers of SC depends on NMDAR activation. These results are consistent with the view that the participation of NO in the physiological and plastic events of the central nervous system might be closely related to an NMDAR activity-dependent function...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that nitric oxide (NO), which was first {{identified as a}} unique diffusible <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> in animals, {{plays an important role}} in diverse physiological processes in plants. Recent progress that has deepened our understanding of NO signalling functions in plants, with special emphasis on defence signalling, is discussed here. Several studies, based on plants with altered NO-levels, have recently provided genetic evidence for the importance of NO in gene induction. For a general overview of which gene expression levels are altered by NO, two studies, involving large-scale transcriptional analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana using custom-made or commercial DNA-microarrays, were performed. Furthermore, a comprehensive transcript profiling by cDNA-amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) revealed a number of Arabidopsis thaliana genes that are involved in signal transduction, disease resistance and stress response, photosynthesis, cellular transport, and basic metabolism. In addition, NO affects the expression of numerous genes in other plant species such as tobacco or soybean. The NO-dependent intracellular signalling pathway(s) that lead to the activation or suppression of these genes have not yet been defined. Several lines of evidence point to an interrelationship between NO and salicylic acid (SA) in plant defence. Recent evidence suggests that NO also plays a role in the wounding/jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway. NO donors affect both wounding-induced H 2 O 2 synthesis and wounding- or JA-induced expression of defence genes. One of the major challenges ahead is to determine how the correct specific response is evoked, despite shared use of the NO signal and, in some cases, its downstream second messengers...|$|E
40|$|RNA is a <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> of the cell, {{essential}} to many cellular pathways and processes. In {{order to maintain}} functionality, RNA is processed and modified by protein complexes such as the exosome and associated proteins. The exosome-mediated RNA processing or degradation both require a Ski- 2 like helicase to function. One such helicase is the Frequency-interacting RNA Helicase (FRH), an essential RNA helicase from Neurospora Crassa. FRH is homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mtr 4 from the Ski 2 -like family of RNA helicases. Sequence alignments between FRH and Ski 2 -like family helicases predicted FRH to share the helicase core domains and the inserted arch domain a characteristic of the Mtr 4 -like proteins in this protein family. FRH is also a main component of the circadian oscillation pathway in N. crassa. The participation of FRH in circadian oscillation is not a shared role across RNA helicases. FRH forms a link between two major cellular pathways providing a unique system to study RNA surveillance. Here we present the 3. 51 Å and 3. 25 Å crystal structures of FRH which supports structural prediction by maintaining the core architecture found in Ski 2 -like helicases. These similarities are accompanied by significant flexibility of the arch domain and revealed a unique homodimer. Other known Ski 2 -like helicases have not been observed to form dimers and function biologically as monomers. Furthermore, the initial characterization of helicase activity of FRH on a poly-adenylated RNA substrate is presented.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. In {{recent years}} {{polycyclic}} compounds {{have been shown}} to exhibit pharmacological profiles of importance in the symptomatic and proposed curative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (e. g. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease). These structures also show modification and improvement of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in current use. The use of fluorescent techniques have found widespread applicability in receptor pharmacology and offers an attractive alternative to the use of radioligand studies such as multicolor detection, stability, sensitivity, low hazard and lower cost. Fluorescent ligands can be used to determine receptor properties like receptor internalization and sub-cellular localization, the thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand binding and to assess the nature of the microenvironment of the ligand binding sites. Nitric oxide (NO) is a <b>molecular</b> <b>messenger</b> involved in a number of physiological processes in mammalians. It is synthesised by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) from L-arginine and its overproduction could lead to a number of neurological disorders. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise a series of novel indazole, indole and other fluorescent derivatives conjugated to polycyclic structures for evaluation in NOS assays. NOS is a target system where fluorescent techniques and fluorescently labelled NOS inhibitors, such as 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI), can be used for detecting the biophysical properties of enzyme-ligand interactions and thus facilitate development of novel inhibitors of neurodegeneration. This could lead to a greater insight into the neuroprotective mechanism and a possible cure/treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. A series of compounds incorporating polycyclic structures such as 3 -hydroxy- 4 -aza- 8 -oxoheptacyclo[9. 4. 1. 02, 10. 03 ' 14. 04 ' 9. 09 ' 13. 012 ' 15]tetradecane and amantadine as well as suitable fluorescent moieties were selected for synthesis. The polycyclic structures were conjugated to the fluorescent moieties by amination and esterfication or amidation using activation chemistry with the carbodiimides, CDI and DCC. The fluorescent groups were selected on the basis of their spectroscopic properties, ease of synthesis and structure-activity relationship requirements for NOS inhibition. The groups included TV-methylanthranilic acid, indazole- 3 -carboxylic acid, l-fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene, 1 -cyanoisoindole, 1 -thiocyanatisoindoleand 1 -nitroisoindole. In the biological evaluation the oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) assay was employed to determine the activity of the novel compounds at an enzymatic level of NOS. This assay is principally based on the reaction of NO with oxyHb and the formation of methemoglobin (metHb). The slope of the absorption difference between 401 nm and 421 nm versus time is an indication of NOS activity. From this inhibition data the IC 50 values were calculated and compared. The compounds showed inhibition of the NOS enzyme at a micro molar range. Of the compounds that were tested, only the isoindole and indazole compounds showed significant inhibition at low concentrations. 100 % enzyme inhibition could not be achieved, because of solubility problems. The polycyclic structures conjugated to the indazole moiety increased the NOS activities, when compared to the unconjugated indazole- 3 -carboxylic acid. The anthranilic and dinitrobenzene derivitaves only showed low or no inhibition of the NOS enzyme. 3 -{ 4 -aza- 8 -oxo-heptacyclo[0. 4. 1. 02 J 0. 03 ' 14. 04 ' 9. 09 ' 13. 012 ' 15]tetradecyl}-l/f-indazole- 3 -car-boxylate and 7 V-(l-cyano- 2 i/-isoindol- 2 yl) adamantan-l-amine gave the best inhibition at a concentration of 250 uM, inhibiting the enzyme 83. 7 % and 89. 9 %, respectively. The compounds containing indole and indazole systems clearly have higher affinity for the NOS enzyme than other structures evaluated in this study. We have thus identified a series of fluorescent structures with moderately high affinity for the NOS enzyme, which may be utilized for further in vitro and in vivo studies using modern imaging techniques. In view of the increase in lipophilicity originating from the pentacycloundecyl cage structure, it is expected that the new structures will display an increase in blood brain barrier permeability when compared to 7 -NI. The novel compounds also represent a new class of NOS inhibitors and provide the foundation for potential therapeutic agents. These compounds thus have potential as useful pharmacological tools to investigate enzyme-ligand interactions in the quest for effective neuroprotective strategies. Master...|$|E

Several branches of evolutionary biology, particularly those focusing on ageing, immunological and sexual selection theory, have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as profound evolutionary players. ROS are a highly reactive group of oxygen-containing molecules, generated as common by-products of vital oxidative enzyme complexes. Both animals and plants appear to intentionally harness ROS for use as <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers</b> to fulfil a wide range of essential biological processes.

Cx 31 is expressed in differentiating keratinocytes in skin. Here, we also demonstrate endogenous Cx 31 expression in human neuronal cell lines, particularly in differentiated neurones. Exogenous Cx 31 expression induced neurite outgrowth in human neuronal cell lines, but not differentiation in primary human keratinocytes. Though neither the neuropathy and hearing loss mutation (66 delD) Cx 31 nor the skin disease associated mutation (R 42 P) Cx 31 is able to traffic to the plasma membrane, the R 42 P mutant induced neurite outgrowth to a level equal to wild-type Cx 31.

40|$|AbstractComplex {{networks}} of biochemical reactions, such as intracellular protein signaling pathways and genetic networks, are often conceptualized {{in terms of}} modules—semiindependent collections of components that perform a well-defined function and which may be incorporated in multiple pathways. However, due to sequestration of <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers</b> during interactions and other effects, collectively referred to as retroactivity, real biochemical systems do not exhibit perfect modularity. Biochemical signaling pathways can be insulated from impedance and competition effects, which inhibit modularity, through enzymatic futile cycles that consume energy, typically {{in the form of}} ATP. We hypothesize that better insulation necessarily requires higher energy consumption. We test this hypothesis through a combined theoretical and computational analysis of a simplified physical model of covalent cycles, using two innovative measures of insulation, as well as a possible new way to characterize optimal insulation through the balancing of these two measures in a Pareto sense. Our results indicate that indeed better insulation requires more energy. While insulation may facilitate evolution by enabling a modular plug-and-play interconnection architecture, allowing for the creation of new behaviors by adding targets to existing pathways, our work suggests that this potential benefit must be balanced against the metabolic costs of insulation necessarily incurred in not affecting the behavior of existing processes...|$|R

We discovered that hypertrophied bladders of rat and human contain significantly more nerve growth factor (NGF) per milligram wet weight, protein, and DNA than normal bladders. The temporal correlation between NGF content, neuronal hypertrophy, and bladder weight was consistent with a role for this growth factor in the neurotrophic effects associated with obstruction. Autoimmunity to NGF abolished the hypertrophy of NGF-sensitive bladder neurons in the pelvic ganglion after obstruction. Relief of urethral obstruction reduced bladder size (349 +/- 78 mg), but neuronal hypertrophy (460. 2 +/- 10. 2 microns 2) and elevated NGF levels were only partially reversed. Bladder hypertrophy (133 +/- 4. 3 mg) induced by osmotic diuresis slightly increased ganglion cell area (365. 2 +/- 6. 1 microns 2) and only doubled NGF content of the bladder.

40|$|Bystander effects {{describe}} {{the effects of}} extracellular mediators from irradiated cells on neighbouring non-irradiated cells resulting in radiation-induced effects in unirradiated cells. Although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, it is widely recognised that two types of cellular communication (i. e. via gap junctions and/or release of <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers</b> into the extracellular environment) play an essential role. Additionally, the effects can be significantly modulated by parameters such as cell type, cell-cycle stage and cell density. Some of the common bystander effects or biological end points which are evidenced after low-dose irradiation are: chromosomal instability, cell killing and delayed cell death, mutagenesis, micronucleus formation, gene and protein expression changes. Through these end points {{it is likely that}} bystander effects can be both detrimental and beneficial. By increasing mutation levels of cells bystander effects increase the likelihood of genetic defects and in turn cancer. On the other hand by removing damaged cells from the population and preventing the growth of cancer cells, bystander effects are beneficial. Radiation hormesis is a term used to relate the beneficial effects of small doses of radiation on living cells, whether plant, animal or human. Experiments on bacteria, plants and animals have demonstrated that several biological mechanisms are stimulated by low dose radiation, such as: protein synthesis, gene activation, detoxication of free radicals and stimulation of the immune system. These mechanisms were also observed in humans.

40|$|Cellular {{signaling}} is {{a complex}} system of communication that regulates cell function {{through a variety of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers.</b> When cell survival is threatened by changes in environment or by malfunction of internal regulatory pathways, signals are initiated to restore homeostasis. Deficient protein processing within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes an accumulation of misfolded proteins and stress signaling. The resulting stress signaling includes both adaptive signals (unfolded protein response) and in cases of severe ER stress apoptotic signals induced via the mitochondria. FKBP 10 is a key ER luminal peptidy-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) that mediates protein folding. The production of chaperone proteins and foldases typically increases following the activation of ER stress signaling. However, within 6 - 12 hours of ER stress induction, FKBP 10 protein levels decrease dramatically. Cell fractionation studies revealed FKBP 10 fragments to appear in the cytosol during ER stress. Imaging confirmed decreased ER localization following ER stress. Both calpain and the proteasome were shown to be active in our cells and required for the rapid proteolysis of FKBP 10. These data lead us to a model of FKBP 10 destruction in which FKBP 10 or its cleavage product is retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol as it is destroyed. An examination {{of the structure of the}} FKBP 10 protein revealed two calcium binding EFhand domains near the C-terminus. As the ER lumen is a critical site of cellular calcium storage and ER calcium stores are known to decrease with ER stress, we have chosen to examine the importance of these EF-hand domains in FKBP 10 stability by mutagenizing the putative calcium binding amino acids in a recombinant FKBP 10 clone. Mutant constructs have been generated and calcium binding dependence of FKBP 10 has been analyzed.

In theoretical neuroscience probabilistic approaches have received a growing interest recently, as they account for the ability to reason with incomplete knowledge and to efficiently describe perceptive and behavioral tasks. How can the probability distributions that need to be estimated in these models be represented and processed in the brain, in particular at the single cell level? We consider the basic function carried out by photoreceptor cells which consists in detecting {{the presence or absence of}} light. We give a system-level understanding of the process of phototransduction based on a bayesian formalism: we show that the process of phototransduction is equivalent to a temporal probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), for estimating the presence or absence of light. Thus, the biochemical mechanisms of phototransduction underlie the estimation of the current state probability distribution of the presence of light. A classical descriptive model describes the interactions between the different <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers,</b> ions, enzymes and channel proteins occuring within the photoreceptor by a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations. In contrast, the probabilistic HMM model is described by a discrete recurrence equation. It appears that the binary HMM has a general solution in the case of constant input. This allows a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the system. The biochemical system and the HMM behave similarly under steady-state conditions. Consequently a formal equivalence can be found between the biochemical system and the HMM. Numerical simulations further extend the results to the dynamic case and to noisy input. All in all, we have derived a probabilistic model equivalent to a classical descriptive model of photransduction, which has the additional advantage of assigning a function to phototransduction. The example of phototransduction shows how simple biochemical interactions underlie simple probabilistic inferences...|$|R
30|$|In {{molecular}} clouds, {{many kinds}} of ices such as H 2 O, CO, CO 2, CH 3 OH have been detected (e.g., Gibb et al., 2000). These ices are condensed onto pre-existent grains. In these ices, some chemical reactions and ultraviolet photolysis (and cosmic rays) process the material and may make it refractory. As a result, so-called ‘core-mantle grains’ coated by refractory organics would be formed (e.g., Li and Greenberg, 1997). Indeed, such a grain {{has been found in}} cometary dust: olivine particles produced by a Type II SN coated by organic matter which seems to be formed in a cold <b>molecular</b> cloud (<b>Messenger</b> et al., 2005). Therefore, the ISM dust probably has core-mantle or layered structures. Moreover, the composition can be heterogeneous: for example, graphite coated by silicate, silicate coated by graphite, silicate coated by iron, etc. The formation of such grains {{does not seem to be}} studied well. Much more experimental and theoretical work is highly encouraged.|$|R
40|$|Immune {{responses}} are regulated by an intricate balance between cytokine production {{and actions of}} various immune cell types. Cytokines are key regulators {{of the immune system}} and represent <b>molecular</b> <b>messengers</b> that provide extrinsic cues that direct the genesis of an immune response and its ultimate down-regulation. Here, I aim to characterize two cytokines that play distinct roles in the development of humoral immune responses. First, I describe a novel B cell cytokine, Interleukin 40 (IL- 40) that is expressed in hematopoetic tissues (fetal liver and bone marrow) and by a lymphocyte population not regularly associated with cytokine secretion (activated B cells). Interestingly, the IL- 40 gene is only present in mammalian genomes, indicating that it may participate in a mammalian-specific immune function. One such mammalian specific function which is also immune related is the process of lactation. The mammary gland undergoes extensive remodeling upon the onset of lactation. Milk ducts become defined to transport milk and the immune microenvironment undergoes significant changes that lead to the production of IgA. Importantly, IL- 40 is up-regulated immediate after lactation. An IL- 40 deficient mouse (Il- 40 -/- mouse), exhibits an altered B cell phenotype, reduced serum and mucosal IgA, and a blunted response to HI-VACV (heat-inactivated vaccinia virus). I next focus on CCL 28, a mucosal chemotactic cytokine. CCL 28 is responsible for the recruitment of IgA secreting cells to mucosal sites via its receptor CCR 10. Additionally, CCL 28 is a potent antimicrobial peptide that can inhibit gram positive/gram negative bacteria, and C. albicans. Here, I functionally characterize the first mouse with a targeted deletion of the Ccl 28 gene, (Ccl 28 -/- mouse). The Ccl 28 -/- mouse exhibits altered levels of IgA in mucosal secretions, and high susceptibility to salmonella infection. Overall, I have functionally characterized two distinct cytokine knock-out mouse models, IL- 40 and CCL 28. I predict that through my doctoral work I have laid the foundation for {{a better understanding of the}} role that these two cytokines play in the fields of B cell biology, cytokine discovery, mucosal immunology and the pathogenesis of mucosal infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytochrome}} B (PHYB) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana {{was introduced}} into cotton through Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Integration and expression of PHYB gene in cotton plants were confirmed by <b>molecular</b> evidence. <b>Messenger</b> RNA (mRNA) expression {{in one of}} the transgenic lines, QCC 11, was much higher than those of control and other transgenic lines. Transgenic cotton plants showed more than a two-fold increase in photosynthetic rate and more than a four-fold increase in transpiration rate and stomatal conductance. The increase in photosynthetic rate led to a 46 % increase in relative growth rate and an 18 % increase in net assimilation rate. Data recorded up to two generations, both in the greenhouse and in the field, revealed that overexpression of Arabidopsis thaliana PHYB gene in transgenic cotton plants resulted in an increase in the production of cotton by improving the cotton plant growth, with 35 % more yield. Moreover, the presence of the Arabidopsis thaliana PHYB gene caused pleiotropic effects like semi-dwarfism, decrease in apical dominance, and increase in boll size...|$|R

In previous studies, {{it has been}} demonstrated that the increasingly antibiotic-resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can detect the human hormones brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) at micromolar concentrations. In response, the bacterium modifies its behavior {{to adapt to the}} host physiology, increasing its overall virulence. The possibility of identifying the bacterial sensor for these hormones and interfering with this sensing mechanism offers an exciting opportunity to directly affect the infection process. Here, we show that BNP and CNP strongly decrease P.  aeruginosa biofilm formation. Isatin, an antagonist of human natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR), prevents this effect. Furthermore, the human NPR-C receptor agonist cANF(4 - 23) mimics the effects of natriuretic peptides on P.  aeruginosa, while sANP, the NPR-A receptor agonist, appears to be weakly active. We show in silico that NPR-C, a preferential CNP receptor, and the P.  aeruginosa protein AmiC have similar three-dimensional (3 D) structures and that both CNP and isatin bind to AmiC. We demonstrate that CNP acts as an AmiC agonist, enhancing the expression of the ami operon in P.  aeruginosa. Binding of CNP and NPR-C agonists to AmiC was confirmed by microscale thermophoresis. Finally, using an amiC mutant strain, we demonstrated that AmiC is essential for CNP effects on biofilm formation. In conclusion, the AmiC bacterial sensor possesses structural and pharmacological profiles {{similar to those of the}} human NPR-C receptor and appears to be a bacterial receptor for human hormones that enables P.  aeruginosa to modulate biofilm expression. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly dangerous opportunist pathogen for immunocompromised hosts, especially cystic fibrosis patients.

We showed that AmiC could bind specifically CNP. These results show for the first time that a human hormone could be sensed by bacteria through a specific protein, which is an ortholog of the human receptor NPR-C.

The translation in the oocytes was much more efficient, giving approximately 500 times higher titers of interferon activity than the cell-free systems. A control messenger RNA isolated from noninduced human fibroblasts, did not code for interferon synthesis in these systems. Both messenger RNA preparations stimulated [3 H]amino-acid incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. The radioactive products and their immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. The products resulting from the translation of the control (uninduced) messenger RNA in oocytes contained a major protein of approximately 45, 000 <b>molecular</b> weight. The <b>messenger</b> RNA isolated from poly(rI) -poly(rC) -induced cells stimulated the synthesis of an additional 25, 000 molecular weight protein that electrophoresed in the same position as human fibroblast interferon.
