40|$|DESPITE {{the fact}} that copper sulfate is widely used for the {{prevention}} and treatment of moniliasis in poultry, several reports show that it is actually of little value in this disease. Blaxland and Fincham (19 S 0), after surveying moniliasis in poul-try raised in Great Britain, reported no beneficial effects from copper sulfate ther-apy. More recently, Underwood et al. (1956) reported that copper sulfate ad-ministered in the feed or water was ineffec-tive for preventing and treating the disease in chicks and poults. In two of five trials the use of copper sulfate apparently re-sulted in a more favorable environment in the crop for establishment of Candida albi-cans infection. In an experiment conducted at The Squibb Institute, copper sulfate at a dilution of 1 to 2000 in the drinking water was ineffective in preventing moniliasis in turkey poults. <b>Mycostatin,</b> an antifungal antibiotic, has been used successfully {{in the treatment of}} mycotic diseases of humans.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how pimaricin and <b>mycostatin</b> improved the keeping quality of cottage cheese. The specific objectives were as follows: (1) to develop a method for the determination of pimaricin and <b>mycostatin</b> in cottage cheese, (2) to determine the stability of the antibiotics in the cheese, (3) to determine the effect of the antibiotics upon the sugar utilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and (4) to determine the effect of these antibiotics upon lipolytic microorganisms. Warburg technique trials were made to determine the residual concentrations of the antibiotics in cheese, washed with antibiotic solution, and to determine the stability of the antibiotics during storage at 40 °, 50 °, or 60 °F. In general, the cheeses with the higher concentration of antibiotics and held at the lower storage temperature had the maximum stability. It was observed that <b>mycostatin</b> was less stable and lost its potency more rapidly at the higher storage temperature than pimaricin. The antibiotics retarded the fungal growth and spoilage of cottage cheese. The cheese stored at lower temperature and containing higher concentration of antibiotics had the best keeping quality. A comparison of endogenous oxygen consumption, and the aerobic utilization of lactose, glucose, and galactose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the presence and absence of the antibiotics showed that both of these processes are inhibited by the antibiotics. The results showed that the antibiotics blocked the metabolism of the three sugars approximately at the same extent indicating that the three sugars are metabolized by somewhat similar processes by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also, it appears that the inhibition of the growth Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by the antibiotics, may be directly related to the inhibition of the sugar utilization. The antibiotics exhibited extremely mild inhibitory effects upon the cell production of the culture. The microbial lipase was shown to be inhibited by the antibiotics. In general, it was found that pimaricin and <b>mycostatin</b> increased the shelf-life of cottage cheese. The antibiotics seem to be more effective in retarding the spoilage of cheese when added through cream dressing than when added through wash water. In the latter case, the antibiotics are probably retained in cheese by their being adsorbed upon the cheese proteins. The keeping quality of the cheese was maximum at lower temperatures (40 °F.) presumably because the antibiotics were more stable at that temperature. Advisor: Khem M. Shahan...|$|E
40|$|A 36 -year-old female was {{admitted}} to hospital for debridement of chronically inflamed tendon sheaths and adjacent tissues near the left ankle. Despite antibiotic therapy and initial surgical interventions, the inflammation had progressed slowly over 16 months. Histopathological examination of excised tissues in September 1973 revealed a chronic granulomatous inflammation of tendon sheaths and muscle. Many branched hyphal segments, intercalary swollen cells, and a few conidia-like bodies were seen in sections, and also in KOH- and PAS-stained slides prepared from homogenized tissues. Culture of homogenized tissues yielded pure colonies of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Sensitivity tests were initially begun with amphotericin B, potassium iodide, and potassium tartrate (0 · 05 - 15 μg/ml of the phytone-yeast extract agar), and no inhibitory effect was observed.

The abundance and distribution of Perkinsus marinus in the oyster-producing bays of the Texas coast was determined from Nov. 1987 through Nov. 1988. Oysters were collected from five oyster-producing bays in Texas by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel and tested for infection on a quarterly basis. Infection rates averaged over the five sampling periods for three of the bays tested; Galveston Bay (prevalence 52 %), Matagorda Bay (prevalence = 78 %), and Aransas Bay (prevalence 84 %); showed increases with increasing temperature (21 'C, 21 'C, and 23 'C respectively) and salinity (1 8 ppt, 28 ppt, and 22 ppt respectively). Explanations are offered for the deviations from this trend by the other two bays; Sabine Lake which had the highest infection levels (prevalence = 87 %) with low temperature (21 C) and the lowest salinity (14 ppt), and South Bay which had the lowest infection rate (prevalence = 34 %) with the highest temperature (25 C) and salinity (37 ppt). The relationships of infection rates with environmental conditions at the time of sampling are examined. Variations in the culture technique were also tried in order to compare the usefulness of two new antibiotics, Kanamycin and Gentocin, as replacements for the chloromycetin used in the current mycostatin/chloromycetin method. This work has provided information on alternative antibiotic combinations, some of which enhance the detection of Perkirisus infection more than the current mycostatin/chloromycetin method. In this study, Gentocin, at 800 ppm, was found to enhance detection 16 % above the level of the current method.

40|$|Background : Oral candidosis is an {{infection}} caused by mainly Candida albicans. Candida species are common normal flora {{in the oral}} cavity and {{have been reported to}} be present in 40 % to 60 % of the population. Candida is predominantly an opportunistic infectious agent. Infection frequency has increased {{because of the presence of}} both local and systemic risk factors. The elderly age and diabetes mellitus may decrease the amount of saliva (xerostomia) and potentially increase the risk of colonization and secondary infection by Candida. Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a manifestation of the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. It is characterized by unilateral, painful, vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution. The clinical manifestations of this disease can erupt to the skin and mucous membrane. If maxillary nerve is involved, the lesion can appear on unilateral facial skin and oral mucous membrane. Purpose : The purpose of this paper is to report and discuss the difficulties in managing the oral candidosis in elderly patient (57 year old male) who suffered from maxillary Herpes Zoster and diabetes mellitus. Case management : At first, the patient was treated with 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate and <b>mycostatin</b> oral suspension as topical antimycotic and reffered to dermathology clinic for viral infection treatment, however the oral candidosis did not improved.

Until this fungus was found to infect this pest, no organism which seemed to offer promise of control had been discovered. Symphylan populations were exposed to E. coronata and the pathology followed. When new syrnphylans were added to an infected culture as the diseased individuals died, an epizootic condition developed to {{a point at which}} symphylans were infected and killed in less than two days. E. coronata survived in contaminated containers for as much as five months without susceptible hosts as evidenced by infection of reintroduced symphylans. Wax moth larvae, Galleria, and European house crickets showed high mortality when injected with spores suspended in physiological saline solution. Wax moth larvae and mealworms, Tenebrio, were infected when they were dusted with spores and incubated at 15 °C temperature in high humidity. Penetration of the cuticle by germ tubes from attached spores is the usual pathway of infection. Temperature ranges for both organisms correspond closely. Both become active a few degrees above freezing and reach an optimum between 20 ° and 30 °C. Lethal temperature for both is somewhat below 37 °C.

The patient recovered on systemic antifungal therapy, and vitreous surgery was not required. Endogenous candida endophthalmitis is being encountered with increasing frequency as an opportunistic infection. ' We describe herein {{a case in which}} the clinical diagnosis was supported by isolation of the yeast from culture of a costochondral abscess. The risks and complications of vitreous surgery were thereby obviated and the infection responded well to medical management. Case report A 51 -year-old man with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus developed floaters and blurred vision in his right eye. His ophthalmologist, noting the presence of vitreous debris in the right fundus, administered a retrobulbar steroid injection and prescribed 1 % prednisolone acetate drops every 2 hours. However, vision continued to deteriorate and he was admitted to Vanderbilt University Hospital. He was on chronic prednisolone therapy by mouth and had been treated intermittently with ampho-tericin and <b>Mycostatin</b> (nystatin) for oral candidiasis. A previous episode of staphylococcal infection in his left knee had responded to a prolonged course of methicillin 3 months earlier. There was no history of intravenous drug abuse. On admission the best corrected visual acuity was 6 / 18 right eye and 6 / 6 left eye. Biomicroscopy revealed a trace flare in the right anterior chamber.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Methods {{examined}} for {{the preparation of}} cells from tissues of salmonid fishes for primary cultivation were the fragment (explant) and enzyme dispersion techniques. Both methods were employed for the cultivation {{of a variety of}} tissues from Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., and the steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri gairdneri. A technique was devised whereby embryonic cells of these fishes were prepared in primary culture and maintained with periodic fluid changes and transfers over long periods of time. These preparations, referred to as stock cultures, were used as a cell source for much of the experimental work reported here. The optimum concentration of cell inoculum for primary culture of embryonic cells was found to be one to one and one-half million per ml of culture medium. The optimum concentration of cell inoculum for subcultures of the primary cultures was found to be 600, 000 per ml of medium. Several enzymes were compared with trypsin for the preparation of primary cell cultures. All were able to cause separation of cells from the tissue mass; however, these test enzymes were found to be more toxic to the cells than trypsin. The {{first of a series of}} experiments to determine factors influencing cell growth involved the comparison of five tissue culture media. Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 20 percent agamma calf serum was found to be more growth stimulatory for embryonic cells than any of the other preparations tested. The addition of 25 percent by volume of Eagle's basal medium with 20 percent agamma calf serum removed from an actively growing culture to 75 percent by volume of this same medium failed to stimulate more cell growth than did Eagle's basal medium prepared with all fresh components. There appeared to be no growth stimulatory factors for these cells present in the fluid of actively growing cultures. Antibiotics have been employed at concentrations as high as 1000 units of penicillin, 1000 micrograms of streptomycin and 100 units of <b>Mycostatin</b> per ml of medium for the control of microorganisms without any indication of toxicity. Cultures were routinely carried for long periods of time at concentrations of 100 units penicillin, 100 micrograms streptomycin and 25 units <b>Mycostatin</b> without obvious harmful effects. Vitamin B₁₂ was found to inhibit growth of steelhead trout embryonic cells at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg per liter in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 20 percent agamma calf serum. Oxaloacetic acid was also incorporated into this same medium at 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 millimolar concentrations. This compound was found to inhibit the growth of coho salmon embryonic cells. The use of blood serum to supplement media was investigated. Homologous fish serum was toxic for the steelhead embryonic cell cultures tested. Horse serum failed to support growth of these same cells. Human and calf serum, with and without gamma globulin, were compared and the agamma calf serum was superior to the other three as a growth stimulant for fish cells. The growth of coho salmon embryonic cells was inhibited when incubated in an atmosphere containing concentrations of one and three percent CO₂. Steelhead trout embryonic cells were found to grow best at 18 ° and 23 ° C. Twenty-eight and 35 ° C. were both lethal for these cells. Cultures incubated at 4 ° and 13 ° C. failed to grow. Twenty-five degrees centigrade was believed to be inhibitory for these cultures but not lethal. Observations indicated that the pH of the medium used to culture chinook salmon embryonic cells increased in alkalinity shortly after planting, followed by a slow decrease requiring approximately 28 days to reach values near neutrality. Cells of hepatoma tissue excised from adult rainbow trout were cultured and studied during the course of this work. A number of cultures have been grown under conditions of continuous cultivation.

Patients received antifungal prophylaxis with oral <b>mycostatin</b> (1, 000, 000 U four times daily) or clotrimazole (1 troche five times daily). Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. There {{was no significant difference}} between groups in race, age, or type and stage of leukemia, but there were more males in the placebo group (P = 0. 073 [Fisher's exact test]). Fewer enoxacin patients had gram-negative bacteremia (1 versus 14 [P < 0. 001]), gram-negative infection at any site (2 versus 19 [P < 0. 001]), or bacterial and/or fungal infection (17 versus 26 [P = 0. 056]). There was no significant difference in the number of patients with gram-positive infection at any site (12 versus 16), gram-positive bacteremia (9 versus 10), deep fungal infection (6 versus 2), death (2 versus 3), other antimicrobial therapy required (48 versus 48), therapy with amphotericin B (15 versus 7 [P = 0. 105]), any adverse event (45 versus 36), or any study drug-associated adverse events (13 versus 6). Logistic regression confirmed (odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals are given in parentheses) that enoxacin reduced the risk of gram-negative infection (0. 07; 0. 01 to 0. 30), especially gram-negative bacillary bacteremia (0. 05; 0. 01 to 0. 37), without altering the risk of gram-positive bacterial (0. 63; 0. 26 to 1. 5), deep fungal (2. 57; 0. 47 to 13. 9), or Clostridium difficile (1. 16; 0. 3 to 4. 56) infection.

At this temperature, lettuce heads were still field fresh and bright green, without apparent sign of quality deterioration. At 70 F, none of the treatments could prolong the shelf-life of the lettuce more than l week. Lettuce heads maintained the best marketing quality when stored in atmospheres of 2. 5 percent O 2 and 2. 5 percent CO 2 at 35 F for 60 days. Microbe- and senescence-inhibiting chemicals (Captan, Phaltan, <b>Mycostatin,</b> and N 6 -benzyladenine) had {{detrimental effects on the}} quality of lettuce stored in controlled atmosphere. The reduction in russet spotting was the major benefit in controlled atmosphere storage at 35 F. In addition, the incidence of pink rib and butt discoloration was less than for those lettuce heads held in the conventional refrigerator. However, the hearts of the lettuce were sensitive to low O 2 injury in controlled atmospheres consisting of 1 percent O 2 and l percent CO 2. Controlled atmosphere (2. 5 percent O 2, 2. 5 percent CO 2) and controlled atmosphere combined with polyethylene packaging reduced the CO 2 production, degradation of chlorophyll, loss of total sugar, and starch. Phaltan (microbe inhibitor, 1, 000 ppm) or Phaltan in combination with polyethylene packaging under controlled atmosphere storage had an adverse effect on the lettuce held in the conventional refrigerator. In every case, the rate of respiration was in direct correlation with the sugar retention data...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of the}} following 22 Minnesotan aquatic plants was investigated: Anacharis Canadensis, Calla Polustris, Carex lacstris, Ceratophyllum demersum, Chara vulgaris, Elecharis smallii, Lemna minor, Myriophyllum exalbescens, Nuphar variegatum, Nymphaea turberosa, Potamogeton amplifolius, P. natans, P. pectinatus, P. richardsonu, P. zosteriformis, Sagittaria cuneata, S. latifolia, Sparganium eurycarpum, S. fluctuans, Typha angustifolia, Vallisneria amiercana, and Zizania aquetica, Furthermore, the chemical constituents responsible for the significant antimicrobial effect were isolated and identified. The skellysolve F. chloroform, 80 % ethanol and fresh water extracts of plant species were treated for antimicrobial activity employing the qualitative filter paper disc diffusion method and reference antibiotic discs. Ethanol (80 %) extracts of Myriophyllum exalbescens (activity ratio of. 34 {{as compared to the}} 30 mcg chloramphenicol discs) Nymphaea tuberose (leaf:. 40, stem:. 45) were moderately active against S. aureus. Ethanol (80 %) extracts of Carex lacustris (activity ratio of. 34 as compared to the 10 mcg streptomycin discs), Nymphaea tuberose (leaf: 1. 01, stem: 1. 10) and Nuphar variegatum collected in Lake Minnetonka (leaf:. 73, stem:. 58) were active against M. smegmatis. All extracts were relatively inactive against E. coli except the water extract of Potamogeton natans where a low activity ration of. 10 as compare to the 30 mcg chloramphenicol discs was indicated. Skellysolve F stem extracts of Nuphar variegatum collected in the Pine Lake and Sparganium fluctuans showed a rather distinct action against C. albicans, the activity ratio as compared to the 100 units <b>mycostatin</b> discs were 2. 06 and 1. 08, respectively. Regarding antifungal activity, ethanol (80 %) extracts of Carex lacustris (activity ratio of 1. 08 as compared to 5 % aq. Phenol standard), Nymphaea tuberosa (stem:. 72) and skellysolve F extract of Potamogeton zosteriformis (. 60) were active against Alternaria sp., 80 % ethanol stem extracts of Nymphaea tuberosa and Nuphar variegatum were active against F. roseum with the activity ratios of. 41 and. 48 respectively, as compared to the 5 % aqueous phenol standard. In general, the plant pathogenic fungi are more resistant than animal pathogenic organisms toward the actions of aquatic plant extract. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E
40|$|Pasteurella multocida {{is a small}} Gram {{negative}} bacillus {{which causes}} disease in many animal species. Its pathogenicity is attributed to two mechanisms: invasiveness and toxin production. The proportion of strains which produce toxin is low but such strains cause severe atrophic rhinitis in swine. Invasiveness is the predominant mechanism of pathogenicity and is largely dependant on the possession of a capsule. P. multocida is divided into five serotypes (A, B, D, E and F) based on the antigenic structure of the capsule and a correlation exists between serotype, disease and the animal species affected. However, many isolates are non-typable due to the possession of a non-antigenic (hyaluronic acid) capsule. The presence of an antigenic capsule and a hyaluronic acid capsule are independant. ie one, both or neither may be present. To facilitate the isolation of P. multocida we assessed the selective medium of Smith and Baskerville (1983) and found that many New Zealand isolates of P. multocida grew poorly {{in the absence of}} blood (not present in Smith and Baskerville's medium). Furthermore, many isolates were inhibited by Polymixin and the high alkalinity (pH 8. 6) of the medium. On the basis of these observations we formulated a modified selective medium which omitted Polymixin and was composed of a blood agar base at neutral pH. However, it contained three antibiotics (Gentamycin, Bacitracin and <b>Mycostatin)</b> present in the original medium of Smith and Baskerville. This modified medium propagated all our test isolates of P. multocida which were derived from seven animal species (fowl, sheep, goat, cattle, rabbit, dog, cat). It also suppressed the background flora present in swabs taken from the nasal cavity of rabbits. Both the traditional isolation technique of plating specimens on blood agar and the modified selective medium were used to obtain isolates of P. multocida from several species of domestic animal. These were: pigs (15 isolates), rabbits (25), cats (10), dogs (21) and deer (1). Isolates were examined in some detail. Isolates were serotyped using the indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA). They were found to be Type A (7 %), B (1 %), D (9 %) or untypable (83 %). This is similar to overseas findings. The IHA assay is a laborious technique so two possible alternatives were examined. viz sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide-gel analysis (SDS-PAGE) of proteins and restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of DNA. Both techniques failed to distinguish between P. multocida serotypes in the sense that isolates were extremely heterogeneous and most gave a unique pattern both with SDS-PAGE and REA. This heterogeneity allowed the identification of individual strains of P. multocida and consequently SDS-PAGE was used in an epidemiological investigation which traced the origin of an outbreak of respiratory disease in rabbits and provided evidence that the outbreak was not (as was earlier believed) due to the introduction of rabbits from overseas into a New Zealand colony. Furthermore, using this approach we were able to show that strains which cause severe pneumonia were not confined to the lower respiratory tract but could also be carried in the nasal cavity. This is consistent with the accepted hypothesis that P. multocida is an opportunistic pathogen. Severe atrophic rhinitis is a disease of pigs which is caused by toxin-producing strains of P. multocida. The disease is responsible for much economic loss overseas but has not been reported in New Zealand. We obtained a toxigenic strain of P. multocida and used it to validate an in vitro (mammalian cell culture) method for detecting toxin-producing strains. This method was then used to examine New Zealand isolates of P. multocida. None of these were shown to be toxigenic. This suggests that toxigenic strains, if present in New Zealand, are not common. Diseases due to P. multocida are commonly treated with antimicrobial agents such as the Penicillins, Aminoglycosides and Sulphonamides. Strains which are resistant to these agents are present in overseas countries and resistance is associated with the presence of plasmids. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), of four antimicrobials (Penicillin G, Streptomycin, Tetracycline and Sulphadiazine) for New Zealand isolates. Considerable variation was found between isolates but no isolate was of sufficiently high resistance to be considered "resistant". This was despite the fact that 12 of 73 (16 %) of the field isolates possessed plasmids of a similar size (1 Mdal to 5 Mdal) to plasmids known to carry antibiotic resistance markers. Despite its importance as a pathogen of swine, cattle, sheep, fowl and rabbits, P. multocida has been little studied in New Zealand. This thesis represents a preliminary stage to a fuller understanding of the importance of P. multocida in this country and the best means of control. The possibility of outbreaks of disease due to P. multocida, eg atrophic rhinitis, may well stimutate further work on this organism...|$|E
