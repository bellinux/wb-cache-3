5000|$|The <b>meter</b> <b>dial</b> can be {{set from}} 6 to 3200 ASA and the dial also doubles as the {{exposure}} compensation dial. When in compensation mode is active, a small flag appears in the viewfinder to reminding of the change from normal. Exposure control is manual or aperture priority automaticThe LX has excellent low-light performance using dynamic, off-the-film-plane TTL metering called Integrated Direct Metering (IDM).Pre-release exposure information is obtained from light reflected from a patterned shutter curtain back to the metering cell. This gives the values displayed in the viewfinder. Once the shutter is released, the light reflected from the film and/or the shutter curtains continues to be measured as the exposure takes place and is used to adjust the exposure time. Automatic exposure time is up to 125 seconds.This exposure metering has a range from EV1 to EV19 for manual exposure and a EV-5.5 to EV20 that is stepless in automatic making the camera excellent for available light photography.TTL flash control is also available using Pentax dedicated units (AF400T & AF280T), also taking measurements from the IDM during the exposure. The TTL capabilities are extended to the pc-sockets with the addition of two smaller gold plated contacts just under the [...] "X-Sync" [...] plug for previously mentioned as well as compatible flash.|$|E
40|$|Subjects {{pressed a}} {{telegraph}} key to illuminate a <b>meter</b> <b>dial</b> on which pointer deflections appeared at fixed intervals. Upon detecting a deflection {{they were required}} to press another key to reset the pointer to zero. This detecting and resetting operation reinforced the behavior of pressing the light-flashing key (i. e., the observing responses). The usual pattern of responding on the light-flashing key was a long pause following the reinforcement and an abrupt transition to a steady response rate {{toward the end of the}} interval. When the subjects were required to perform a concurrent subtraction task, the pattern of responding changed in varying degrees, ranging from complete loss of typical fixed-interval behavior to a slight shortening of the post-reinforcement pause. These effects were attributed to the disruption of the self-produced verbal chains (counting or reciting) that ordinarily govern human behavior on this schedule...|$|E

Such {{misalignment}} would be intolerable in a calculator's dials, so each of the Marchant's dials had a constant-lead ("snail") cam attached. Omitting important details, this cam determined the amount of movement needed to realign the result dials. That correction was applied by a second spur-gear differential, again, one per dial.|$|R

We believe students will benefit from a consistency of approach and the links made across the curriculum. We recognise a need to ensure practice is embedded within all departments enabling improvement in these skills. We believe that all teachers share responsibility for the teaching of numeracy and literacy across the curriculum, in partnership with parents. Numeracy Students will emerge with a better ability to describe, explain and justify their thinking, become more confident in using numbers in context and handling data, be more accurate in their graphical skills and in the use of measurements, and develop the ability to apply numerical understanding and skills confidently thus enabling them to solve problems in a variety of curriculum contexts and enter the numerical demands of adulthood with confidence.

40|$|A {{software}} {{system has been}} developed that gives engineers and operations personnel with no "formal" programming expertise, but {{who are familiar with}} the Microsoft Windows operating system, the ability to create visualization displays to monitor the health and performance of aircraft/spacecraft. This {{software system}} is currently supporting the X 38 V 201 spacecraft component/system testing and is intended to give users the ability to create, test, deploy, and certify their subsystem displays in a fraction of the time that it would take to do so using previous software and programming methods. Within the visualization system there are three major components: the developer, the deployer, and the widget set. The developer is a blank canvas with widget menu items that give users the ability to easily create displays. The deployer is an application that allows for the deployment of the displays created using the developer application. The deployer has additional functionality that the developer does not have, such as printing of displays, screen captures to files, windowing of displays, and also serves as the interface into the documentation archive and help system. The third major component is the widget set. The widgets are the visual representation of the items that will make up the display (i. e., <b>meters,</b> <b>dials,</b> buttons, numerical indicators, string indicators, and the like). This software was developed using Visual C++ and uses COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software where possible...|$|R

50|$|Metered bezels: Many chronographs have a bezel, that {{is either}} fixed or can rotate, {{around the outside}} of the dial that is marked to {{specific}} scales to allow rapid calculations. While any wristwatch can have a bezel, the chronograph stop start feature, as well as the rotation of the bezel, allows more complex calculations or repeated measurements for a series of calculations. The most popular meter is for Tachymeter readings: a simple scale that allows rapid calculations of speed. Other bezels feature Telemeter scale, for distance. The watchmaking company Breitling offers a model with a rotating bezel, in conjunction with another, fixed, <b>meter</b> on the <b>dial,</b> scaled for use as a slide rule for more complex calculations.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{exploratory}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the effects of advanced display formats and display media on pilot scanning behavior using Langley's oculometer, a desktop flight simulator, a conventional electro-mechanical meter, and various digital displays. The primary task was for the test subject to maintain level flight, on a specific course heading, during moderate turbulence. A secondary task of manually controlling the readout of a display {{was used to examine}} the effects of the display format on a subject's scan behavior. Secondary task scan parameters that were evaluated were average dwell time, dwell time histograms, and number of dwells per meter change. The round <b>dial</b> <b>meter</b> demonstrated shorter dwell times and fewer dwells per meter change than the digital displays. The following factors affected digital display scanning behavior: (1) the number of digits; (2) the update rate of the digits; (3) the display media; and (4) the character font. The size of the digits used in these tests (0. 28 to 0. 50 inches) did not affect scan behavior measures...|$|R

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} marvel {{was reviewed}} in several publications, next are included three of them: [...] Review 1: The largest pendulum in the Exhibition is the revolving one above the large clock made by Farcot. The pendulum m long is {{suspended from the}} roof m high of the building, performs six revolutions in a minute, and is made in conformity with Foucault’s method. The large gilt ball which serves for the bob, about 2 feet in diameter, must be subject to considerable disturbance from the wind, for being just opposite the main entrance {{it is in a}} very draughty position.Review 2: In the middle of the noble space under the entrance tower, stood the Monumental Clock, constructed by M. Eugène Farcot, inmense in size, elaborate in design, and almost equalling as a wonder, though falling very far short in elaboration, the celebrated Clock of Strasbourg. It was of about twenty-two and a half feet in height, with four faces, rich though chaste in ornamentation; and the motion was communicated by a pendulum more than one hundred feet in length, suspended from the centre of the dome above, with a terrestrial globe of some four feet in diameter at the end, oscillating in about ten seconds, and acting upon a needle, invisible, like all the other mechanism. The lower portion had elaborate bas-reliefs in bronze with caryatides of the seasons at the corners; and it was surrounded, at a distance marking the limits of the central pavilion, by a circle of statues virtually forming a guard of honor for the central mechanical curiosity of the exhibition.Review 3 (translated from French): In the middle of the Palais du Champ-de-Mars vestibule of honor, beneath the grand central dome, a monumental clock, work of the skilled mechanical-horologist Mr. Eugène Farcot, attracts keen admiration.This is a real monument, over 7 meters high, composed of a plinth ornamented with bas-reliefs representing the attributes of arts and industry, at each of whose four corners stand two-meter-high bronze caryatids supporting a pedimented turret. The clock sits in the center, with its four 1 <b>meter</b> 25 diameter <b>dial</b> faces.As a pendulum, a 1 m. 25 diameter metallic ball, weighing around 100 kilograms, representing the earth, with its continents and islands emerging in gilt relief against a blue sea background. This globe, encircled by a gilt ring bearing, also in relief, the signs of the zodiac, is suspended {{from the center of the}} dome, 2 meters above the clock, connected to its invisible movement by a needle. This pendulum rotates, under its own weight, around a simulated sun at the centre of the circle it describes, which extends approximately 15 meters. It accomplishes this progression in 10 seconds.The clock [...] "runs by itself"; the spontaneous undulations of this enormous pendulum obey natural laws too well known to require explanation; however some visitors seemed very intrigued and very curious to know where was the [...] "little beast" [...] that moves the entire device. — They were, of course, a tiny minority.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 In 1957 three Douglas-fir stands (15 -, 25 -, and 40 -year-old age classes) were {{selected}} {{on a tree}} farm in the Cascade foothills of northwestern Oregon to study factors affecting site productivity. Soil-moisture, soil-temperature and seasonal radial- growth pattern measurements were made with a Colman moisture <b>meter</b> and a <b>dial</b> gauge dendrometer on thinned and unthinned subareas. Soil temperatures were significantly increased by thinning in each stand. This effect decreased with soil depth and increased with increasing intensity of thinning. Root distribution studies eight years after thinning showed that a heavily thinned stand had relatively few roots in the lower profile between the remaining trees, {{in contrast to the}} complete distribution throughout the profile in the unthinned subareas. This would indicate less overall soil-moisture depletion with thinning since the available soil-moisture levels measured within the fully rooted zone were not significantly different for the various thinning treatments. As expected radial growth increased significantly with increasing intensity of thinning. The amount and proportion of late season growth tended to increase with increasing thinning intensity although the observed differences were not statistically significant. Late season growth, however, was significantly increased by increasing crown position (intermediate to dominant) regardless of thinning treatment. Irrigation of selected trees at a ridgetop area extended the spring maximum radial growth rate throughout most of the summer. On comparable non-irrigated trees growth retardation was detectable in the range of one-half to one atmospheres of soil-moisture tension. Growth cessation occurred when soil-moisture-tension values reached the two to five atmosphere range. Irrigation of trees in a young hillside bench stand slightly increased radial growth rate during the first two years, but decreased growth in relation to non-irrigated trees during the next two years apparently as a result of excess irrigation. Fertilization with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers increased the late season radial growth of irrigated and non-irrigated trees in both stands. The late season response is attributed to a dwindling supply of mineralized soil nitrogen in the late summer and early fall. Irrigation and fertilization combined gave approximately additive increases in radial growth which ranged from 35 to 60 percent. It is hypothesized that potential radial growth (except for short periods at the start and end of the growing season) is equivalent to the maximum spring rate. Departures from this maximum result from deficiencies in moisture, mineral nutrient elements, or heat. Thus the maximum growth rate is proposed as an important characteristic, reflecting the potential carbohydrate productive capacity of the crown when raw material levels exceed rate limiting supplies. The fertility status of each research area was assessed by various means including soil chemical and physical analyses, sampling and chemical analyses of forest floor and litter fall material and pot fertility tests. The relative ranking of these areas in terms of fertility was consistent with their site index or productivity rating. Monterey pine and Douglas-fir seedling test plants grown on the potted soils from the different horizons in each profile responded to nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur additions. In field tests nitrogen fertilization stimulated radial growth of Douglas-fir whereas phosphorus fertilizer at high application rates resulted in a growth depression...|$|R
