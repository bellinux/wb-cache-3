40|$|The {{possible}} {{application of}} imidazolium ionic liquids as energy-efficient green material for extractive deep desulfurization of liquid fuel has been investigated. 1 -Butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride [BMIM]Cl was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction of n-methylimidazolium and 1 -chlorobutane. Molecular {{structures of the}} ILs were confirmed by FTIR, 1 H-NMR, and 13 C-NMR. The thermal properties, conductivity, solubility, water content and viscosity analysis of [BMIM]Cl were carried out. The effects of reaction time, reaction temperature, sulfur compounds, and recycling of IL <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> on dibenzothiophene removal of liquid fuel were presented. In the extractive desulfurization process, the removal of dibenzothiophene in n-dodecane using [BMIM]Cl was 81 % with mass ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1, in 30 [*]min at 30 °C under the mild reaction conditions. Also, desulfurization of real fuels with IL and multistage extraction were studied. The results of this work might offer significant insights in the perceptive use of imidazoled ILs as energy-efficient green material for extractive deep desulfurization of liquid fuels {{as it can be}} reused <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> with considerable extraction efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A regenerable {{polyvinyl}} alcohol/organic boron {{fracturing fluid}} system with 1. 6 wt % polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and 1. 2 wt % organic boron (OBT) was studied, {{and its main}} regeneration mechanism is the reversible cross-linking reaction between B(OH) 4 - and hydroxyl groups of PVOH as the change of pH. Results of rheology evaluations show that both the apparent viscosity and the thermal stability of the fracturing fluid decreased with the regeneration number of times increasing. In addition, the apparent viscosity of the fluid which was <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> was {{more sensitive to the}} shear action compared with that of the fluid with regeneration once or twice. When the fracturing fluid was <b>without</b> <b>regeneration,</b> the elasticity was dominating due to the three-dimensional network structure of the formed gel; the vis-cosity gradually occupied the advantage when the fracturing fluid was regenerated once or twice. The settling velocity of proppant was accelerated by both the regeneration process and the increasing temperature, but it was decelerated when the proppant ratio increased. Results of core damage tests indicate that less permeability damage was caused by the PVOH/OBT fracturing fluid compared with that caused by the guar gum fracturing fluid after gel breaking...|$|R

Even after the significant progress in the technology for antibody screening from huge libraries, {{it takes a long time}} to isolate an antibody, which prevents a prompt action against the spread of a disease. Here, we report a new strategy for isolating desired antibodies from a combinatorial library in one day by repeated fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). First, we constructed a library of synthetic human antibody in which single-chain variable fragment (scFv) was expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. After labeling the cells with fluorescent antigen probes, the highly fluorescent cells were sorted by using a high-speed cell sorter, and these cells were reused <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> in the next round of sorting. After repeating this sorting, the positive clones were completely enriched in several hours. Thus, we screened the library against three viral antigens, including the H 1 N 1 influenza virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Foot-and-mouth disease virus. Finally, the potential antibody candidates, which show K(D) values between 10 and 100 nM against the target antigens, could be successfully isolated even though the library was relatively small (∼ 10 (6)). These results show that repeated FACS screening <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the sorted cells can be a powerful method when a rapid response to a spreading disease is required...|$|R

The adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models. The maximum adsorption capacities were 0. 297 and 0. 235 mg/g for Cu and Ni respectively. The adsorption of Cu and Ni was thermodynamically spontaneous. Cu adsorption was endothermic whilst Ni adsorption was exothermic.

40|$|To {{maintain}} the biological stability {{of drinking water}} during distribution in large, complex networks, high standards have to be met [...] namely, low bacterial densities {{and low levels of}} biodegradable organic carbon. Second-stage granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration (<b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> of carbon) is used for this purpose at the Choisy-le-Roi, Paris, France, treatment plant. Effective removal of dissolved organic carbon has been observed with such filtration mainly because of a reduction in the biodegradable organic carbon. To study the microbial processes involved in this removal, new methods based on the use of radio-labeled tracers have been developed in order to measure the bacterial biomass and activity associated with GAC. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|An {{irreversible}} cycle {{model of}} the Brayton heat engine is established, in which the irreversibilities resulting from the internal dissipation of the working substance in the adiabatic compression and expansion processes and the finite-rate heat transfer in the regenerative and constant-pressure processes are taken into account. The power output, and efficiency of the cycle are expressed as functions of temperatures of the working, substance and the heat sources, heat transfer coefficients, pressure ratio, regenerator effectiveness, and total heat transfer area including the heat transfer areas of the regenerator and other heat exchangers. The regenerative criteria are given. The power output, is optimized for a given efficiency. The general optimal performance characteristics of, the cycle are revealed. The optimal performance of the Brayton heat engines with and <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> is compared quantitatively. The advantages of using the regenerator are expounded. Some important parameters of an irreversible regenerative Brayton heat engine, such as the temperatures of the working substance at different states, pressure ratio, maximum value of the pressure ratio, regenerator effectiveness and ratios of the various heat transfer areas to the total heat transfer area of the cycle, are further optimized. The optimal relations between these parameters and {{the efficiency of the}} cycle are presented by a set of characteristic curves for some assumed compression and expansion, efficiencies. The results obtained may be helpful to the comprehensive understanding of the optimal performance of the Brayton heat engines with and <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> and play a theoretical instructive role for the optimal design of a regenerative Brayton heat engine...|$|R

The effects of ionic liquid loading, extraction temperature and extraction time on the removal of dibenzothiophene from different model liquid fuels n-dodecane, n-octane, n- hexane, and n-heptane were investigated.

After optimization of the chromatographic determination of FB 1 and FB 2 derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde- 2 -mercaptoethanol, {{the efficiency of the}} clean-up of spiked corn extracts with reuse of the IMA columns was studied, both with and <b>without</b> column <b>regeneration.</b> It was found that the IMAcolumn, designated for single-use only, can be used at least five times <b>without</b> <b>regeneration</b> and additional five times after regeneration. Regeneration consists of leaving the phosphate buffer saline solution on the column for one day at 4 ºC. The efficiency of the columns was tested by determining the recovery of FB 1 and FB 2, as well as the reproducibility of the determinations. The mean recoveries of FB 1 and FB 2 from corn spiked with FB 1 at 1. 0 mg/g and with FB 2 at 0. 5 mg/g (on the basis of 10 measurements) were 88. 7 %(RSD 10. 2 %) and 90. 5 %(RSD 6. 1 %), respectively...|$|R
