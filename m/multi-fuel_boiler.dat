40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the life cycle}} environmental impacts of different wood waste processing methods in three impact categories: climate impact, acidification impacts and eutrophication impacts. The wood waste recovery methods examined were the use of wood waste in terrace boards made out of wood composite which replace impregnated terrace boards, incineration of wood waste in a <b>multi-fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> instead of peat {{and the use of}} wood waste in the production of particleboard in either Finland or Central Europe. The results of the life cycle analysis are based on source materials derived from literature, previous Finnish life cycle assessments and database inventory materials. As such, the results do not directly illustrate the impacts of any individual processing facility. The net life cycle emissions of wood composite were positive in all impact categories, meaning that the emissions were higher than the emissions avoided in the production of the replaced impregnated wood. The uncertainty assessments of the environmental impacts show that results are strongly dependent on whether the plastic used in production is virgin or recycled plastic. In other words, the environmental load of wood composite production is inversely proportional to the share of recycled plastic used to produce the composite. No inventory data was available on the acidification impacts and eutrophication impacts of the production of impregnated wood. The climate impact of wood composite production is lower than that of particleboard production but higher than that of energy recovery, as long as the plastic used in production consists primarily of recycled plastic. High-quality wood waste is suitable for the production of particleboard. In fact, in the current market situation all particleboards are produced from industrial wood side streams and waste. Since using wood waste in the production of particleboard does not therefore replace virgin raw materials, no processes are avoided and the results consist only of direct emissions. The energy recovery of wood waste was found to be the best option in Finland in regard to net environmental impacts in all environmental impact categories. Using wood waste to replace fossil fuels in energy production can also reduce the carbon-dioxide emissions resulting from energy production and facilitate the realisation of set climate objectives. According to the EU’s Waste Framework Directive, re-use and material recycling should be preferred to energy recovery from waste. However, according to the Directive reaching the best overall environmental outcome may require specific waste streams departing from the hierarchy where this is justified by life cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste. Based on this study, the energy recovery of wood waste is a justified option in Finland and results in an overall better environmental outcome in regard to life cycle impacts compared to the other recycling methods examined. This should be taken into consideration in the setting of recycling targets based on the EU’s waste directives and in the definition of calculation methods for the recycling rate of wood...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boilers {{are widely}} used for multi-fuel {{combustion}} of waste and bio-fuels. When several non-homogeneous fuels, having varying heat values, are burned simultaneously, the boiler control system can be affected by various control challenges, especially since it is not feasible to reliably measure the energy content of the multi-fuel flow. In order to fulfill energy production needs and maintain the ability to burn low grade fuels, co-firing with high heat value fuels such as gas, oil or coal is needed. Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) has been successfully used for solving control challenges, where operators' process expertise can be transformed into automation. Real life control objects are often non-linear because the dynamics change with the operating point, or there might be other essential non-linearities in the combustion process. The proposed fuzzy control applications were developed to solve control challenges the operators meet in daily operation of a 150 MW(th) CFB at Varenso Oy's (Stora Enso Oyj) K 6 boiler in Varkaus Finland. Before implementing the applications in the fullscale boiler, they were tested at a 2 MW(e) pilot plant boiler at Foster Wheeler Energia Oy's Research Center in Karhula, Finland. According to the industrial experiments, the four applications (steam pressure control, compensation of fuel quality fluctuation, fuel-feed optimization and increased bed inventory monitoring) discussed in this thesis, showed satisfactory performance and various improvements to the boiler control were achieved. Fuzzy logic control was {{shown to be a}} notable tool to improve the <b>multi-fuel</b> CFB <b>boiler</b> control...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from a <b>multi-fuel</b> {{domestic}} <b>boiler</b> (40 kW), fired {{with nine}} different agro-biomass pellets have been compared. The pellets include apple pomace (Malus domestica), {{reed canary grass}} (Phalaris arundinacea), pectin waste from citrus shells (Citrus reticulata), sunflower husk (Helianthus annuus), peat, two types of straw pellets and two types of wood pellets. The measurements of emissions comprised carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x), unburned hydrocarbons (C x H y), sulphur oxides (SO x) and flue dust mass concentration (by DINplus and isokinetic sampling methods). Comparison of experimental emission values with relevant quality labels (Blue Angel and Swan Mark) and standard (EN- 303 - 5) showed that the boiler satisfied the emissions requirements of Blue Angel, Swan Mark and EN- 303 - 5 when using wood pellets- 1 (except CO emission), reed canary grass and citrus pectin waste pellets as fuel at nominal load. The wood pellets- 1 yielded the highest boiler efficiency of 92. 4 %. Dusts emission varied {{as a function of}} fine content and elemental constituent of the pellets and was the highest with sunflower husk. CO and C x H y emissions were maximum with peat pellets. NO x emissions were below the concerned permissible values with all experimental pellets. Emissions of NO x and SO x were found maximum with straw pellets. For agro-pellets, statistical differences in ash contents were significant. High ash contents and low ash melting temperature made straw pellets less suitable for domestic applications. Reed canary grass, citrus pectin and apple pellets were the most suitable agro-pellets for small scale boilers with reasonable less ash contents and less emissions as compared to others. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
