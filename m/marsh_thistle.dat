25|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of the Faroe Islands {{is dominated by}} arctic-alpine plants, wildflowers, grasses, moss and lichen.

25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), <b>marsh</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{tracks and}} clearings in forest {{and at the}} edge of {{woodland}} and tracks through carr.The larvae of C. albipila feed inside the base of the stems of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Thistles</b> (Cirsium palustre) Adult Females lay eggs in the rosettes of mature plants in early spring when adults are most active. Usually there is only one larvae per plant and they feed by tunnelling up the pithy centre of the main thistles stem. The larvae mature about mid to late June in southern UK and then leave the plant to pupate in the soil around the thistle. Flight times of adults are Late February to May, peeking around mid April. Adults feed on Bellis, Betula, Caltha, Cardamine, Corylus, Prunus spinosa, Ribes uvacrispa, Salix, Taraxacum, Tussilago and Vaccinium.|$|R
50|$|B. bohemicus is an obligate parasite, {{and so it}} {{is almost}} always found in {{association}} with a host nest. It parasitizes Bombus locurum, Bombus cryptarum, and Bombus terrestris. In the short time that B. bohemicus is independently foraging, it feeds on the nectar of flowering plants. It shows preference to a diverse selection of scrub-type food plants across its large geographical range, such as: thyme, scabious, knapweed, ling, lavender, masterwort, <b>marsh,</b> and <b>thistles</b> for the male, and sallow, dandelion, clover, bilberry, sycamore, cornflowers, bistort, bugle, thyme, cotoneaster, heath, and raspberry for the female. After invading the host nest, it will be fed by the foraging host workers according to their particular foraging habits.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{protected}} in Southern glades include wildflowers like Samolus parviflorus (water pimpernel), yellowtop, lavender <b>thistle,</b> <b>marsh</b> pinks, and grass pink orchids (Calapogon tuberosus). Bird inhabitants include double-crested cormorants, great blue heron, little blue heron, tricolored heron, snowy egret, osprey, kingfisher and grebe. Native poisonwood grows in these areas. Other species include white-crowned pigeon, Spike rush, sawgrass, crayfish, marsh rabbit, deer and Florida panther; {{as well as}} colicroot (Aletris bracteata), the lavender ground orchid Bletia purpurea and Pinguicula pumila, a dwarf butterwort.|$|R

6000|$|... 14. Here is {{a sketch}} of a crested leaf of less adverse temper, which {{may as well be}} given, {{together}} with Plate III., in this number, these two engravings being meant for examples of two different methods of drawing, both useful according to character of subject. Plate III. is sketched first with a finely-pointed pen, and common ink, on white paper; then washed rapidly with colour, and retouched with the pen to give sharpness and completion. {115} This method is used because the thistle leaves are full of complex and sharp sinuosities, and set with intensely sharp spines passing into hairs, which require many kinds of execution with the fine point to imitate at all. In the drawing there was more look of the bloom or woolliness on the stems, but it was useless to try for this in the mezzotint, and I desired Mr. Allen to leave his work at the stage where it expressed as much form as I wanted. The leaves are of the common <b>marsh</b> <b>thistle,</b> of which more anon; and the two long lateral ones are only two different views of the same leaf, while the central figure is a young leaf just opening. It beat me, in its delicate bossing, and I had to leave it, discontentedly enough.|$|E

50|$|Cirsium brevistylum {{grows in}} moist areas in {{many types of}} habitat, from {{mountain}} forests to chaparral and coastal <b>marshes.</b> This native <b>thistle</b> is annual or biennial, reaching 200 cm in height and known to exceed 300 cm at times. There is usually a single stem which may branch toward the top and is coated in hairs and webby fibers. The leaves are deeply cut into many lobes lined with twisted teeth, the longest leaves near {{the base of the}} plant reaching about 25 centimeters long. The leaves are borne on winged petioles with many spines. The inflorescence bears one to many flower heads, both at the ends of the stem branches and in the leaf axils. The flower head reaches about 3 centimeters long by 4 wide and is lined with cobwebby, bristly, spine-tipped phyllaries. The flower head is packed with white or pink flowers about 2 centimeters long. The fruit is a brown achene a few millimeters long topped with a pappus one to two centimeters in length.|$|R

50|$|Wrightâ€™s <b>marsh</b> <b>thistle</b> is most {{known for}} its {{extraordinary}} height of up to 300 cm (10 feet).

50|$|Wright's <b>marsh</b> <b>thistle</b> {{is known}} to be found at the present time in only 7 {{counties}} in South-Central New Mexico.

Since these are wetland plants, a decrease in water has detrimental effects on their survival.|$|E

30|$|Where observation-based {{information}} on fire was absent, review authors often inferred potential fire relationships from botanical and ecological data, which {{was available for}} most species reviews. When authors based an assertion on inference, they described {{the basis for the}} inference rather than presenting it as though based on observation. For example, although immediate fire effects on common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) were not reported in the literature, the species review (Gucker 2009 e) reports that its rhizomes are generally robust, sturdy, and stout, suggesting that they would likely survive fire. Several species reviews had no {{information on}} postfire seedling establishment but noted the speciesâ€™ wind-dispersed seed or successful seedling establishment in high-light environments (e.g., <b>marsh</b> <b>thistle</b> [Cirsium palustre] [Gucker 2009 a], swallow-worts [Cynanchum louiseae and C. rossicum] [Stone 2009 a], giant hogweed [Heracleum mantegazzianum] [Gucker 2009 c], silkreed [Stone 2010], and white poplar [Populus alba] [Gucker 2010 b]). These reviews described the species as having high potential for establishment in the postfire environment if a seed source is nearby. Guckerâ€™s (2010 a) review describes cypress spurge (Euphorbia cyparissias), with its typically hard seed coat and persistent seed bank, as potentially regenerating from seed after fire. Inferences such as these should be applied to management issues with caution until observations from test plots or monitoring indicate whether the species responds as expected.|$|E
