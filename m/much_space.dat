5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent <b>much</b> <b>space</b> to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too <b>much</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since the twin-turbo V6 engine {{occupies}} {{almost as}} <b>much</b> <b>space</b> as their 3-cylinder engines, {{the fuel tank}} had to be relocated to {{the nose of the}} car, where a luggage compartment used to be.

25|$|Architect Arthur Cotton Moore {{said that}} massed, block-long {{building}} lines were necessary {{due to the}} need to use as <b>much</b> <b>space</b> as possible. To break up the monolithic, wall-like effect of this massing, each long facade was broken in multiple smaller facades and different architectural styles used to make the buildings visually interesting. Moore said he designed the walkways so that pedestrians see only one facade at a time, so consistency in architectural vision is maintained.|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman, who {{believes}} the Josephus passage on John is authentic, states that Christian interpolators {{would have been}} very unlikely to have devoted almost twice as <b>much</b> <b>space</b> to John (163 words) as to Jesus (89 words). Feldman also states that a Christian interpolator would have likely altered Josephus' passage about John the Baptist to make the circumstances of the death of John become similar to the New Testament, and to indicate that John was a forerunner of Jesus.|$|E
5000|$|Word spacing {{is crucial}} for the written form because it {{illustrates}} the sound of speech where audible gaps or pauses take place [...] With typography, word spacing shows this unspoken aspect of speech. Otherwise, {{it would be difficult}} for people to read one long continuous line of letters. It is hard to determine how <b>much</b> <b>spacing</b> should be put in between words, but a good typographer is able to determine proper spacing. When text and spacing are consistent, this makes it easier to read.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{invention}} of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed <b>much</b> <b>space</b> and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.|$|E
25|$|By June 1853, both {{participating}} {{members and}} brokers were taking up so <b>much</b> <b>space</b> that the Exchange was now uncomfortably crowded and continual expansion plans were taking place. Having already been extended west, east and northwards, {{it was then}} decided the Exchange needed an entire new establishment. Thomas Allason was appointed as the main architect, and in March 1854 the new brick building inspired from the Great Exhibition stood ready. This was a huge improvement of both surroundings and space, with twice the floor space available.|$|E
25|$|If a Turing {{reduction}} of A to B exists then every algorithm for B {{can be used}} to produce an algorithm for A, by inserting the algorithm for B at each place where the oracle machine computing A queries the oracle for B. However, because the oracle machine may query the oracle a large number of times, the resulting algorithm may require more time asymptotically than either the algorithm for B or the oracle machine computing A, and may require as <b>much</b> <b>space</b> as both together.|$|E

25|$|All {{traffic from}} Gran Canaria, {{including}} five large airliners, had been diverted to Los Rodeos, a regional airport {{that could not}} easily accommodate them. The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway parallel to it, with four short taxiways connecting the two. While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen, the diverted aircraft took up so <b>much</b> <b>space</b> that they were parked on the long taxiway, meaning {{that it could not}} be used for taxiing. Instead, departing aircraft had to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack.|$|E
