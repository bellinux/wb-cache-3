5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E

On November 25, 2002, the City of Bellevue agreed to purchase the Qwest building for $29 million, primarily to house the police and fire departments after $33 million in renovations. The city council approved a preliminary plan to move other city offices into the Qwest building in March 2003, citing lower maintenance costs and plentiful capacity in the new building. The plan was finalized in July, estimating the total cost of renovation at $102.4 million (including $29 million used to purchase the building in 2002), and returning the city hall to downtown {{for the first time in}} 25 years. To finance the project, the city issued $103 million in 40-year <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds,</b> which were partially refunded in 2012.|$|E

The change in regulations governing Romanian municipalities source of financing in 1998, allowed local governments to access alternative financing sources, mainly for medium and long term investment projects, through bond issuance. A secondary market for <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> trading was launched at Bucharest Stock Exchange at the end of November 2001 and the exchange also offers a platform for announcement and subscriptions of <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> public offerings. Thus, more than a decade later, the Romanian <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> market segment remains in a premature stage of development. The paper presents a comprehensive data set of Romanian <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> sector since it was launched in November 2001 until December 2013.

The findings highlight the factors influencing the trading decisions and might represent some suggested ides to be considered by their <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> issuers and the financial intermediaries assisting them. The investigations show that coupon and risk premium play only marginal roles in trading decisions hinting toward an unsophisticated market, dominated by a small number of institutional investors which rather treasure the scarce <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> offer. The absence of rating and the inappropriate correlation mainly between the risk premium and the economic potential of the issuer impair on further developments. The lack of sophistication displayed by the Romanian financial system, which also does not provide credit enhancements dedicated to local government, along with a thin domestic investor base are factors fencing, at least for the moment, the possibilities to overcome the rating problem and the offer diversity problem...|$|R
40|$|Using new econometric methods, we {{separately}} estimate average {{transaction costs}} for over 167, 000 bonds from a 1 -year sample of all U.

Also, <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> trades are substantially more expensive than similar-sized equity trades. We attribute these results {{to the lack of}} bond market price transparency.
