2500|$|Fulci's {{version is}} as follows: [...] "One day I told Dardano {{the plot of}} my Evil Comes Back (later retitled Per Sempre/Until Death), a sequel on a fantastic note to The Postman Always Rings Twice, and he {{proposed}} it to several producers with <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with his name on it! (laughs) I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer (Sergio Martino), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Village in 2004, Shyamalan had been {{planning}} a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out {{so that he could}} make Lady in the Water. [...] "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [...] a kid born in the same city as me — it almost felt predestined", Shyamalan said. [...] "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".|$|E

2500|$|Shyamalan {{commented on}} the issues {{regarding}} fans' perceptions of the casting {{in an interview with}} Washington Post columnist Jen Chaney, saying, [...] "Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [...] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> I don't know what else to do." [...] In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as [...] "American Indian," [...] although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply [...] "white" [...] when making their complaints.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2014, former NBC {{facilities}} manager Frank Scotti told the New York Daily News that {{while working on}} The Cosby Show, Cosby funneled regular payments to several women via money orders that Scotti was told to purchase in his own name. Among the women identified in receipts that Scotti preserved for more than 20 years were Shawn Thompson, Cosby's admitted mistress who later accused him of fathering her child, and Angela Leslie, who claimed Cosby made unwanted sexual advances toward her in the early 1990s. Scotti [...] "suspected that [...] was having sex with them". He also noted that Cosby [...] "was covering himself by having <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> [...] <b>It</b> was a coverup". Scotti also claimed that Cosby regularly took aspiring models and actresses into his dressing room and instructed Scotti, [...] "Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in." [...] In a later interview for NBCs Today Show, Scotti said he [...] "felt like a pimp". Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer denied Scotti's accusations and said the walker-bound 90-year-old was merely seeking [...] "his 15 minutes of fame".|$|R

5000|$|NACA disbanded {{the colored}} {{computing}} pool in 1958 {{when it was}} superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. The installation was desegregated. Society's discrimination against women had not yet ended, however. Johnson recalled that era as follows."We needed to be assertive as women in those days — assertive and aggressive — {{and the degree to}} which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the reports — no woman in my division had had her <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a report.

He had a quarrel with Father, and he was always dreadful high-spirited. He went to sea, and we heard that he had sailed for England in the Helen Ray. She was never heard of after, and we all supposed that my poor brother had perished with her. And four weeks ago I got a letter from a firm of lawyers in Melbourne, Australia, saying that my brother, Charles Bennett, had died and left all his fortune to me. I couldn't believe it at first, but they sent me some things of his that he had when he left home, and there was an old picture of myself among them with <b>my</b> <b>name</b> written <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in <b>my</b> own hand, so then I knew there was no mistake.

6000|$|... ‘Ay, {{but though}} we’re doing well, it’s no’ {{the same as}} if they were a book with your name on it.’ So the ambitious woman would say with a sigh, and I did my best to turn the Auld Licht {{sketches}} into a book with <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Then perhaps we understood most fully how good a friend our editor had been, for just as I had been able to find no well-known magazine—and I think I tried all—which would print any article or story about the poor of my native land, so now the publishers, Scotch and English, refused to accept the book as a gift. I was willing to present it to them, but they would have it in no guise; {{there seemed to be a}} blight on everything that was Scotch. I daresay we sighed, but never were collaborators more prepared for rejection, and though my mother might look wistfully at the scorned manuscript at times and murmur, ‘You poor cold little crittur shut away in a drawer, are you dead or just sleeping?’ she had still her editor to say grace over. And at last publishers, sufficiently daring and far more than sufficiently generous, were found for us by a dear friend, who made one woman very ‘uplifted.’ He also was an editor, and had as large a part in making me a writer of books as the other in determining what the books should be about.|$|E

Speaking to Q magazine, the singer explained how a chance meeting with R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe at a Californian studio rejuvenated his writing process. He recalled, [...] "I couldn't even write <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a cheque. <b>It</b> was that bad {{at the time}} ... (Stipe arriving at the studio) was amazing because the first song I ever played live was R.E.M.'s 'Find the River' at a school concert." [...] Although Stipe's input was minimal, {{it was enough to}} inspire Lightbody to rediscover his muse. He recalled, [...] "Michael just made a few suggestions here and there. On a track called 'New York' there was a line, 'Your face has never left me.' He said, 'That sounds like you've got a girl's head in your bag.' So we changed that." ...|$|R

[...] With one match to play {{at the end of the}} season, Bradford qualified for League Two play-off semi-final. After a win over two legs against Burton Albion, Bradford City were promoted to League One after beating Northampton Town, 3-0.

50|$|Elfick hired Bob Ellis {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} because he had admired The Legend of King O'Malley. Ellis says he wrote the first draft with Howard Rubie, who was a former cameraman for Cinesound and {{thought he was going}} to direct it. Anne Brooksbank later contributed to the script. Noyce was then hired as director and worked with Ellis. Ellis fell out with Noyce and demanded his name be taken off the credits. Ellis:There was some nonsense about how long it was; we'd set it out, one short scene per page and it finally came out about 300 pages or so but, in fact, it was maybe two and a quarter hours long, which wasn't too bad then or now for something that covered 10 years. But a legend started about how huge it was. When I saw it, I was appalled. I could only see what was missing and abruptly took <b>my</b> <b>name</b> off it. Then when it won all the prizes, I sort of shamefacedly put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> back <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> It was a quite painful experience and I think a very good film, but not as good a film as might have been made. One of the models for it was the film, Yanks, which was a moment in history in particular culture perfectly captured. It had a lot more than the politics in it but, partly because of the budget and partly because of the length, it was pruned back to the politics. Now, the politics was all there in the original but it was surrounding other things, such as the way people spent their Christmases. That was removed.Funding was provided by the Australian Film Commission and the New South Wales Film Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|Micheal Day (born October 9, 1984 in Tarzana, California United States) is a {{professional}} American [...] "Current School" [...] Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years are from 2002-Present. His nickname is a play on a common phrase. Mike Day's official Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) number, which was originally assigned {{to him by the}} American Bicycle Association (ABA) (not affiliated to the UCI), he requested for it from and is assigned it by the UCI for life regardless of how he does in a race season, is #365. With the exception of quadrennial leap years, that is the number of days in a calendar year. As a result, a play on his surname [...] "365 Day" [...] occurs from the common phrase [...] "...365 days a year" [...] (alternatively [...] "..365 days per year"): [...] "When you turn pro, they always give you a number in the 300s," [...] he said, [...] "and with <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the back, <b>it</b> said: 365 Day. Everyone talked about it, and I said, ‘That's it. That's going to be my number.' I'll pretty much wear it till I'm done racing." [...] On June 14, 2008 Mike Day won a place on the USA BMX Olympic Team by winning the Team Trial at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. This team will represent the USA in the first ever BMX racing competition in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China with Teammates Kyle Bennett, Donny Robinson, and Jill Kintner. As of August 20, he has made the Semi Finals in the 2008 Summer Olympics, winning both the Seeding Run time trials and was the overall winning of the three runnings of his Quarter Finals, sweeping all three. On August 22, Mike Day won the Silver medal in the Men's BMX Final at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Since the Men's Final was raced after the Women's Final in the sport's debut games, he is the second American ever to win a medal. However, he is also the highest placing. His teammates Jill Kintner and Donny Robinson both won Bronze medals. Kyle Bennett did not qualify for the Finals. Maris Strombergs of Latvia was the winner of the Gold medal.|$|R
