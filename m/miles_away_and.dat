5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Jewitt gives a {{thorough}} {{description of the}} village of Nootka in Friendly Cove, the appearance and construction of the longhouses, and the geography of the surrounding terrain (starting p.59).

With the Nootka Conventions of the 1790s, an agreement signed in Europe and of which the indigenous people knew nothing, the Spanish left and the Nootka returned to their village. The foundations {{of the church and}} the governor's house and the remnants of the kitchen garden were visible during Jewitt's time there.|$|E
25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E
