UFC president Dana White stated that Angle was in talks to appear as a heavyweight contestant on the 10th season of The Ultimate Fighter, but failed the <b>medical</b> <b>requirements.</b> Angle signed with Bellator MMA on October 28, 2015. He attended a fan convention on November 6, the eve of Bellator 145, then joined the commentary booth the next night, during the Bobby Lashley vs. James Thompson match, where he teased possibly fighting for the promotion himself.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent <b>medical</b> <b>requirements,</b> is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

40|$|Objective Physician {{participation}} in Continuing Medical Education programs {{may be influenced}} by a number of factors. To evaluate the factors associated with compliance with the Continuing <b>Medical</b> Education <b>requirements</b> at a private hospital, we investigated whether physicians&# 8217; activity, measured by volumes of admissions and procedures, was associated with obtaining 40 Continuing Medical Education credits (40 hours of activities) in a 12 -month cycle. Methods In an exclusive and non-mandatory Continuing Medical Education program, we collected physicians&# 8217; numbers of hospital admissions and numbers of surgical procedures performed. We also analyzed data on physicians&# 8217; time since graduation, age, and gender. Results A total of 3, 809 credentialed, free-standing, private practice physicians were evaluated. Univariate analysis showed that the Continuing <b>Medical</b> Education <b>requirements</b> {{were more likely to be}} achieved by male physicians (odds ratio 1. 251; p= 0. 009) and who had a higher number of hospital admissions (odds ratio 1. 022; p< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis showed that age and number of hospital admissions were associated with achievement of the Continuing <b>Medical</b> Education <b>requirements.</b> Each hospital admission increased the chance of achieving the requirements by 0. 4 %. Among physicians who performed surgical procedures, multivariate analysis showed that male physicians were 1. 3 time more likely to achieve the Continuing <b>Medical</b> Education <b>requirements</b> than female physicians. Each surgical procedure performed increased the chance of achieving the requirements by 1. 4 %. Conclusion The numbers of admissions and number of surgical procedures performed by physicians at our hospital were associated with the likelihood of meeting the Continuing <b>Medical</b> Education <b>requirements.</b> These findings help to shed new light on our Continuing Medical Education program...|$|R
25|$|The union, {{faced with}} a {{challenge}} to its very existence, threatened to strike if the Mayor went through with this plan. With {{the support of the}} national CIO, the union was able to maintain its collective bargaining agreements and the right to represent the IRT and BMT employees after the City took over those systems in 1940. The union soon found itself struggling with the special problems of creating a civil service system for thousands of employees, while providing representation for thousands of workers who faced problems with meeting the City's new naturalization and <b>medical</b> <b>requirements.</b> But the union lost ground among its members, both in terms of actual numbers after it lost the closed shop and in terms of actual support, since many workers who may have remained members saw the union as less important now that they had the seeming job security that civil service status promised and the union had lost the right to strike.|$|E

On 8May Hines successfully rejoined the AIF, this time giving an age of 36 years and seven months. By this stage of the war <b>medical</b> <b>requirements</b> were less strict due to the need for reinforcements to make good the AIF's casualties. Hines was assigned to the 45th Battalion and departed Sydney for Europe onboard HMAT A18 Wiltshire on 22 August 1916.|$|E
500|$|The {{body was}} {{supposed}} to be the victim of an aeroplane crash, and it was decided that to try and simulate the accident at sea using flares and other devices could be too risky and open to discovery. After seaplanes and surface ships were dismissed as being problematic, a submarine was chosen as the method of delivering the corpse to the region. To transport the body by submarine, it needed to be contained within the body of the boat, as any externally mounted container would have to be built with a skin so thick it would alter the level of the waterline. The canister needed to remain airtight and keep the corpse as fresh as possible through its journey. Spilsbury provided the <b>medical</b> <b>requirements</b> and Cholmondeley contacted Charles Fraser-Smith of the Ministry of Supply to produce the container, which was labelled [...] "Handle with care: optical instruments".|$|E

500|$|Between 1929 and 1937, {{the number}} of {{soldiers}} within the Militia who could provide effective service was well below the force's actual on paper strength as many soldiers were unable to attend even a six-day annual camp {{out of fear of}} losing their civilian employment. Also {{it has been estimated that}} up to 50 per cent of the Militia's other ranks were medically unfit. The numbers situation had become so tenuous that it was rare for a battalion to be able to field even 100 men during an exercise, so units accepted men that would not normally meet the <b>medical</b> <b>requirements,</b> indeed it has been stated that men who were [...] "lame and practically blind" [...] were allowed to join in an effort to improve numbers. To illustrate this, in 1936, the largest battalionâ€”the 30th/51st Battalionâ€”had just 412 personnel of all ranks, while the 11th/16th Battalion, which was the smallest, had only 156 men.|$|E

2500|$|Navigator was {{recognized}} by the United States Army Air Forces as a rating and authorized its own badge on 4 September 1942, {{one of a number}} of new wartime ratings that included Bombardier, the Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot and Service Pilot ratings (N.B.: these three ratings were typically awarded to soldiers on the basis of prior civilian flying experience, with a higher age limit and relaxed <b>medical</b> <b>requirements</b> for entry vs. the normal Pilot training pipeline; their duty assignments were limited in scope), and enlisted Aircrew ratings. Combat Observer was renamed Aircraft Observer. All of the wartime ratings except Navigator were discontinued by the USAF on 26 July 1949, with Navigator and Bombardier merged into a single Navigator rating and the badge design being changed in 1951 from that of an armillary sphere flanked by wings to that of the USAF shield flanked by wings. [...] At this time, a tiered system of ratings based on hours and years of service was also implemented with Senior Navigator and Master Navigator following the same precepts as Senior Pilot and Command Pilot.|$|E
