5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E

25|$|A coin is a small, flat, (usually) round {{piece of}} metal or plastic used {{primarily}} as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> or legal tender.

25|$|The use of {{historical}} money in Tibet started in ancient times, when Tibet had no coined currency of its own. Bartering was common, gold was a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> and shell money and stone beads {{were used for}} very small purchases.

50|$|Example of {{commodities}} {{that have been}} used as <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> include gold, silver, copper, salt, peppercorns, tea, large stones (such as Rai stones), decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, cocoa beans, cowries and barley. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.|$|R
2500|$|Adam Fergusson {{pointed out}} that in 1923, during the great Inflation in the Weimar Republic Gresham's Law began to work in reverse, as the {{official}} money became so worthless that virtually nobody would take it.

5000|$|Prior to the Civil War, the U.S. {{operated}} on a gold standard in practice. Bank notes were legal tender issued by state banks {{which could be}} exchanged for an amount of gold at any bank. Both gold and bank notes circulated as <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> On February 25, 1862, the U.S. passed the First Legal Tender Act to help finance the Civil War. The act changed the economy to a fiduciary standard based on a fiat currency called United States Notes, or more popularly called greenbacks. Unlike bank notes, greenbacks were not backed by any sort of metallic standard and acted almost like a [...] "loan without interest". Greenbacks were issued as an immediate, short-term relief for the country's growing demand for currency. The issuance of greenbacks and the sale of government bonds to finance the war were led by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Salmon P. Chase. Until 1879, gold, bank notes, and greenbacks were used as <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and had free floating exchange rates.|$|R

25|$|Currency {{withdrawn}} from circulation remains legal tender, {{but this does}} not obligate any creditor to accept it as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> Withdrawn currency is usually exchanged at commercial bank branches, though some banks require that exchangers be bank customers.

25|$|The bracteates {{were usually}} called back regularly, about {{once or twice}} a year, and could be {{exchanged}} for new coins with a deduction (Renovatio Monetae). This system worked like a demurrage: People wouldn't hoard their coins, because they lost their value. So this money was used more as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> than for storing value. This increased the velocity of money and stimulated the economy.|$|E

25|$|To {{act as a}} {{store of}} value, a money {{must be able to}} be {{reliably}} saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.|$|E
25|$|The {{exchange}} of slaves, molasses, and rum was quite profitable, and the disruption {{to the trade}} caused by the Sugar Act in 1764 may have even helped cause the American Revolution.

25|$|First, {{citizens}} must {{support the}} Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion {{and the target}} whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{in violation of the}} country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.|$|E

40|$|Inflation {{management}} {{is one of}} the hardest tasks an economic policymaker has to undertake. It appears, at first sight, that one can rely entirely on commonsense to carry out this task. But that will be a cardinal mistake. While inflation policy does require judgment and intuition, it is essential that these be backed up with statistical information and an understanding of economic theory. This paper tries to bring together the formal analytics that underlie inflation policy. It surveys some of the standard ideas and also questions some of these and, in the process, tries to push further outwards the frontiers of our understanding. inflation, economic theory, policy, statistical information, management, policymaker, India, inclusive development, policy, Indian economy, prices, labour, goods, <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> data collection, theoretical research, Europe...|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the many}} issues {{associated}} with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become [...] "the silent majority," [...] an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that moral universalism (human rights, equality) is equated with globalization, which is not concerned with immutable values but with <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and equalisation such as the global market and mass media.|$|R

25|$|Trade is the {{voluntary}} {{exchange of goods}} and services, and {{is a form of}} economics. A mechanism that allows trade is called a market. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Because of specialization and division of labor, most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an absolute or comparative advantage in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of mass production.|$|E
