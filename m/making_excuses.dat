5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|Lionel is {{sentenced to}} prison for his parents' murder in season four. Lionel {{attempts}} to switch bodies with Lex using a stone from Clark's homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches bodies with Clark instead. When he and Clark switch back, Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed. Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague (Jane Seymour), and begins searching for three stones of knowledge. During this quest, Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge. Lionel recovers from his catatonic state in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor-El takes over his body to speak with Clark. With Jor-El guiding him, Lionel begins helping Clark by <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for Clark's behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six. Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society called Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as the Traveler (Clark). When the secret is uncovered, Lex murders his father, realizing he has been covering up the Traveler's existence.|$|E

25|$|The debacle {{over the}} final section of NY214 dragged into 1953 and soon 1954, when the {{residents}} of Lanesville pressed New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey to take action on the stalled project. The federal appropriation of aid would expire on June 30, 1955 and the committee noted that the state had been making empty promises since February 1952. They pressured Dewey {{to take steps to}} expedite the project, as the Public Works department had been <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> from federal aid, to engineer shortages, to lack of money, approval by Greene County and that the state must match the amount of the federal government provided. By May, the committee turned their requests to United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his support on the highway. Eisenhower referred the letter to the Bureau of Public Roads who noted that while the money was still there, it hinged on documents that were never sent regarding the right-of-way in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared Stiff, with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in the years ahead, at the time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too steamy. Despite Scott's best efforts, including <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the negative experience and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E

25|$|The equites and two senators, Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Scribonius Curio {{supported}} Cicero. They assembled on the Capitol {{and sent}} envoys to the consuls {{and the senate}} on his behalf. Lucius Ninnius tried to rally popular support. However, Clodius prevented him from taking any action. Aulus Gabinius barred the equites from accessing the senate, drove one of them who was persistent {{out of the city}} and rebuked Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio. Calpurnius Piso advised Cicero that leaving Rome was the only way for him to be safe. Cicero took offence. Caesar condemned the illegality of the action taken in 63 BC, but did not approve the punishment proposed by the law because it was not fitting for any law to deal with past events. Crassus had shown some support through his son, but he sided with the people. Pompey promised help, but he kept <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> and kept making journeys out of Rome. Cicero got scared, considered resorting to arms and slighted Pompey openly. However, he was stopped by Cato and Hortensius, for fear of a civil war. Cicero left for Sicily, where he had been a governor, hoping to find sympathy there. On that day the law was passed without opposition. It was supported even by people who had actively helped Cicero. His property was confiscated and his house was demolished. Then Clodius carried a law that specified the terms of Cicero’s banishment. This banned him from a radius of 500 miles from Rome and both he and those who harboured him could be killed with impunity. Therefore, he went to Greece.|$|E
500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|E
500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> when I say that in the first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a coat of paint. The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without really knowing what it was all about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E

500|$|A superhero who is {{commissioned}} by the U.S. government as a black-ops specialist. When reading the comic for the part, Morgan stopped when he saw his character was killed off three pages in. When telling his agent {{he did not want}} the part, he was told to continue reading it and find out how important his character was. Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't hate this guy even though he does things that are unmentionable. [...] My job is to kind of make that translate, so as a viewer you end up not <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> to like him, but you don't hate him like you should for doing the things that he does." [...] Of his casting, Snyder said, [...] "It's hard to find a man's man in Hollywood. It just is. And Jeffrey came in and was grumpy and cool and grizzled, and I was, like, 'OK, Jeffrey is perfect!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Paper Trail {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Several critics praised the production on the album; Andy Kellman of AllMusic noted that DJ Toomp's and Danja's production appearance provided [...] "some much needed punch", which placed the album above T.I.'s previous album, T.I. vs. T.I.P.. Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly {{said that the}} [...] "outstanding production" [...] proved that T.I. [...] "still knows {{how to have a}} good time". Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine called the songs produced by Toomp the [...] "vintage T.I.", describing the sound as [...] "ecstasies of sweltering synth lines, ground-shaking 808 patterns and breathless verbalizing". However, McBee felt that the songs that were directly about T.I.'s prison sentence for weapons charges ("No Matter What", [...] "Ready for Whatever") were among the weakest on the album, saying that [...] "admitting guilt, <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> and expressing no regrets falls flat". Sharing a similar sentiment, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the songs [...] "mostly dispenses with the Tupac-wannabe gangsta-confessor pretensions to deliver catchy, tight, bombastic pop-rap alongside a who's-who of megastar guests", saying that T.I. was a [...] "well-oiled hit machine who's more fun than deep".|$|E
2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in <b>making</b> <b>excuses.</b> [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time. [...] It's {{very difficult for me to}} watch it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time just to see how it stands up.|$|E

2500|$|A {{review of}} {{qualitative}} research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use cognitive distortions to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by <b>making</b> <b>excuses,</b> redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships. Other cognitive distortions include {{the idea of}} [...] "children as sexual beings", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and [...] "sexual entitlement-bias".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Torre opened {{dialogue}} around Major League Baseball amid {{concerns about}} umpiring, {{the strike zone}}, and instant replay, by meeting with players and staff of all 30 major league teams. [...] Red Sox manager John Farrell noted an increasing trend of pitches below the strike zone being called strikes. [...] Commented Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, [...] "it's good leadership that he's willing to initiate conversation, ... giving guys a chance , it's impressive. [...] He wasn't ... <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for anybody. [...] He said, 'Help me understand how we can help improve.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul LaPolice was {{introduced}} as the 28th {{head coach in}} Blue Bombers history on February 5, 2010. The new coach emphasized the idea of [...] "team" [...] and playing for the uniform. He also {{made it a point}} to talk about fixing problems rather than <b>making</b> <b>excuses.</b> [...] The new paradigm was tested in the 2010 season in which the team finished 4–14 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. Nine of those games were lost by four points or fewer, while 10 were lost by a touchdown or less.|$|E
60|$|Twilight of {{a certain}} summer day, many years ago, shaded softly down over the wild Ohio valley {{bringing}} keen anxiety to a traveler on the lonely river trail. He had expected to reach Fort Henry with his party on this night, thus putting a welcome end to the long, rough, hazardous journey through the wilderness; but the swift, on-coming dusk made it imperative to halt. The narrow, forest-skirted trail, difficult to follow in broad daylight, apparently led into gloomy aisles in the woods. His guide had abandoned him that morning, <b>making</b> <b>excuse</b> that his services were no longer needed; his teamster was new to the frontier, and, altogether, the situation caused him much uneasiness.|$|R

2500|$|During {{training}} camp, D. J. Mbenga was {{not able}} to participate fully in practice due to a [...] "malalignment of his hips/hip flexors". The imbalance was causing him pain in his abdominal, groin and hip flexor areas. He made a full recovery and played on opening night. Pau Gasol injured his hamstring during a preseason game and missed the first 12 games of the season. In December, Ron Artest revealed that he suffered a shoulder injury during the Lakers' opening exhibition game. He kept the injury quiet so it wouldn't seem like he was <b>making</b> <b>excuses,</b> telling neither the media nor his coaches.|$|E
2500|$|Claymoor {{earned more}} respect as a pioneer cinema critic: in 1896–1897, {{he was among}} the first to chronicle the {{earliest}} Romanian film shows and, as film historian Dinu-Ioan Nicola argues, had [...] "surprising critical intuitions." [...] Having been present at a screening of Paul Menu's [...] "Romanian vistas" [...] in May 1897, Claymoor prophesied that [...] "cinema will reestablish truth and the sincerity of our lives will be transmitted over the ages, beyond ourselves. To us it is entertainment. To future generations, it will be a priceless document". As argued by one anonymous witness, Claymoor was personally involved in film promotion, <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for the technical difficulties and delays. His Carnet, [...] "I believe, has reached the peak of its glory during these days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Along with Sonnet 100, Sonnet 101 is {{recognized}} as one of the only two sonnets in the complete sequence which directly invokes the Muse. [...] These two sonnets in turn are part of the group of four sonnets, 100–103, wherein the poet-speaker deflects blame for his silence from himself onto the Muse, <b>making</b> <b>excuses</b> for having not written or if writing, not writing adequately. [...] Dubrow notes the use here of occupatio, that rhetorical method of announcing a topic which one will not discuss and by that announcement already commencing a discussion of it. [...] On the other hand, Stirling has noted the differences of 100–101 from 102–103 and from the larger group 97–104, and that by removing them, one creates a more cohesive sequence (97–99, 102–104) tied together by [...] "the theme of absence and 'return'".|$|E
