40|$|Abstract: Mail systems {{comprise}} different {{components to}} accomplish all mail activities. On {{the top of}} these mail system functions is the <b>message</b> submission, <b>delivery,</b> and retrieval on a target host. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMPT) is the mail transport protocol used to transfer mail between hosts. In SMTP session, like any protocol, two participants are involved. The first is the client that initiates the session and manages connection by sending requests. The other, which is the server, waits for such requests that trigger responses. This paper presents an enhanced <b>messages</b> <b>delivery</b> approach through a proposed SMTP client. A proposed architecture implementation is presented {{as well as the}} algorithm workflow for processing mails by the SMTP client. The paper provides a per-host grouping strategy that minimizes the <b>delivery</b> time of <b>messages</b> queue to multiple hosts by processing all messages belonging to the same host mail server as a one bulk. A comparative study for <b>messages</b> <b>delivery</b> with and without the grouping mechanism proved a significant reduction the the time for delivering a queue of messages. In addition to grouping, the features contributed in threading and session handling, prioritized delivery, and pipelining enhanced the way and performance of mails delivery to destination hosts...|$|R

40|$|Process {{groups in}} {{distributed}} applications and services rely on failure detectors to detect process failures completely, and as quickly, accurately, and scalably as possible, {{even in the}} face of unreliable <b>message</b> <b>deliveries.</b> In this paper, we look at quantifying the optimal scalability, in terms of network load, (in messages per second, with messages having a size limit) of distributed, complete failure detectors as a function of application-specified requirements. These requirements are 1) quick failure detection by some nonfaulty process, and 2) accuracy of failure detection. We assume a crash-recovery (non-Byzantine) failure model, and a network model that is probabilistically unreliable (w. r. t. <b>message</b> <b>deliveries</b> and process failures). First, we characterize, under certain independence assumptions, the optimum worst-case network load imposed by any failure detector that achieves an application's requirements. We then discuss why traditional heartbeating schemes are inherently unscalable according to the optimal load. We also present a randomized, distributed, failure detector algorithm that imposes an equal expected load per group member. This protocol satisfies the application defined constraints of completeness and accuracy, and speed of detection on an average. It imposes a network load that di#ers from the optimal by a sub-optimality factor that is much lower than that for traditional distributed heartbeating schemes. Moreover, this sub-optimality factor does not vary with group size (for large groups) ...|$|R
