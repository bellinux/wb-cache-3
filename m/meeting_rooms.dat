40|$|In video based cross-model {{analysis}} of planning meeting, the meeting events are recorded by multiple cameras {{distributed in the}} entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> Subject’s hand gestures, hand motion, head orientations, gaze targets, body poses are {{very important for the}} meeting event analysis. In order to register everything to the same global coordinate system, build 3 D model, get 3 D data from the video, we need to create a proper <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration and calibrate all cameras to obtain their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. However, the calibration of multiple cameras distributed in the entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> area is a challenging task because it is impossible to let all cameras in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> see a reference object {{at the same time and}} wide field-of-view cameras suffer under radial distortion. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to create a good <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration and calibrate multiple cameras in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> The proposed approach includes several steps. First, we create stereo camera pairs according to the room configuration and the requirements of the targets, the participants of the meeting. Second, we apply Tsai’s algorithm to calibrate each stereo camera pair and obtain the parameters in its own local coordinate system. Third, we use Vicon motion capture data to transfer all local coordinate systems of stereo camera pairs into a global coordinate system in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> We can obtain the positions, orientations, and parameters for all cameras in the same global coordinate system, so that we can register everything into this global coordinate system. Next, we do calibration error analysis for the current camera and <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration. We can obtain error distribution in the entire <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> area. Finally, we improve the current camera and <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> configuration according to the error dis...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{calibration}} of head pose estimation in stereo camera setting for <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> video event analysis. Head pose information infers {{the direction of}} attention of the subjects in video, therefore is valuable for video event analysis/indexing, especially in <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> scenario. We are developing a multi-modal <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> data analyzing system for studying <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> interaction dynamics, in which head pose estimation {{is one of the}} key components. As each subject in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> can be observed by a pair of stereo cameras, we do 2 D head tracking for the subject in each camera, and the 3 D coordinate of the head can be obtained by triangulation. The 3 D head pose is estimated in one of the camera coordinate system, we develop a procedure to accurately convert the estimated 3 D pose in the camera coordinate system to that in the world coordinate system. In the experiment, visualization of the estimated head pose and location in world coordinate system verifies the soundness of our design. The estimated head pose and 3 D location of the subjects in the <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> allows further analysis of <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> interaction dynamics, such as F-formation, Floor-control[1], etc. 1...|$|R

The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests.

5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon.

5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other <b>meeting</b> <b>rooms,</b> and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Baths of Caracalla {{began in}} 211 {{at the start}} of Caracalla's rule. The baths are named for Caracalla, though it is most {{probable}} that his father was responsible for their planning. In 216 a partial inauguration of the baths took place, but the outer perimeter of the baths was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander. These large baths were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes for social and state activities in large densely populated cities. The baths covered around 50 acres (or 202,000 square meters) of land and could accommodate around 1,600 bathers at any one time. They were the second largest public baths built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools, exercise yards, a stadium, steam rooms, libraries, <b>meeting</b> <b>rooms,</b> fountains, and other amenities, all of which were enclosed within formal gardens. The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors, columns, mosaics, and colossal statuary.|$|E

There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items.

5|$|Fire Station Number 4 or Fire Station No. 4 is a {{historic}} fire station located at 474 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The building historically has also been called the Collyer Fire Station. The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone lintels and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current Fire Station Number 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and <b>meeting</b> <b>rooms</b> {{by the time of}} its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and <b>meeting</b> <b>rooms,</b> and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E
