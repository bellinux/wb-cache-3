5|$|However, another stereochemical {{transition}} effect equally {{capable of}} producing inversion or retention products is whether the <b>migrating</b> group remains on the original face of the π system after rebonding or instead transfers to the opposite face of the π system. If the <b>migrating</b> group remains on the same face of the π system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the <b>migrating</b> group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.|$|E

To <b>migrate</b> abroad for education and definitely return <b>migrate</b> (respectively to <b>migrate</b> abroad for education, return <b>migrate</b> when adult, and <b>migrate</b> again when old) is possible if the life-cycle indirect utility is higher than the life-cycle indirect utilities of each other cases, including those in M_∅. The major difficulty in studying the convergence of the dynamics of these two cases is that prices will change over time with migration flows so that an individual must anticipate all possible movements prior to make the decision to <b>migrate</b> and return <b>migrate.</b> Nothing indicates that in an overlapping generations model with three periods, each economy reaches a post-migration steady-state equilibrium.|$|R

25|$|The northernmost {{subspecies}} C. c. bromia is migratory, {{subject to}} necessity. It may withdraw several hundred kilometres {{south in the}} northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to <b>migrate</b> in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It <b>migrates</b> during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds.

Young jays {{may be more likely to}} <b>migrate</b> than adults, but many adults also <b>migrate.</b> Some individual jays <b>migrate</b> south one year, stay north the next winter, and then <b>migrate</b> south again the next year.

Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.|$|R

5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples <b>migrating</b> from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or <b>migrating</b> to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E
