5|$|Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they}} also prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> in total.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> are {{earless seals}} {{of the tribe}} Monachini. They are the only earless seals found in {{tropical}} climates. There are two genera of <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal, Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E

The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme.

5|$|Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{were found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> are polygynous. The {{breeding}} season takes place throughout the year, excluding the fall, but peaks during April and May.

The monument receives strict conservation protection, with exceptions for traditional Native Hawaiian uses and limited tourism.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{split from}} other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene. Their {{evolutionary}} link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of †Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, †Puijila {{had a long}} tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. The lineages of Otariidae (eared seals) and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya. Phocids (earless seals) {{are known to have}} existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (<b>monk</b> <b>seals)</b> and Phocinae lineages 22 mya.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E
