For example, a breakfast cereal containing hazelnuts and dried fruit plus two relatively cheap ingredients, could be weighed on a <b>multihead</b> with say eight heads devoted to each of the more expensive components and four heads to each of the other two. This would ensure high weighing speed while ensuring that overfilling of the expensive ingredients was negligible.|$|E

50|$|The {{range of}} bags {{which can be}} filled using <b>multihead</b> weighers is immense. At {{one end of the}} scale are large {{catering}} packs of many kilogrammes. At the other are small bags of crisps which can be handled at high speed and efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Ishida is a Japanese {{multinational}} company which manufactures food packing machinery. It {{has been in}} business since 1893 and remains a privately owned family business. It invented the <b>multihead</b> weigher and today its product range includes weighing, packing and inspection equipment and entire packing line solutions for food and non-food industries.|$|E
50|$|A ‘typical target’ weight per pack {{might be}} 100 grams of a product. The product is fed {{to the top}} of the <b>multihead</b> weigher where it is {{dispersed}} to the pool hoppers. Each pool hopper drops the product into a weigh hopper beneath it as soon as the weigh hopper becomes empty.|$|E
50|$|PFM designs, builds {{and markets}} around 40 models of flow-wrapping and {{vertical}} form-fill-seal machines together with various automatic feed systems and <b>multihead</b> weighers. Machines are produced for various {{sectors of the}} food industry from dairy, which is its most significant sector, to meat, confectionery, bakery goods, fruit and vegetables as well as non-food industries such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.|$|E
50|$|The weigher’s {{computer}} {{determines the}} weight of product in each individual weigh hopper and identifies which combination contains the weight closest to the target weight of 100g. The <b>multihead</b> weigher opens all the hoppers of this combination and the product falls, via a discharge chute, into a bagmaker or, alternatively, into a distribution system which places the product, for example, into trays.|$|E
50|$|The Highways Agency {{have their}} National Traffic Control Centre in Quinton between the M5 and A456 near {{junction}} 3.

50|$|Today {{this kind}} of machine, thanks to its high speed and accuracy, has widely spread in the {{packaging}} industry and is produced worldwide {{by a number of}} manufacturers. Some manufacturers offer complete packaging lines, integrating the <b>multihead</b> weigher with other packaging machinery ranging from bagmakers (including Vertical Form Fill and Seal bagmakers) to traysealers and inspection systems. The latter include checkweighers and X-ray inspection systems.|$|E
50|$|Planar techniques, such as {{conventional}} scintigraphy, are rarely used. Rather, Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{is more common}} in the US. With <b>multihead</b> SPECT systems, imaging can often be completed in less than 10 minutes. With SPECT, interior and posterior abnormalities and small areas of infarction can be identified, as well as the occluded blood vessels and the mass of infarcted and viable myocardium.The usual isotopes for such studies are either Thallium-201 or Technetium-99m.|$|E
50|$|For {{enhanced}} {{laser scanning}} applications and/or high material throughput during production, scanning systems {{with more than}} one scanhead are used. Here the software has to control what is done exactly within such a <b>multihead</b> application: it is possible that all available heads have to mark the same to finish processing faster or that the heads mark one single job in parallel where every scanhead performs a part of the job in case of large working areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multihead</b> weighers {{were used}} {{initially}} for weighing certain vegetables.

In 1948 the company was founded under the name Ishida Scales Mfg. Co. Ltd. by Otokichi II Ishida. In 1972 it invented the <b>multihead</b> weigher and first exported it in 1978. In 1985, the first international subsidiary, Ishida Europe, was founded, followed by subsidiaries in Brazil, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Canada, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and India.

Ishida also manufactures cut-gate weighers, for granules and powders, machines for separating stacks of food trays (denesters), tray sealers, snack food bagmakers and other packaging line equipment such as conveyors and gantries. Inspection equipment includes checkweighers, X-ray systems, seal testers and vision systems. Ishida also produces software for packing line efficiency optimisation.

40|$|AbstractWe define {{alternating}} <b>multihead</b> finite automata, a {{generalization of}} nondeterministic <b>multihead</b> finite automata {{based on the}} alternating Turing machine model introduced by Chandra, Kozen, and Stockmeyer (1981). We study {{the relationships between the}} classes of languages accepted by alternating <b>multihead</b> finite automata and the classes accepted by deterministic and nondeterministic <b>multihead</b> finite automata and pushdown automata. We also examine basic questions about alternating <b>multihead</b> finite automata (for example, are k + 1 heads better than k?). We conclude by placing upper bounds on the deterministic time and space complexity of the classes of languages accepted by alternating <b>multihead</b> finite automata. As corollaries to our results about alternating <b>multihead</b> finite automata, we obtain several facts about <b>multihead</b> pushdown automata, indicating that the study of alternating <b>multihead</b> finite automata may lead to useful results about nonalternating automata...|$|E

Next, we represent log-space probabilistic complexity classes as proper hierarchies based on corresponding <b>multihead</b> two-way probabilistic finite automata, and we show their (deterministic log-space) reducibility to the second levels of these hierarchies. We relate the number of heads of a <b>multihead</b> probabilistic finite automaton to the bandwidth of its configuration transition matrix for an input string; partially based on this relation, we find an apparently easier log-space complete problem for PL (the class of languages recognized by log-space unbounded-error probabilistic Turing machines), and we investigate possibil [...] ...|$|E

We investigate a relationship among the accepting powers of SPMHFA's, ASPMHFA's, and ASPMHFA's with only universal states. We next introduce a simple, natural complexity measure for ASPMHFA's, called ‘leaf-size’, and provide a spectrum of complexity classes of ASPMHFA's, based on simultaneously leaf-size, the number of heads, and the move directions of heads.
