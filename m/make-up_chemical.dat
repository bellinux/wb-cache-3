40|$|Soil is {{a natural}} body of mineral and organic {{material}} differentiated into horizons, which differ among themselves {{as well as from}} underlying materials in their morphology, physical <b>make-up,</b> <b>chemical</b> composition and biological characteristics. In Pune city due to industrialization and other anthropogenic activity the soil from its eastern part has been polluted. The The sewage water in the Mula- Mutha River flows through the Manjari village and hence it is felt necessary to carry out the soil analysis to understand the pollution levels of the soils in the adjoining area. Since plants depend on the soils for their nutrients, water and minerals supply, the soil type is a major factor in determining what types of plants will grow in a any area. In the present study the analyses of soil samples collected from the sugarcane field of Manjari, Hadapsar, and Phursungi located in the SE part of the Pune city which is influenced by the solid waste disposal as well as industrial effluents. In the first place soils samples from 12 representative locations were collected for their analysis. Physical parameters like pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (%) and chemical parameters like phosphorus, potassium, copper, iron, manganese, zinc and boron were anlyzed. From this study it has been revealed that there is excessive dose of phosphorous and potassium into the soil because most farmers are using excessive chemical fertilizers. Similarly Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn concentration has also been seen higher than the normal range and due to poorer drainage conditions of this area making soi...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{incentives}} {{for making the}} pulp washing process as efficient as possible: an efficient separation of the pulp from the black liquor will save {{a substantial amount of}} energy, reduce costs by reducing the need for <b>make-up</b> <b>chemicals</b> and improve the bleaching process. There are many discrepancies in the literature, however, as to how different parameters influence washing efficiency. It was thought that a new measurement technique which enables the concentration of different species to be measured inside the pulp bed during the washing process, would provide new data that could shed some light over the area of pulp washing. It was shown that the measurement technique worked well for the materials tested: sulphite, sulphate and mechanical pulp and calcium silicate, respectively. The equipment functions better for materials with a long washing time, (i. e. calcium silicate and mechanical pulp) since the measurement error is dependent on the measurement time. Local dispersion coefficients could be calculated for mechanical pulp; it was shown that the local dispersion coefficient {{at the top of the}} bed was influenced by inlet mixing. The filtrate measurements showed that the washing of mechanical pulp beds differs substantially from that of sulphite and sulphate pulp beds. The dispersion coefficient for mechanical pulp was, on average, a factor of 10 smaller than the dispersion coefficients for the chemical pulp. The explanation for this can be found in the difference in bed structure due to differences in fibre properties...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{incentives}} {{for making the}} pulp washing process as efficient as possible: an efficient separation of the pulp from the black liquor will increase energy efficiency, reduce costs by minimizing the need for <b>make-up</b> <b>chemicals</b> and improve the bleaching process. Research in this area has, however, been more or less neglected and in the existing literature there are many discrepancies as to how different parameters influence the washing process. A more systematic way of studying pulp washing was therefore required. A new measurement technique which {{makes it possible to}} measure concentrations and porosity within the pulp bed during the washing process was therefore developed. The measurement technique has been used for kraft, sulphite and mechanical pulps and calcium silicate (validation experiment). The technique worked well for all of the materials, but especially so for materials where the washing process took a long time, since the measurement error is dependent on the measuring time. The new measurement technique was used to obtain local displacement curves. The displacement curves were used to calculate local dispersion coefficients which were compared with the dispersion coefficients obtained from measurements on the resulting filtrate. The local dispersion coefficients in general followed the same trends as the filtrate dispersion coefficients. Using the new measurement technique the influence of washing efficiency on pulp type, flocculation and the presence of a porosity gradient was examined. It was thereafter investigated how compressing kraft pulp to different dry contents with variations in pH and temperature influences its strength properties. The finding was that if the alkali content and the temperature were kept low, compaction did not cause any permanent damage even though the compression pressure was high. A simulation study was performed in order to investigate how compressing the pulp before washing influenced the wash process and it was shown that the dilution factor could be reduced substantially whilst the cleanliness of the exiting pulp suspension remained the same leading to a substantial cost reduction...|$|R

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} mills are high power {{consuming}} industries. Pulp and integrated mills produce power via steam turbines in recovery boilers. Due to high power {{prices and the}} fact that biomass combusted in the recovery boiler is considered as green energy, there is today a desire to always increase the power generation when investing in new recovery boilers. In order to increase power output from the steam turbine the steam data (i. e temperature and pressure) needs to be increased. With higher steam temperature follows a higher risk of corrosion due to the non process element potassium in the boiler fuel. The uncertainties of high temperature corrosion and the unpredictable environment in the furnace makes it difficult to design recovery boilers. This results in higher investment cost and could lead to less profit for the mill buying the boiler. The question then stands whether the revenue obtained from the higher power generation, is higher than the investment made for the upgrade in order to produce the higher steam data over a certain time. And more specifically what steam data will be the most economical, when comparing revenue from power generation with investment cost? In this study, together with ÅF Industry AB, four boilers with different steam data (Boiler A: 38. 5 bar, 450 °C; Boiler B: 92 bar, 480 °C; Boiler C: 106 bar, 500 °C; Boiler D: 115 bar, 515 °C) were compared. The boilers were compared for four potassium levels: 1. 0 wt%, 1. 5 wt%, 2. 5 wt%, 3. 5 wt%. And two values of power were used, 300 SEK/MWh and 700 SEK/MWh. The marginal differences between the boilers were: the amount of material used in the superheaters in order to produce different steam data; the type of material used in the superheaters and the furnace; whether an ash-treatment system was needed (in order to purge potassium from the process); the turbines and generators; whether a feed water demineralization equipment was needed; the yearly cost for <b>make-up</b> <b>chemicals</b> (due to usage of an ash-treatment system) and the amount of power generated. The boilers investment cost and net yearly revenue were compared {{in order to determine the}} marginal pay-off in years. The most economical choice of boiler for the different potassium levels for 300 SEK/MWh: 1. 0 wt%, Boiler D; 1. 5 wt%, Boiler C; 2. 5 wt%, Boiler B; 3. 5 wt%, Boiler D (A). And for 700 SEK/MWh: 1. 0 wt%, Boiler D; 1. 5 wt%, Boiler C; 2. 5 wt%, Boiler D (B); 3. 5 wt%, Boiler D. The conclusion in this thesis was that the deciding factor is whether the boiler is in need of an ash-treatment system. Higher steam data is preferable as long as ash-treatment can be avoided. However, when comparing two boilers with ash-treatment the one with higher steam data is more feasible. Low steam data, such as boiler A, will never be feasible, regardless of potassium level and value of power...|$|R
