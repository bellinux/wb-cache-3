5|$|A French fry {{vending machine}} is a vending machine that {{dispenses}} hot French fries, {{also known as}} chips. The first known french fry vending <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.|$|E

500|$|Broaching <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} simple as {{they only have}} to move the broach in a linear motion at a predetermined speed and provide a means for handling the broach automatically. Most <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> hydraulic, but a few specialty <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> mechanically driven. The <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> distinguished by whether their motion is horizontal or vertical. The choice of <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> primarily dictated by the stroke required. Vertical broaching machines rarely have a stroke longer than [...]|$|R
30|$|Machines have a {{predetermined}} orientation (i.e., <b>machines</b> may <b>be</b> located either horizontally or vertically). The <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> horizontally located if the longer {{side of the}} <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> parallel to the x-axis. On the contrary, the <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> vertically located if the longer side {{is parallel to the}} y-axis.|$|R
40|$|Being {{fueled by}} continual {{development}} of permanent-magnet (PM) materials and machine structures, PM <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> becoming attractive {{for a wide}} range of applications. In this article, the magnet-materials that have been used for PM <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> first introduced. Then, the classification of various PM <b>machines</b> <b>is</b> discussed.

30|$|In essence, the Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> a Java virtual <b>machine,</b> but it <b>is</b> very {{different}} from the general Java virtual machine. The main differences are: (1) the system architecture of the Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> different from the Java virtual machine. The Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> based on virtual registers and the Java virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> based on stack. (2) The instruction set of the Dalvik virtual machine (Dalvik byte code) is also completely different from the Java virtual machine (Java byte code). The Dalvik virtual <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> the key part of the whole system. In the process of dynamic taint tracking, most taint communication happens in this part.|$|R

5|$|The He 111Z's {{operational}} {{history was}} minimal. One <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> caught by RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and was shot down. Eight {{were shot down}} or destroyed {{on the ground in}} 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards. It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.|$|E

5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens {{to build a}} similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E
5|$|The <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{built with}} {{drawings}} from the Danish living history museum Middelaldercentret, who, in 1989, {{were the first}} to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet. It was built in Wiltshire with expertise from the Danish museum.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
50|$|Creep <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> most {{commonly}} used in experiments to determine how efficient and stable a material <b>is.</b> The <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> used by students and companies to create a creep curve on how much pressure and stress a material can handle.

50|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} the {{manufacture}} of many metal products, {{but it can also be}} used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites. A person who specializes in <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> called a machinist. A room, building, or company where <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> done <b>is</b> called a <b>machine</b> shop. Much of modern-day <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.|$|R

5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{teacher at}} Xavier's {{school and the}} X-Mansion's doctor, Jean has begun to {{experience}} vast and at times uncontrollable growth in her telepathic and telekinetic abilities since Magneto's <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in the first film.

5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Manual or {{semi-automatic}} machines {{offer more}} control of shot quality.

Manual <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> more popular in Europe, where it is more common to drink straight espresso.|$|R

5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have invented a perpetual motion machine.

5000|$|Hierarchical state <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> finite state <b>machines</b> whose states {{themselves}} can <b>be</b> other <b>machines.</b> Since a communicating finite state <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> characterized by concurrency, {{the most notable}} trait in a communicating hierarchical state <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency.
