5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> right.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} {{in an interview with}} TV Guide, in which he said he did [...] "research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [...] it's really appalling." [...] Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and [...] "he will be sorry he ever made it." [...] Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: [...] " [...] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh." [...] On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: [...] "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> right. I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show—not 60 Minutes. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this." ...|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

40|$|Implementation of {{supervisory}} control in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) typically {{requires that the}} underlying discrete event models of plant, specification {{as well as the}} supervisor itself fulfil a number of properties. These properties are discussed and methods for solving related problems are given. In particular, determinism and synchronisation issues are investigated. In a manufacturing system, for instance, there are typically a set of processes using a set of shared resources. Uncareful modelling may cause the system model to become nondeterministic. This can be circumvented by relabelling the relevant models. For industrial-sized models, though, this <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> automatically, <b>something</b> that we achieve by parameterising the models. Given a deterministic model, consisting of several interacting entities, we discuss its PLC-based implementation. In addition to the synchronisation of plant and supervisor, a modular supervisor <b>must</b> <b>be</b> internally synchronised. However, synchronisation of the submodules is not well defined in the PLC-world. This may be achieved by using event monitors and an immediate transit/immediate action execution model...|$|R

Over twenty years ago, Calvin Mooers commented: "An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it. " Mooers was involved with information storage and retrieval systems in science, but his words are just as appropriate for management information systems (MIS). The problem with having information in Mooer's view is that you can't just let it sit there if it indicates that <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> If that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> hard to <b>do</b> or involves difficult social consequences (such as disrupting the faculty's habits of library use, or the student's timing of meeting his date), it will only cause ulcers, sleepless nights or unemployment if you don't make the adjustment. Of course there is one way to avoid all of the trouble, and that is not to have the information in the first place. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
