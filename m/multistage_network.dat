The proposed network employs a pipelined circuit-switching approach combined with a dynamic path-setup scheme under a <b>multistage</b> <b>network</b> topology. The dynamic path-setup scheme enables runtime path arrangement for arbitrary traffic permutations. The circuit-switching approach offers a guarantee of permuted data and its compact overhead enables the benefit of stacking multiple networks. Interconnection of various processing elements with guaranteed traffic permutation and optimality of Scheduling over the Network-On-Chip {{has been reported in}} this paper. It supports to reduce the complexity of on chip network implementation.

However, recent works {{have demonstrated that}} RUFT, a traffic-balancing routing algorithm on a Unidirectional <b>Multistage</b> <b>Network</b> (UMIN), can perform {{as well as a}} Bidirectional <b>Multistage</b> <b>Network,</b> but significantly reducing both implementation and operating costs.

RUFT resembles the classical unidirectional Butterfly topology, but with a different connection pattern between switches from the last stage and cores. This work provides a comparison in terms of performance and implementation costs between both topologies, RUFT and unidirectional Butterfly for on-chip interconnects. Our high level and post-layout analysis shows that RUFT is a much more convenient alternative than traditional Butterfly when laying out on silicon. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractÐAll-to-all {{personalized}} {{exchange is}} one of the most dense collective communication patterns and occurs in many important applications in parallel computing. Previous all-to-all personalized exchange algorithms were mainly developed for hypercube and mesh/torus networks. Although the algorithms for a hypercube may achieve optimal time complexity, the network suffers from unbounded node degrees and thus has poor scalability in terms of I/O port limitation in a processor. On the other hand, a mesh/torus has a constant node degree and better scalability in this aspect, but the all-to-all personalized exchange algorithms have higher time complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to efficient all-to-all personalized exchange by considering another important type of networks, multistage networks, for parallel computing systems. We present a new all-to-all personalized exchange algorithm for a class of unique-path, self-routable multistage networks. We first develop a generic method for decomposing all-to-all personalized exchange patterns into some permutations which are realizable in these networks, and then present a new all-to-all personalized exchange algorithm based on this method. The newly proposed algorithm has O 8 ̆ 5 n time complexity for an n n network, which is optimal for all-to-all personalized exchange. By taking advantage of fast switch setting of self-routable switches and the property of a single input/output port per processor in a <b>multistage</b> <b>network,</b> we believe that a <b>multistage</b> <b>network</b> could be a better choice for implementing all-to-all personalized exchange due to its shorter communication latency and better scalability.

When evaluating the coherence protocol performance, the operations of both the cache coherence protocol and interconnection network are considered simultaneously.
