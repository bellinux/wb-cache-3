40|$|All honors {{programs}} {{face the}} problem of making their institution’s student body aware of the program’s existence, its eligibility requirements, curriculum, and benefits. Directors who are already comfortable {{with the number of}} the program’s members and applicants do not need to think much about awareness, publicity, and advertising. For example, the college’s admissions department assists many honors programs in their recruitment. However, some directors must think hard and carefully about campus-wide awareness. These directors will naturally consider some type of advertising method. However, both before and after turning to advertising, directors need to address two important questions. Before embarking on an advertising campaign, they need to know why eligible students are not applying. After the campaign, they need to know how effective the advertising methods were. We will provide a template for other honors programs to use in answering both of these questions by describing a planned marketing research evaluation of a program’s image among the student body and of our advertising efforts. Advertising is defined as the communication of persuasive information about products, services, or ideas by identified sponsors through the various media (Bovee 2 ̆ 6 Thill 9). Typical examples of advertising seen on campuses include advertisements from external sources (soft drink and credit card companies) and advertisements from internal sources (the registrar’s office), and they may take the form of fliers, posters, displays, informational tables at school events or in common areas, or announcements on campus closed-circuit television. Daniel Starch explained in 1923 that, regardless of the medium, advertisers historically have recognized that, to be effective, advertising must be seen, read, believed, remembered, and acted upon. Since Starch, researchers and practitioners in advertising have developed advanced methods to understand the target audience’s attitudes about a product or brand and also the effects of exposure to advertising. These methods are called, respectively, brand equity research and advertisement tracking. Brand equity {{is a measure of the}} strength of a consumer’s attachment to a brand (Feldwick 37) and includes measures of brand awareness, perceived quality and other consumer associations with the brand (Aaker 27). In the context of honors, brand awareness is an important <b>marketing</b> <b>measure.</b> We can ask students to recall the program name if prompted (“What programs for academically gifted students exist at York?”), and we can ask them to recognize the program name from a list (“Which program, from this list, requires a thesis for graduation?”). Measuring associations to an honors brand is another element of brand equity. A list can be developed of suspected selling points of the program (“classes with only other honor students”) and also a list of fears concerning student beliefs (“only nerds are in the program”). Students can then be asked to select all statements which they feel are advantages of the program and to select all statements which they feel are disadvantages of the program. Honors brand quality can be measured by statements regarding the benefits of the brand (“The honors program improves the image of the college to the public” and “The honors program encouraged higher academic standards for the entire college”) and by asking students to respond to Likert response scales (one-to-seven-point numerical scales). While brand equity methods generally examine pre-existing attitudes about a brand, ad tracking research determines the effectiveness of advertising by examining the consumer’s response to advertising (McDonald 119). Useful ways of measuring consumers’ responses vary and include recognition of advertising (McDonald 120), recall of advertising, awareness of brand, perceptions of brand, attitude toward brand, and reported consumer behavior (Feldwick 114). In the context of honors, ad tracking can be measured by asking students how often they heard their instructors talking about the program or whether they remember an honors student coming to their class to speak about the program. Another way to measure student awareness would be to question students about the content of advertisement messages. For example, students can be given a list of statements about the program (“Honors students take special classes just for honors students”) and asked how confident they are that the statement is true. These marketing research techniques can be applied to the publicity work of any honors program but are especially useful for those that must rely on self-generated advertising...|$|E

40|$|Tēmas aktualitāte saistīta ar valsts pārvaldes modernizāciju un e-pārvaldes t. sk. e-pakalpojumu ieviešanu. Lai izveidotu e-pakalpojumu, būtiski ir izprast pakalpojumu jēdzienu publiskajā pārvaldē, lai tā sniegšanu uzlabotu, izmantojot informācijas tehnoloģijas. Taču jautājums par pakalpojumu publiskajā pārvaldē ir daudz dziļāks nekā tikai konkrētas funkcijas optimizācija. Pakalpojumu jēdzienu publiskajā pārvaldē sāk izmantot kā atbildi sabiedrības spiedienam padarīt pārvaldi efektīvāku, ar to saprotot gan tās darbības skaitlisko rādītāju uzlabošanos, gan ērtību radīšanu indivīdiem, kuri vienlaikus ir valsts pārvaldes klienti. Pakalpojumus valsts pārvaldē var definēt dažādi atkarībā no izvirzītajiem uzdevumiem un pakalpojuma saņēmēja individualizācijas pakāpes. Dažādu autoru publikācijās un arī politikas plānošanas dokumentos nav dota viennozīmīga publiskā pakalpojuma definīcija, un funkciju loks, ko šis termins aptver, var būt visai daudzveidīgs, tāpēc katrā konkrētā dokumentā jāpievērš uzmanība pakalpojumu jēdziena apjomam, kas var svārstīties plašās robežās. Lai pētītu pakalpojuma jēdziena izpratni Latvijā, darba pētnieciskajā daļā analizēti Latvijas un Eiropas Savienības politikas plānošanas dokumenti, kā arī tiesību akti, kuri tiešā veidā ietekmē pakalpojuma jēdziena izpratni Latvijas publiskajā pārvaldē. Darba sākumā izvirzītā hipotēze par to, ka publiskās pārvaldes pakalpojumi ir veids, kā pierādīt sabiedrībai publiskās pārvaldes lietderīgumu un darba efektivitāti un, līdz ar to vairot sabiedrības uzticēšanos gan izpildu, gan lēmējvarai tiek apstiprināta daļēji, jo pakalpojumu definēšana pati par sevi iedzīvotāju viedokli par publisko pārvaldi neuzlabos. Tomēr – pakalpojums ir iestādes funkcijas rezultāts un ja tas ir definēts, tad to ir parādīt sabiedrībai un to var izmantot par kritēriju dažādu reformu efektivitātes mērīšanai. Latvijas prakses analīze pierāda, ka e-pārvaldes efektīva ieviešana nav iespējama bez pašas pārvaldes. E-pakalpojumi, bez paša publiskās pārvaldes pakalpojuma arī ir problemātiski, jo informācijas tehnoloģijas nodrošina piegādes kanālu, nevis pašas sniedz pakalpojumu. Kanāls viens pats bez pakalpojuma nekādus uzlabojumus ne pārvaldei, ne klientam nedos. The {{importance}} of this topic in the latest years is concerned with implementation of e-governance solutions in the public administration, including also development of e-services. In order to develop e-service {{it is necessary to}} understand meaning of service in the public administration. The main question about substance and role of the service in public administration is much complicated as it looks from the viewpoint of the e-governance. The hypothesis advanced for the study is to define public service as a way to explain society what administration does and to demonstrate effectiveness of the reforms and results of the improvements in the public administration. The concept of public service in the public administration started to develop mainly since last two decades of the 20 th century as reply of politicians and administration to the demand coming from society for the more effective governance. Effective governance in this case means request for measurable results and orientation to the market principles. Because in global level improvements in the public administration in the latest years is concerned with implementation of information and communication technologies, also e-governance and e-services are discussed in this study. The main base of empiric part of the study includes analysis of the policy documents and normative acts of European Union and Republic of Latvia. In the level of European Union e-governance and e-services in general are concerned with implementation of Lisbon strategy end following with e-Europe 2002, e-Europe 2005 and 2010 initiatives. Those initiatives and following programmes became the reason for the development of e-services in the national countries. And here concepts of public administration met e-governance. Especially {{it is important for the}} countries following Roman or continental system of law. It is necessary to have clear link between public function and public service as a way for implementation of this function. Analysis provided in this study shows wide borders of usage of the service concept in the public administration. The service and the client in the public administration are not the same as in the private relationships. Difference of those approaches and possibility to define borders of the service concept in the public administration are discussed in this study. Service concept can include <b>marketing</b> <b>measure,</b> quantitative measurement of the effectiveness and efficiency in the public administration and execution of the public functions. In the context of the administrative reform and formation of the Informative society in Latvia it should be mentioned {{importance of}} the legal concepts. Some unclear definitions in the law On State Governance rises unclear understanding of the service concept in public administration and later difficulties to define public services were met. The hypothesis for the public service as a way to explain society mission of the public administration corroborated partially, because there is no straight relation between satisfaction of society and improvement of public services, but service as unit for further measurements and defined process can become an argument. As regards link between public services and e-government, especially for the countries following continental system of law, it is impossible to develop e-service without the main service what is the result of execution of public function. Wide boarders of the public service concept makes necessary to define it in each policy regarding this concept separately, to have clear understanding of the subject...|$|E
