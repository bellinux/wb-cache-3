5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
25|$|Dragonflies and damselflies are common, with 15 species recorded, {{two-thirds of}} which are known to breed here.

5|$|Industrial belts within Greater Dhaka {{is a major}} {{manufacturing}} hub, {{bounded by}} the Buriganga, Meghna, Dhaleshwari, Balu and Turag Rivers. The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous <b>migrant</b> workers. <b>Hawkers,</b> peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ {{a large segment of}} the population â€“ rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013. Dhaka has improved congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.|$|R
50|$|Dhaka is the {{commercial}} heart of Bangladesh. The {{city has a}} large middle class population, increasing the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Many skilled workers are employed in the businesses and industries located in the Dhaka metropolitan area. The city has historically attracted {{a large number of}} <b>migrant</b> workers. <b>Hawkers,</b> peddlers, small shops, rickshaws transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ {{a large segment of the}} population - rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. Even so, unemployment remains high at 23%. According to CityMayors Statistics, Dhaka's GDP registered at $52 billion in 2005 with an annual growth rate of 6.1%. Its estimated GDP in the year 2020 is $126 billion. The annual per capita income of Dhaka is estimated at $550, although a large segment of the population lives below the poverty line, with many surviving on less than $3 a day.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the very}} few lowland heaths in Cheshire, Sound Heath is a {{valuable}} habitat for heathland plants and animals, although its heathland character is currently under threat from the spread of trees and scrub. The common's ponds form {{one of the most important}} sites in the county for freshwater invertebrates. Three nationally rare or endangered species have been found within the area: the mud snail (which is now one of the UK's most endangered freshwater creatures, having been recently recategorised as near threatened across Europe in the new IUCN European Red List of Non-marine Molluscs), great raft spider and the Enochrus isotae species of water scavenger beetle, as well as the nationally scarce beautiful snout moth. The first sightings of the <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker</b> dragonfly in Cheshire were at Sound Heath, and many other locally rare species have been recorded here. The site is also an important breeding site for birds.|$|E
500|$|Southern <b>Migrant</b> <b>Hawker</b> {{was known}} {{from just a}} single record, in Kent in 1952, {{although}} an Aeshna seen in 1992 {{on the outskirts of}} Bristol may have been this species (Holmes 1993 [...] ), and the species has been recorded twice in Jersey since 1998 (Long 2000, Parr 2005 [...] ). However in 2006 four specimens were seen: In the Adur valley in West Sussex on 13 July Grimstone Warren, Norfolk on 21 July; Little Wootton Inclosure New Forest (SZ 227 987) on 6 August; And {{at the mouth of the}} Beaulieu River in Hampshire on 10 August. since 2012 it has probably become established as a breeding species in the Thames Estuary area.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} lakes and three small pools frequented by dragonflies. The emperor dragonfly, <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker,</b> black-tailed skimmer and red-eyed {{damselfly}} are amongst other breeding species. Freshwater molluscs are represented and the site is the only known one in Gloucestershire for the tiny 'pea mussel'.|$|E

5000|$|The Atlas of the Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland {{published}} in 1996 listed just three species; blue-tailed damselfly, common darter (both breeding residents) and the <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker.</b> The pools can be slightly brackish {{at times and}} only species that can tolerate these conditions can establish populations on the islands.|$|E
50|$|Amongst the {{dragonfly}} fauna of {{the site}} are the fenland hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), the black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), the ruddy darter (Symtetrum sanguineum), and the <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna mixta).

50|$|The <b>migrant</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna mixta) {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} species of hawker dragonflies.

A. mixta occurs in North Africa, southern and central Europe to the Baltic region.|$|E
50|$|Koseze Pond is {{now used}} as a {{recreation}} area by local residents. In the summer it is used for racing radio-controlled model boats and fishing. Swimming is prohibited due to the poor quality of the water, which is also contaminated by cyanobacteria. In the winter it is used for skating.

40|$|Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are {{important}} prey for many small falcons, {{and the recent}} expansion of the breeding range of the Hobby into eastern England {{has been associated with}} an increased availability of dragonfly prey to juveniles. We have therefore measured the energy content and elemental composition of a range of common British dragonflies. Carbon and nitrogen contents were typical of aquatic invertebrates and did not vary with dragonfly size, whereas ash content was significantly reduced in larger species. The mean energy content of dragonfly tissue was 24. 6 kJ/g (dry mass) and showed no significant variation between species. The energy content of an individual dragonfly ranged from 0. 8 to 9. 4 kJ for the species examined in this study. Data on the energy requirements of free-living falcons suggest that a juvenile Hobby in late summer could meet its daily energy requirement by capturing between 75 and 90 <b>Migrant</b> <b>Hawker</b> or 200 to 250 Common Darter dragonflies each day...|$|E
