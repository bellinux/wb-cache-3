40|$|Membrane {{potentials}} (Vm) and intracellular calcium variations {{were studied}} in Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) leaves when the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>cutworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) was attacking the plants. In {{addition to the}} effect of the feeding insect the impact of several N-acyl Glns (volicitin, N-palmitoyl-Gln, N-linolenoyl-Gln) from the larval oral secretion was studied. The results showed that the early events upon herbivore attack were: a) a strong Vm depolarization at the bite zone and an isotropic wave of Vm depolarization spreading throughout the entire attacked leaf; b) a Vm depolarization observed for the regurgitant but not with volicitin {N-(17 -hydroxy-linolenoyl) -Gln} alone; c) an enhanced influx of Ca 2 + at {{the very edge of the}} bite, which is halved, if the Ca 2 + channel blocker Verapamil is used. Furthermore, the dose-dependence effects of N-acyl Gln conjugates-triggered influx of Ca 2 + studied in transgenic aequorin-expressing soybean (Glycine max) cells, showed: a) a concentration-dependent influx of Ca 2 +; b) a configuration-independent effect concerning the stereochemistry of the amino acid moiety; c) a slightly reduced influx of Ca 2 + after modification of the fatty acid backbone by functionalization with oxygen and; d) a comparable effect with the detergent SDS. Finally, the herbivore wounding causes a response in the plant cells that cannot be mimicked by mechanical wounding. The involvement of Ca 2 + in signaling after herbivore wounding is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: In {{the month}} of April 1431, Messer Pietro Querini, of Venice, set sail from Candia, in Crete, destined for Flanders, with 68 companions and associates. After {{crossing}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> and <b>climbing</b> up the Atlantic, the ship is carried away by a storm. The frightful history of the Venetian sailors in the cold seas began. In April 1431, the nave Querina, a Venetian ship, left Crete for Flanders, with sixty-eight men on board. The journey lasted ten months. Eighteen months later, only eleven frightened survivors return to Venice. From their appalling shipwreck {{on the outskirts of}} the Arctic Circle, we have two complementary and divergent testimonies, one by Pietro Querini, owner and captain of the ship, and the other by Cristoforo Fioravante and Nicolò de Michiel. They all recounted how, driven by incessant storms in the Atlantic, after weeks of drifting on a disintegrating nave that had to be abandoned for frail boats, they finally failed, in the heart of the boreal winter, on a deserted island of The Lofoten Archipelago, in the north of Norway. In these accounts of survivors we are revealed with a rare force the universal fear of the engulfment in the abyss...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean {{region is}} {{characterized}} by high precipitation variability often enhanced by orography, with strong seasonality and large inter-annual fluctuations, and by high heterogeneity of terrain and land surface properties. As a consequence, catchments {{in this area are}} often prone to the occurrence of hydrometeorological extremes, including storms, floods and flash-floods. A number of climate studies focused in the Mediterranean region predict that extreme events will occur with higher intensity and frequency, thus requiring further analyses to assess their effect at the land surface, particularly in small- and medium-sized watersheds. In this study, climate and hydrologic simulations produced within the Climate Induced Changes on the Hydrology of <b>Mediterranean</b> Basins (<b>CLIMB)</b> EU FP 7 research project were used to analyze how precipitation extremes propagate into discharge extremes in the Rio Mannu basin (472. 5 km 2), located in Sardinia, Italy. The basin hydrologic response to climate forcings in a reference (1971 - 2000) and a future (2041 - 2070) period was simulated through the combined use of a set of global and regional climate models, statistical downscaling techniques, and a process based distributed hydrologic model. We analyzed and compared the distribution of annual maxima extracted from hourly and daily precipitation and peak discharge time series, simulated by the hydrologic model under climate forcing. For this aim, yearly maxima were fit by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution using a regional approach. Next, we discussed commonality and contrasting behaviors of precipitation and discharge maxima distributions to better understand how hydrological transformations impact propagation of extremes. Finally, we show how rainfall statistical downscaling algorithms produce more reliable forcings for hydrological models than coarse climate model outputs...|$|R
40|$|The Climate Induced Changes on the Hydrology of <b>Mediterranean</b> Basins (<b>CLIMB)</b> Project is a multi-institutional {{research}} project, {{funded by}} 7 th EU Framework Programme, {{which has the}} main goal of reducing uncertainties in the quantification of climate change impact in Mediterranean basins. Current studies including IPCC indicate, in fact, that the water budget in these areas will be very likely affected by climate change, with severe impacts on agricultural productivity and drinking water supply. One of the CLIMB study sites is the Rio Mannu at Monastir, a $ 470 Km^ 2 $ catchment located in an agricultural area in southern Sardinia (Italy) with gently rolling topography. In this study, we show preliminary results on the sensitivity of hydrological response in this basin under climatic changes conditions. For this aim, outputs of several climate models are used to force the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS), a fully distributed, physically based model able to continuously simulate hydrological processes occurring in a basin, by explicitly taking into account variability of meteorological forcing and basin properties. We first present results of the calibration effort, based on a relatively limited dataset consisting of: (i) hydrometeorological data available over 26 years in the period 1925 - 1964 and including daily rain gage observations, daily streamflow data at the outlet and temperature observations from four stations, (ii) a 10 -m Digital Elevation Model, (iii) a digitized soil texture map, (iv) the CORINE land cover map. Once calibrated, we use tRIBS to simulate the hydrological response in the Rio Mannu basin, under a number of climate change scenarios, generated by several numerical climate models collected by the PRUDENCE project of the FP 5, the ENSEMBLES project of the FP 6 and the US project PCMDI/CMIP 3. Finally, we present and discuss preliminary comparisons {{and analysis of the}} hydrological impacts of the different climatic scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean basin {{is one of}} {{the areas}} of the world where climate changes due to global warming are {{expected}} to be more significant. Future scenarios predicted by global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs) indicate a decrease in water availability, which will lead to social and economic consequences, mainly affecting the agricultural sector. Reducing the uncertainty in the quantification of the climate changes impacts in Mediterranean watersheds is the main goal of the Climate Induced Changes on the Hydrology of <b>Mediterranean</b> Basins (<b>CLIMB)</b> project, funded by the 7 th EU Framework Programme. One of the study sites of CLIMB is the Rio Mannu at Monastir (473 km 2) basin, located in an agricultural area of Southern Sardinia, Italy, that has experienced severe drought periods during the last 30 years with dramatic decreases of crop productivity. To quantify the climate change impacts, outputs of four RCMs are used to force a distributed and physically-based hydrologic model, known as TIN-based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS). In this study, we first illustrate the tRIBS model calibration, using the limited dataset available in the Rio Mannu basin, a common feature in most regions of the world. In our study site, hydrometeorological data (streamflow, precipitation, temperature and meteorological variables) are available at different resolution and during non-overlapping periods. To create the database at hourly resolution required for tRIBS application, we designed two downscaling strategies, aimed at (i) disaggregating precipitation from daily to hourly resolution using a multifractal model, and (ii) obtaining reference evapotranspiration at hourly time scale from daily records of minimum and maximum temperature. We demonstrate how the downscaling tools are able to generate a reliable database to calibrate the hydrologic model, and how they can be used to disaggregate coarse outputs of climate models. In a second part of the study, the downscaled outputs of the RCMs are used to force the calibrated hydrologic model for the future (from 2041 to 2070) and reference (from 1971 to 2000) periods. The impacts on water budget and availability in the Rio Mannu basin under the future climatic scenarios is quantified through several techniques and metrics computed from the time series and the spatial maps of the hydrologic variables simulated in the two periods...|$|R
