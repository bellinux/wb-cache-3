Uboat.net reports that UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Hittite {{accounts}} {{about the}} campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> {{there was a}} possible Mycenaean empire centered on late Bronze Age Greece. Moreover, Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name Atreus, a king of Mycenae according to Greek mythology.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} activity {{occurred in the}} region farther east, on Hardy Peninsula and some surrounding capes and islands during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 18 and 21 million years ago. These volcanic systems <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Antarctic Plate is subducting beneath the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|The border {{position}} of Transylvania {{led to the}} formation of the voivodeship, since the monarchs could not maintain direct control over this remote region. Thus the voivodes were never autonomous, but remained provincial officials. The voivodes were heads of Fehér County from 1201, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> their position had its origin in the office of that county's ispán.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{found out}} that when {{pressures}} {{were added to the}} brakes, then there would be an increase in drag force and temperature on the assembly. Examination on the brake assembly of Flight 420 revealed that at the time, the brake assembly's temperature were exposed to a temperature of more than 600 degree Celsius, which <b>may</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> there was a significant amount of drag force {{at the time of the}} crash.|$|R

5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|These peculiarities <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the artisan who {{designed}} the inscription was unfamiliar with runic writing, although {{perhaps some of the}} unusual letterforms may have been errors occasioned by the difficulty of inlaying wire to form runes.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> his {{feelings}} for Josephine were more serious {{at the time}} than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E

5|$|Farm {{animals such as}} {{cows and}} horses as well as pet animals are also {{susceptible}} {{to the effects of}} lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 May the Conservatives {{promised to}} replace the 1983 Mental Health Act, to employ an {{additional}} 10,000 NHS mental health workers by 2020 and to tackle discrimination against those with mental health problems. <b>May</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the Conservatives would maintain their net immigration target, and promised to implement a cap on [...] "rip-off energy prices", a policy that appeared in Labour's 2015 manifesto. <b>May</b> <b>indicated</b> she would permit a free vote among Conservative MPs on repealing the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales.

5|$|Rudolf Simek {{states that}} the obscurity {{of the names of}} the objects in the tale of Hjúki and Bil <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Snorri derived them from a folktale, and that the form of the tale of the Man in the Moon (featuring a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel) is also found in modern {{folklore}} in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Venusian {{surface was}} {{a subject of}} {{speculation}} until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> {{there have been some}} recent eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> OFC {{is the result}} of parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E
30|$|We have {{compared}} the selected clinical data of patients practicing combat sports with matched controls – patients declaring physical activity {{of less than}} hour a day with exclusion of combat sports. There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups, which <b>may</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> practicing combat sports itself may not lead to the deterioration of glycemic control. One should, however, underline, that our study was of retrospective and observational nature, thus drawing definite conclusions concerning the effects of combat sport on glycemic control should wait until prospective, randomized studies are performed.|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, {{and they probably}} had a variety of functions. As well as burials, indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas {{to the east and}} west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> activity at the enclosure met a violent end.|$|E
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
