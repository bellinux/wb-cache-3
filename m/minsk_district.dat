40|$|Rural {{areas in}} Poland are {{distinguished}} {{by one of}} the worst spatial structures of individual land properties in the European Union. The least favourable structure occurs in the southern and south-eastern part of the country, where it results in farms losing 20 - 30 % of their agricultural revenue. The bad spatial organisation of land is also reflected in transaction prices obtained for agricultural land. Considering criteria such as: land management, parcel area, width, and elongation (length to width ratio), and soil bonitation value, this paper determines the effect of each of the criteria separately on the development of transaction prices of agricultural land in the years 2009 - 2014 in selected villages {{in the southern part of}} the Cegłów (<b>Mińsk</b> <b>district,</b> Mazowieckie province), distinguished by the unfavourable spatial structure of agricultural land. Meeting this objective involved the application of the analytical capacity of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cadastral data base, soil-agricultural map vector, study of the conditions and directions of the spatial management of the Cegłów area, and the property price and value register. The obtained study results suggest that in areas with particularly defective spatial structure, land with parameters permitting its efficient use, i. e. with proper width and elongation is particularly valuable. Another parameter determining the level of obtained prices is the bonitation value, although it is of less importance for the analysed area than for agricultural areas with proper management conditions...|$|E

In 1924 the government created a committee - Belkomzet - to allocate land to Jewish families, in 1926 a total of 32,700 hectares were given for 6,860 Jewish families. Jews would continue to play a major role in Byelorussian politics, society and economy right up to the Second World War, in fact between 1928 and 1930 the First secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, was Yakov Gamarnik, a Jew.|$|R

40|$|Radon is {{the major}} {{contributor}} to the background exposure of the population. In the world practice, the radon risk or radon potential mapping are used for the radon dose assessment. The aim of this work was a radon danger mapping of the Republic of Belarus to assess the radiation situation and determine the radon hazard critical areas. Materials and methods: The mapping is based on measured values of radon volume activity in the living rooms of different buildings on {{the territory of the}} six regions of the Republic of Belarus. We have performed more than 4000 measurements. Integral track radon radiometers based on the polymer Kodak LR- 115 film were used to evaluate radon volume activity. Exposure time ranged from 90 to 120 days. The cartogram was built with using the MAPINFO software package. Results: The low levels of radon concentrations were determined in the Brest and Gomel regions, {{as well as in the}} southern <b>districts</b> of <b>Minsk</b> and south-western <b>districts</b> of the Mogilev region. The high levels radon concentrations were determined in some districts of the Vitebsk and Grodno regions, as well as in the north-eastern districts of the Mogilev region. About 2 – 5 times nonuniformity of radon distribution in settlements of the Republic was observed. The radon hazard critical areas with radon concentrations in the range of 200 – 400 Bq/m 3 were found in some districts of the Vitebsk, Grodno and Mogilev regions. Conclusions: The radon risk map of the Republic of Belarus gives the possibility to estimate the existing radiation risk. Taking into account the low efficiency of countermeasures long after the Chernobyl accident, it is necessary to increase the level of radiation protection through the radon mitigation activities or to change the radon normative documents. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuity}} of different internships at Belarussian State University, Geographical department, Geoecological specialisation is observed in the article.  The students do field training (topographical, meteorological, geomorphological, hydrological, etc.) during the 1 st and 2 nd years at the geographical station «Zapadnaya Berezina» in Volozhinsk <b>district,</b> <b>Minsk</b> region. They examine not only separate natural constituents, but also natural complexes. During the landscape-ecological field training the students estimate human impact and relative stability of the landscape {{on the natural}} boundary. Environmental technologic training is various: students master and independently apply the techniques of complex geoecological research of local natural economic geosystems, study geoecological basis of technological processes of manufacturing, determine important ecological aspects of enterprise activities.  Pollutant emission into the open air {{is one of the}} most important ecological aspects. Students take into account a danger factor of an enterprise, examine emission sources and analyze their temporary variations. When students analyze sewage, they pay attention to substance release, its physicochemical composition and sewage works. Students also deal with different kinds of waste products and their volume, their recycling. Air, water, waste, etc. statistic report forms are given to the students for defining the impact of enterprises on the environment.  The importance of school practice is underlined in the article. Moreover, the graduates of the department work at schools, lyceums, colleges, universities. Externship is also discussed in the article as it is aimed at creation of professional competence. The students do an internship in the committees and inspections of the Ministry of natural resources and environment protection, national parks and wildlife reserves, scientific research laboratories of «Landscape ecology», «Limnology», Institute of natural resources management, etc.  at Belarusian State University.  The variation of internships is discussed in the article. It is dedicated to the geoecological evaluation of some natural resources (aquatic, land, etc.) and the state of environment in some administrative districts and physiographic regions, the quality of urban environment, and also to the geoecological estimation of tourism development within different administrative units.  Conclusion. Thus, a well-represented {{continuity of}} different internships at Geographical department of Belarusian State University is an important element of highly-qualified specialist training in the field of the environment and rational management of natural resources.  Different types of trainings help to form academic and professional competence of future specialists...|$|R
