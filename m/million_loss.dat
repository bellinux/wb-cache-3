5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1987 and became a public company in 1999. It {{expanded}} its MIS business rapidly in the 2000s, supported by favourable tax regulations for these types of investments. Most of the Group's business was in plantation forestry to supply woodchips for the pulp and paper industry, but in the 2000s it diversified into high-value timbers, beef cattle, olives, viticulture, and almond production. The company's after-tax profit peaked at A$132 million in 2006, but by 2008 had deteriorated to a A$63 <b>million</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 <b>million</b> <b>loss</b> in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
5|$|The company {{reported}} a A$64 <b>million</b> <b>loss</b> in its 2008 financial year. By 2009, {{the global economic}} downturn, and regulatory uncertainty associated with MIS schemes, was putting the company under financial pressure, and it was seeking to improve its situation both through asset sales and refinancing of debt. Its debt levels had risen significantly: it had extended its debt financing with its banks from A$245million to A$350million in 2007. By September 2008 its total debt had ballooned to A$820million, of which A$376million was owed to its lead bankers, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, BankWest and Mizuho. Great Southern had also been hoping to see {{a rise in the}} price obtained for its woodchips, but was unsuccessful in its 2009 negotiations with Japanese customers.|$|E

50|$|Losses {{began to}} mount in 2008, when the 15-store chain had $125.4 {{million in sales}} {{and a loss of}} $234,154.

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 <b>million</b> <b>loss</b> as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland moved a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 <b>million</b> <b>loss</b> that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
