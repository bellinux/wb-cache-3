The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything.

40|$|I can wholeheartedly {{say that}} {{committing}} to this research project {{is one of}} the best decisions I have made to date. The determination it takes to commit to research is beyond comparison. Even the slightest possibility that I could contribute to the scientific realm of discoveries has kept my curiosity stimulated throughout the interval of my project. Research, at times, can be frustrating and failures are inevitable but making expected or unexpected discoveries alleviates all frustrations. I have learned a vast amount of knowledge from my research, and it has positively contributed to my character in so many ways. There are many people that have directly and indirectly contributed to my research. First, and foremost, I would like to thank my professor and mentor Dr. Mary Clancy for her excellent guidance. This project would not have been possible without her leadership and dedication. Dr. Clancy is the first professor I came to know during <b>my</b> <b>freshmen</b> <b>year</b> of college. Her passion for science and research has inspired me to pursue a degree in biology and sparked my interest in research. Her boundless intelligence, brilliant professorship, and down-to- earth personality made it a pleasure to work with her. I am honored she gave me the opportunity to work with her my sophomore year in college, and she has significantly helped me to flourish as...|$|R

6000|$|I {{completed}} {{the first half}} of <b>my</b> <b>freshman</b> <b>year,</b> and in January of 1897 took up my courses for the second half. But the pressure from lack of money, plus a conviction that the university was not giving me all that I wanted in the time I could spare for it, forced me to leave. I was not very disappointed. For two years I had studied, and in those two years, what was far more valuable, I had done a prodigious amount of reading. Then, too, my grammar had improved. It is true, I had not yet learned that I must say [...] "It is I"; but I no longer was guilty of a double negative in writing, though still prone to that error in excited speech.|$|E
6000|$|In my nineteenth year I {{returned}} to Oakland and {{started at the}} High School, which ran the usual school magazine. This publication was a weekly--no, I guess a monthly--one, and I wrote stories for it, very little imaginary, just recitals of my sea and tramping experiences. I remained there a year, doing janitor work {{as a means of}} livelihood, and leaving eventually because the strain was more than I could bear. At this time my socialistic utterances had attracted considerable attention, and I was known as the [...] "Boy Socialist," [...] a distinction that brought about my arrest for street-talking. After leaving the High School, in three months cramming by myself, I took the three years' work for that time and entered the University of California. I hated to give up the hope of a University education and worked in a laundry and with my pen to help me keep on. This was the only time I worked because I loved it, but the task was too much, and when half-way through <b>my</b> <b>Freshman</b> <b>year</b> I had to quit.|$|E

Why, I should keep a temperance house, here, of course; you can't do anything else in these days. If I was left to choose between hotel-keeping and any other life that I know of, I'd choose it every time," [...] Jeff went on, {{after a moment of}} silence. [...] "I like a hotel. You can be your own man from the start; the start's made here, and I've helped to make it. All you've got to do is to have common-sense in the hotel business, and you're sure to succeed. I believe I've got common-sense, and I believe I've got some ideas that I can work up into a great success. The reason that most people fail in the hotel business is that they waste so much, and the landlord that wastes on his guests can't treat them well. It's got so now that in the big city houses they can't make anything on feeding people, and so they try to make it up on the rooms. I should feed them well--I believe I know how--and I should make money on my table, as they do in Europe.|$|E

" This was a freshman-only seminar oriented towards introducing how different fields ask questions and solve problems. From the course description: "In this seminar, we explore the histories, sciences, and technologies of reading. Guest lectures and visits to libraries and labs introduce different disciplinary approaches, as we ask: How did people read in the past? How do novelists, poets, and book artists conceptualize the act of reading? What happens in the brain when we read? And how do machines read differently from humans? Our investigations culminate in a multimodal exhibit, produced collaboratively. ...|$|R

REAP is a summer award program of the Hamel Center for Undergraduate Research at UNH for highly motivated freshman after their first year. They carry out a research project under the supervision of a UNH faculty member. Professor Dorsey was working on a book-length project on perceptions of chemical warfare in Britain, the United States, and Canada during the interwar and World War II periods. I was to research Canadian and American sources from these periods in the popular press and literature, political speeches, and scientific literature {{having to do with the}} use of poison gas in wartime. The purpose of my and Professor Dorsey’s research was to see if public, political, and scientific perceptions of poison gas could have influenced or replaced legal means taken to control its use after World War I; and if so, how. This project also gave me the opportunity to learn how to conduct scholarly research in primary and secondary sources...|$|R

50|$|The {{application}} of Purpose-Guided Education {{to the college}} student success discussion reflects a general theme among recent best-sellers and trends.A battery of popular books reflects this idea of “beginning with the end in mind,” as Steven Covey champions in his Seven Habits for Highly Successful People. An increasing number of teachers and professors are shoving aside mainstay “student success” curriculum and making room for this Coveyistic genre. Themes throughout the texts of popular writers like John Maxwell, “Dr. Phil” and Parker Palmer imbibe this notion of “alignment,” or “merging” a person’s core with an articulated life purpose. Likewise, Alfie Kohn’s provocative best-seller, Punished by Rewards, candidly chastises educators for focusing on external issues and incentives instead of intrinsic concerns. Denise Clark Pope’s Doing School likewise challenges the current educational steps to academic “success”, a notion also implied in <b>My</b> <b>Freshman</b> <b>Year.</b>|$|E

5000|$|If {{communities}} are developed based on something they share in common, whether that be location or values, then one challenge for developing communities {{is how to}} incorporate individuality and differences. Indeed, as Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, <b>My</b> <b>Freshman</b> <b>Year,</b> we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. Nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere: [...] "What holds students together, really, is age, pop culture, a handful of (recent) historical events, and getting a degree" [...] (qtd. In Barrios 229). Universities may try to create community through all freshman reads, freshman seminars, and school pride; however, Nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes, such as age and pop culture, that they bring with them to college. Nathan's point, then, is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance, which can prevent the development of your social community. (Barrios, Barclay.
