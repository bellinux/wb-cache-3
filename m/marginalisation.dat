5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{propagated}} {{the principles}} of rationalism, self-respect, women’s rights and eradication of caste. He opposed the exploitation and <b>marginalisation</b> of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition of what he considered Indo-Aryan India.|$|E
5|$|The New Age {{has also}} been {{identified}} by various scholars of religion {{as part of the}} cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared <b>marginalisation</b> within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.|$|E
5|$|Though {{inspired}} by French socialist and sociological thought, Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to <b>marginalisation</b> and poverty {{and that only}} a large-scale change in the economic system can bring about real change.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further <b>marginalisation</b> of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} <b>marginalisation</b> of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw {{the rise}} of regionalist {{politics}} in Bombay, {{with the formation of}} the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative <b>marginalisation</b> of the native Marathi people in Bombay. Shiv Sena switched from 'Marathi Cause' to larger 'Hindutva Cause' in 1985 and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in same year. The Congress had dominated the politics of Bombay from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Bombay Municipal Corporation elections.|$|E
5|$|Most Germans were {{relieved}} that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without {{the constraints of the}} Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of the}} war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive <b>marginalisation</b> of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E
5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing <b>marginalisation</b> in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
5|$|Tulu {{is spoken}} {{mainly in the}} coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. Tulu Mahabharato, written by Arunabja in the Tigalari script, is the oldest {{surviving}} Tulu text. Tigalari script was used by Brahmins to write Sanskrit language. The use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in Tigalari script contributed to the <b>marginalisation</b> of Tigalari script. Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada districts and in parts of Udupi, Konkani use the Devanagari script for writing. The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district, speak Kodava Takk. Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern Mendale Takka and the southern Kiggaati Takka. Kodava Takk use the Kannada script for writing. English is the medium of education in many schools and widely used for business communication in most private companies.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} <b>marginalisation</b> of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} this policy of the NEP has also contributed to a brain drain. Others suggest that the NEP has contributed to racial {{polarisation}} {{and a feeling of}} <b>marginalisation</b> among the non-Malays.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} a trend among Marathi {{speaking}} parents of all social classes in major urban areas of sending their children to English medium schools. There is some concern, though without foundation, that this may lead to <b>marginalisation</b> of the language.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a Tamil who {{was highly}} {{respected}} by foreign diplomats {{and who had}} been sharply critical of the LTTE, was assassinated at his home on August 12, 2005, allegedly by an LTTE sniper. His assassination led to the <b>marginalisation</b> of the LTTE from the international community.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the post-war}} decades were {{characterized}} by social strife and widespread <b>marginalisation</b> of the left in political and social spheres, Greece nonetheless experienced rapid economic growth and recovery, propelled {{in part by the}} U.S.-administered Marshall Plan. In 1952, Greece joined NATO, reinforcing its membership in the Western Bloc of the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Belu Zilber {{claimed that}} having himself {{been subject to}} {{suspicion}} and <b>marginalisation,</b> he had attempted to warn Pătrășcanu {{of the change in}} climate, and had asked him to consider fleeing the Eastern Bloc, only to be stiffly rebuffed. Zilber was eventually arrested in February 1948, on suspicion that he had been a Siguranța Statului agent infiltrating the party.|$|E
25|$|Ruhama (Hebrew: Renewed life), {{established}} in 1989, is a Dublin-based NGO which {{works on a}} national level with women affected by prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation. The organisation regards prostitution as violence against women and violations of women's human rights. Ruhama sees prostitution and the social and cultural attitudes which sustain it as being deeply rooted in gender inequality and social <b>marginalisation.</b> Ruhama offers a range of services to support women in and exiting prostitution. Ruhama also seeks to highlight sex trafficking.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{unsuccessful}} examples of guerrilla warfare against local or native regimes. These include Portuguese Africa (Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau), Malaysia (then Malaya) during the Malayan Emergency, Bolivia, Argentina, and the Philippines. It was {{even able to}} use these tactics effectively against the Indian Peace Keeping Force sent by India in the mid-1980s, which were later withdrawn for varied reasons, primarily political. The Tigers are fighting to create a separate homeland for Sri Lankan Tamils, many of whom complain of <b>marginalisation</b> by successive governments led by the Sinhalese majority since independence from Britain in 1948.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, oil {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the region, by 1966 Gulf Oil Company began commercial exploitation. The large amounts of revenue generated by oil royalties, contributed {{to the rise of}} Cabinda's geopolitical significance. By 1970 oil revenues amounted to 16 million $, and were expected to rise to 32–50 million $ by 1972. Oil continued to play an important role, by 2011 it represented approximately 86% of the Angolan state’s total earnings. The <b>marginalisation</b> of the local population in favor of Portuguese and later Angolan interests {{played an important role in}} the rise of separatist militancy in the region.|$|E
25|$|Economic factors {{played a}} major role in the {{outbreak}} of the Arab revolt. Palestine's fellahin, the country's peasant farmers, comprised over two-thirds of the indigenous Arab population and from the 1920s onwards they were pushed off the land in increasingly large numbers into urban environments where they often encountered only poverty and social <b>marginalisation.</b> Many were crowded into shanty towns in Jaffa and Haifa where they found succor and encouragement in the teachings of the charismatic preacher Izz ad-Din al-Qassam who worked among the poor in Haifa. The revolt was thus a popular uprising that produced its own leaders and developed into a national revolt.|$|E
25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of <b>marginalisation</b> to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E
25|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants; {{they were}} all provided by the government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and sold much of it to speculators who later resold it to farmers. The French language and Catholic religion faced increasing <b>marginalisation</b> in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the emerging controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status as Indians with a right to land).|$|E
25|$|After the {{economic}} crisis of 1929 Indos {{were the first to}} truly comprehend the profound change initiated by the so-called ‘Dutch Ethical Policy’ (1900–1930). The relatively limited but high quality educational opportunities that had been opened to indigenous peoples had produced a large and growing number of Western style educated indigenous people competing on the job market. Jobs that were traditionally occupied by Indos were more and more taken over by indigenous people. As Indos numbered only 0.3 percent of the 60 million native people inhabiting the Dutch East Indies they came under increasing threat of <b>marginalisation.</b> At the same time the educated indigenous elite was also developing an Indonesian nationalist political agenda.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{throughout}} Europe {{have identified}} risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation {{that are also}} causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic <b>marginalisation,</b> dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children’s rights to a safe and healthy development.|$|E
25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio {{thought that this was}} something that required skill—almost {{as if it were a}} reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the <b>marginalisation</b> of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E
25|$|Portadown is a {{predominantly}} Protestant town. The small area surrounding the Garvaghy Road {{is a small}} Catholic community within Portadown. That community has long been subjected to sectarian discrimination, <b>marginalisation,</b> and abuse. The Orange Order insist it is their right as citizens to march down the Garvaghy Road, a route they claim to hold traditional and communal value. The residents of Garvaghy Road insist it is their right not {{to be subjected to}} marches perceived by many as sectarian and intimidating. The stand-off between the Orangemen and the RUC Royal Ulster Constabulary, which previously colluded in facilitating the Orange demonstrations of strength, has become symbolic of the intractable sectarian divide that poisons relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland. And a local anthropologist, Peter Mulholland, has argued that Orange parades effectively deny the human rights and dignity of the minority community through annually reviving and fanning the flames of sectarian hatred.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 however, High Commissioner John Anderson {{expressed}} concerns over over-centralisation, which was <b>marginalisation</b> local sultans away from policymaking. This {{led to the}} creation of Federal Council, which the sultans were members along with representatives from the colonial government and members of the non-Malay communities. The creation of the council however failed to distribute powers to the individuals FMS states. Another attempt at decentralisation as carried out in 1925 by Laurence Guillemard, the High Commissioner from 1920 to 1927, which was termed as the Decentralisation Debate of 1925-1927. While the Malays supported the proposal because it would give them more powers, Chinese merchants and British planters argued against it, fearing decentralisation would affect efficiency badly and slow effort at building a unified modern state. The next High Commissioner, Cecil Clementi, arriving from Hong Kong in 1930, pushed harder for decentralisation, believing that it would entice the UMS to join the FMS, forming a Malayan union. He envisaged the union would eventually be joined by the Straits Settlements as well as the British Borneo.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 30 September 1965 an {{attempted}} coup took place in Jakarta. Six senior Indonesian military leaders were killed, while General Nasution narrowly escaped from his would be captors. In the ensuing confusion Sukarno agreed to allow Suharto to assume emergency command and control of Jakarta and the armed forces stationed there. Blame for the failed coup was attributed to the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and in the following weeks and months a campaign of imprisonment and lynching of PKI members and sympathisers broke out across Jakarta and Indonesia. With Suharto's grip on power in Jakarta and Indonesia delicately poised, the scale and intensity of Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo began to ease. The train of events set off by the failed coup led to Suharto's gradual consolidation of power and <b>marginalisation</b> of Sukarno. At the same time, the anti-communist purge spread throughout Indonesia. Suharto's steady consolidation of power after 30 September events allowed him {{to form a new}} government and in March 1967 Suharto was able to form a new Cabinet that excluded Sukarno.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Commission had firmly {{rejected}} the principles {{on which the}} National Party's official policy of apartheid was based, and therefore raised its ire. Hendrik Verwoerd, then an MP {{and the editor of}} Die Transvaler, was especially critical. And a declaration signed by a prominent group of Stellenbosch academics angrily pointed out that if Fagan's racial integration were allowed this would lead inevitably to gelykstelling (social levelling) and, as a result of pressure to give blacks equal civil rights, the political <b>marginalisation</b> of the white population; the upshot would be the death of the Afrikaner volk. Though they were angry, the Nationalists had not been caught unprepared: in fact, Malan had already set up a rival commission headed by his closest confidante, Paul Sauer, and staffed by three NP parliamentarians, and which had reported in 1947. The Sauer Commission had given added detail and heft to the Nationalists' policy of apartheid, recommending that influx control measures be strengthened to prevent any mixing between the races, with black people consigned to the reserves. It was this hard-line view which triumphed when Malan's National Party won the 1948 general election.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} nature of Irish society following the 1801 Act of Union saw a redefining {{of the status of}} women, with an idealisation of nuns at one extreme and a <b>marginalisation</b> of prostitutes at the other. Yet it was estimated that there were 17,000 women working as prostitutes in Dublin alone, and a further 8 brothels in Cork. Dublin's sex trade was largely centred on the Monto district, reputedly the largest red light district in Europe. A major part of the demand came from the large number of British army military personnel stationed in Ireland at the time. The ‘Wrens of the Curragh’, for instance were a group of some sixty women working as ‘army camp followers’ around the Curragh. Increasing concern regarding venereal disease, particularly {{as a threat to the}} military led to the introduction of a series of Contagious Diseases Acts in the 1860s, enabling authorities to apprehend and detain any woman suspected of prostitution and force her to submit to examination for disease. As in many other countries opposition to the Acts, provided a rallying cry for emerging women's movements. Anna Haslam in Dublin and Isabella Tod in Belfast, both of the Ladies National Association, organised opposition and a recognition not only of the plight of these women but also of the root causes.|$|E
500|$|Finally, the <b>marginalisation</b> of English {{animals in}} {{competitions}} {{from the late}} 1860s reinforced the case to improve the breed by itself. [...] The French Limousin Herd Book was then created in 1886 {{in order to ensure}} the breed's purity and improvement by recording only those animals that satisfied a strictly enforced breed standard.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting {{the mutual}} climate of {{distrust}} and racialist policies in both Singapore and Malaysia (in Singapore, the policies allegedly being pro-Chinese), Lee Kuan Yew sparked another debate in September {{on the role}} of Malay primacy in Malaysian politics, stating that the Chinese had been [...] "systematically marginalised" [...] in both Malaysia and Indonesia. The resulting diplomatic incident, with ensuing denials of <b>marginalisation</b> from Malaysian government politicians, led to Lee issuing an apology for his remarks which also attempted to justify them. Abdullah indicated he was not satisfied with what he referred to as a [...] "qualified apology", but the Malaysian government accepted it nevertheless.|$|E
500|$|Unavailable {{for several}} months, Bjørnebye {{appeared}} just twice for Liverpool in the 1995–96 season. Recovery and injuries to other left back candidates enabled Bjørnebye to reclaim his place the following season, {{in which he}} scored his first goal for Liverpool on 17 August 1996 in a 3–3 draw against Middlesbrough. He contributed to the club's most convincing title challenge {{since the inception of}} the Premier League by supplying club strikers Stan Collymore and Robbie Fowler with precise crosses. He was ultimately included in the PFA Team of the Year with Steve McManaman and Mark Wright. The acquisition of Steve Staunton and arrival of Gérard Houllier in the 1998–99 season, limited Bjørnebye's first-team opportunities, leading to his effective <b>marginalisation.</b> Bjørnebye affirmed his recurring determination to stay at Liverpool that season, remarking [...] "If I didn't have any fight in my stomach I'd have left Liverpool at least three times before".|$|E
500|$|They {{produced}} {{their first}} eponymously titled album in 1964, which largely consisted of {{rhythm and blues}} standards. Following {{in the wake of}} the Beatles' national and then international success, the Rolling Stones soon established themselves as the second most popular UK band and joined the British Invasion of the American record charts as leaders of a second wave of R oriented bands. In addition to Chicago blues numbers, the Rolling Stones also covered songs by Chuck Berry and Bobby and Shirley Womack, the latter's, [...] "It's All Over Now", giving them their first UK number one in 1964. After the success of their cover of [...] "Little Red Rooster" [...] in 1964, the song-writing partnership between Jagger and Richards gradually began to dominate the band's output, giving them their breakthrough international hit [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction (1965), a song which borrowed phrases and rhythms from R standards, and would be covered by both Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin. The importance of the writing partnership contributed to the <b>marginalisation</b> of Jones and marked a shift away from R material. They would investigate a series of new musical styles in their long career, but blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones' music.|$|E
500|$|After the 18-year Puritan stage ban {{was lifted}} at the Restoration {{of the monarchy}} in 1660, the {{theatrical}} life of London recreated itself quickly and abundantly. During the reign of Charles II (1660–1685), playwrights such as John Dryden, George Etherege, Aphra Behn, and William Wycherley wrote comedies that triumphantly reassert aristocratic dominance and prestige after the years of middle class power during Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth. Reflecting {{the atmosphere of the}} Court, these plays celebrate a lifestyle of sensual intrigue and conquest, especially conquest that served to humiliate the husbands of the London middle classes and to avenge, in the sensual arena, the <b>marginalisation</b> and exile suffered by royalists under Cromwell. Charles' personal interest in the stage nourished Restoration drama, and his most favoured courtiers were poets, playwrights, and men of wit, such as John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and William Wycherley. Wycherley had no title or wealth, but had by 1675 already recommended himself by two well-received comedies and had been admitted to the inner circle, sharing the conversation and sometimes the mistresses of Charles, who [...] "was extremely fond of him upon account of his wit". In 1675, at age 35, he created a sensation with The Country Wife, greeted as the bawdiest and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage.|$|E
500|$|After the Minister of Finance Enos Nkala {{railed against}} Nkomo and ZAPU at a Bulawayo {{political}} rally in November 1980, {{saying they had}} [...] "become the enemy of ZANU–PF" [...] and should be challenged by [...] "vigilante committees", ZANLA and ZIPRA veterans clashed near the city's western township of Entumbane for two days. Hundreds were killed or wounded before the Prime Minister sent ex-Rhodesian units to intervene. This incident deepened the feeling of distrust and unease that permeated {{the country and the}} National Army's integrated battalions. Concerned by ZAPU's apparent political <b>marginalisation,</b> ZIPRA commanders in Matabeleland built up their forces. Over 6,000 ZIPRA troops assembled at Gwaai River Mine, to the north-west of Bulawayo, with Soviet-made T-34 tanks, BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and anti-aircraft guns; another ZIPRA base at Essexvale, to the south-east, formed an armoured battle group including 10 T-34s. Tensions escalated further when Mugabe removed Nkomo from Home Affairs on 10 January 1981 and made him a minister without portfolio instead, in what many in Zimbabwe saw as a demotion. According to Brigadier Mike Shute, then head of the Zimbabwe National Army's 1Brigade, groups of ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas, theoretically under his command, were soon [...] "all over the place and having continual clashes and minor battles with each other". Many became convinced that a second civil war was imminent.|$|E
500|$|A new rebellion, {{sparked by}} the {{continuing}} <b>marginalisation</b> of Tatars within the Khanate government, started in 1781. Various clan leaders and their forces came together in the Taman, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea. In April 1782, {{a large portion of}} Şahin's army defected to the rebels, and joined them in the Taman. Communication between rebel leaders, including two of Şahin's brothers, and the Crimean administrative elite was ongoing. Religious (ulama) and legal (kadı) officials, important parts of the old Ottoman order, openly declared their antipathy for Şahin. Rebel forces attacked Kaffa on [...] Şahin's forces were swiftly defeated, and he was forced to escape to Russian-controlled Kerch. Rebel leaders elected Şahin's brother Bahadir Giray as Khan, and sent a message to the Ottoman government seeking recognition. It was not long, however, before Empress Catherine dispatched Prince Grigory Potemkin to restore Şahin to power. No significant opposition was fielded against the invading Russians, and many rebels fled back across the Kerch Strait. As such, the Khan was restored to his position in October 1782. By this time, however, he had lost the favour of both Crimeans and Empress Catherine. In a letter to a Russian advisor to Şahin, Catherine wrote [...] "He must stop this shocking and cruel treatment and not give them [...] just cause for a new revolt". As Russian troops entered the peninsula, work on the establishment of a Black Sea port for use by the Empire began. The city of Akitar was chosen as the site of the port, which would go on to house the newly created Black Sea Fleet. Uncertainty about the sustainability of the restoration of Şahin Giray, however, led to an increase of support for annexing Crimea, spearheaded by Prince Potemkin.|$|E
