(However, many monophonic styli had such low vertical compliance that they plowed through the vertical modulation, destroying the stereo information. This led to the common recommendation never to use a mono cartridge on a stereo record.) Conversely, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of <b>monophonic</b> <b>recording</b> equally through both channels, rather than one channel; ...|$|E
2500|$|Stereophonic sound recording, which {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} more natural listening experience by reproducing the spatial locations of sound sources in the horizontal plane, was the natural extension to <b>monophonic</b> <b>recording,</b> and attracted various alternative engineering attempts. The ultimately dominant [...] "45/45" [...] stereophonic record system was invented by Alan Blumlein of EMI in 1931 and patented the same year. EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933 (see Bell Labs Stereo Experiments of 1933) although the system was not exploited commercially until much later.|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} stylus motion can {{be represented}} {{in terms of the}} vector sum and difference of the two stereo channels.

5000|$|In {{the course}} of {{restoration}} or remastering of <b>monophonic</b> <b>records,</b> various techniques of [...] "pseudo-stereo", [...] "quasi-stereo", or [...] "rechanneled stereo" [...] {{have been used to}} create the impression that the sound was originally recorded in stereo. These techniques first involved hardware methods (see Duophonic) or, more recently, a combination of hardware and software. Multitrack Studio, from Bremmers Audio Design (The Netherlands), uses special filters to achieve a pseudo-stereo effect: the [...] "shelve" [...] filter directs low frequencies to the left channel and high frequencies to the right channel, and the [...] "comb" [...] filter adds a small delay in signal timing between the two channels, a delay barely noticeable by ear, but contributing to an effect of [...] "widening" [...] original [...] "fattiness" [...] of mono recording.|$|R

2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate groove wall, each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel and the outer wall carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a <b>monophonic</b> disk <b>recording,</b> on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. During playback, the movement of a single stylus tracking the groove is sensed independently, e.g., by two coils, each mounted diagonally opposite the relevant groove wall.|$|R
5000|$|Monaural or {{monophonic}} sound reproduction (often shortened to mono) {{is intended to}} be heard {{as if it were a}} single channel of sound perceived as coming from one position (unlike stereo, which uses two channels to convey the impression of sound coming from different places from left, middle, and right). In mono, only one loudspeaker is necessary, but, when played through multiple loudspeakers or headphones, identical signals are fed through each of the wires into each speaker, resulting in the perception of a one-channel sound, which [...] "images" [...] in one sonic space between the speakers (provided that the speakers are set up in a proper symmetrical critical-listening placement). Monaural recordings, like stereo, customarily use multiple microphones, fed into multiple channels on a recording console, but each channel is [...] "panned" [...] to be in the center. In the final stage, the various center-panned signal paths are usually mixed down to two identical tracks, which because they are identical, are perceived upon playback as representing a single unified signal in a single place in the soundstage. In some cases the multitrack source is mixed down to a one track tape becoming one signal. In the mastering stage, particularly in the days of mono records, the one-track or two-track mono master tape was then transferred to a one-track lathe intended to be used in the pressing of a <b>monophonic</b> <b>record.</b> However, today monaural recordings are usually mastered to be played on stereo and multi-track formats, yet retain their center-panned mono soundstage characteristics when played back.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first Optical Audio Reconstruction (OAR) approach {{for the long-term}} digital preservation of stereo phonograph records. OAR uses precision metrology and digital image processing to obtain and convert groove contour data into digital audio for access and preservation. This contactless and imaging-based approach has considerable advantages over the traditional mechanical methods, such as being the only optical method {{with the potential to}} restore broken stereo records. Although past efforts on <b>monophonic</b> phonograph <b>records</b> have been successful, no attempts on 33 rpm long-playing stereo records (LPs) have been reported. By using a white-light interferometry optical profiler, we are able to extract stereo audio information encoded in the 3 D profile of the phonograph record grooves. 1...|$|R

50|$|Multitrack {{recording}} of sound {{is the process}} in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as magnetic tape, which {{is divided into two}} or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating stereophonic sound (using telephone technology) was demonstrated by Clément Ader in Paris in 1881. The pallophotophone, invented by Charles A. Hoxie and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35 mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip. The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later mixdown or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track <b>monophonic</b> tape <b>recording,</b> the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British EMI engineer Alan Blumlein patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and surround sound on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of stereo tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.|$|R
3000|$|The model {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} is a source/filter representation of spot microphone signals, allowing for transmission of the multiple microphone signals of a music performance with moderate datarate requirements. This would allow for transmission through low bandwidth channels such as the current Internet infrastructure or wireless networks for broadcasting. The proposed model is tailored towards the transmission of the various microphone signals of a performance before they are mixed and thus {{can be applied to}} applications such as remote mixing and distributed performances. Our approach relaxes the current bandwidth constraints of these demanding applications, enabling their widespread usage and more clearly revealing their value. Our method operates in similar philosophy as spatial audio coding, that is, it reduces a multichannel recording into a single audio channel (which can be a sum of the multiple microphone signals) and some side information of the order of few kbps per channel. However, the focus on spot signals instead of the audio channels after the mixing process is a clear distinction between these two methods. In SAC, the side information can be used to recreate the spatial rendering of the various channels. In our method, the side information focuses on encoding the microphone signals of the multichannel recording. This {{is due to the fact}} that, for audio mixing (remote or not), not only the spatial image (as in SAC, including the [...] "flexible rendering" [...] approach of BCC) but the actual content of each (<b>monophonic)</b> microphone <b>recording</b> must be encoded, so that the audio engineer will have full control on the available content. Our algorithm results in bitrates of the same order with SAC, while being able to encode an approximate version of each mono spot signal. We note that, as in SAC, the single wideband audio channel, that needs to be transmitted for our algorithm, can be encoded using any existing method of monophonic audio compression (e.g., using perceptual audio coders). We also note our focus in low bitrate coding applications. Our objective is to obtain subjective results above 3.0 perceptual grade compared to the original recording, which can be considered a good performance for low bitrate coding applications.|$|R
