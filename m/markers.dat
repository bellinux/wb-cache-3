For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E

However, the origin or composition can rarely be defined with conventional cytogenetic technique alone. In this study, we investigated the incidences and types of <b>marker</b> chromosomes in Korean patients and attempted to establish a cost-effective diagnostic approach for <b>marker</b> chromosomes. We reviewed the karyotypes of 2, 984 patients that were requested for the cytogenetic analysis between 1997 and 2003 at the Samsung Medical Center. Ten <b>marker</b> chromosomes were found and identified using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Among the ten <b>marker</b> chromosomes, six were supernumerary <b>marker</b> chromosomes (SMCs) and the rest were <b>marker</b> chromosomes in Turner syndrome (TS). The incidence of SMCs was 2. 01 / 1, 000, slightly higher than that previously reported. Five of six SMCs were satellited <b>marker</b> chromosomes. Three bisatellited <b>marker</b> chromosomes originated from chromosome 15 and two from chromosome 22. The origin of one SMC could not be identified. All <b>marker</b> chromosomes in TS originated from X- or Y chromosome. The application of FISH is indispensable to identify <b>marker</b> chromosomes, and the appropriate selection of probes is necessary for cost-effective analysis. For analyzing satellited <b>marker</b> chromosomes, application of probes for chromosome 15 followed by those for chromosome 22 is recommended and in cases of TS, probes for sex chromosomes should take precedence...|$|R
