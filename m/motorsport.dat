5|$|As in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the standard format. Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up, in Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 3 profiles into Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits and gifted cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how many cars and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza <b>Motorsport</b> 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E
