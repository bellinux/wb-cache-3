When modeled on a 580 MW coal-fired power plant, Calcium looping experienced {{not only a}} smaller efficiency penalty (6.7-7.9% points compared to 9.5% for <b>monoethanolamine</b> and 9% for chilled ammonia) but also a less complex retrofitting process.

40|$|Professional {{cleaning}} is a {{basic service}} occupation {{with a wide variety}} of tasks carried out in all kind of different sectors and workplaces by a large workforce. One important risk for cleaning workers is the exposure to chemical substances that are present in cleaning products. <b>Monoethanolamine</b> was found to be often present in cleaning products such as general purpose cleaners, bathroom cleaners, floor cleaners and kitchen cleaners. <b>Monoethanolamine</b> can injure the skin, and exposure to <b>monoethanolamine</b> was associated to asthma even when the air concentrations were low. It is a strong irritant and known to be involved in sensitizing mechanisms. It is very likely that the use of cleaning products containing <b>monoethanolamine</b> gives rise to respiratory and dermal exposures. Therefore there is a need to further investigate the exposures to <b>monoethanolamine</b> for both, respiratory and dermal exposure. The determination of <b>monoethanolamine</b> has traditionally been difficult and analytical methods available are little adapted for occupational exposure assessments. For <b>monoethanolamine</b> air concentrations, a sampling and analytical method was already available and could be used. However, a method to analyses samples for skin exposure assessments as well as samples of skin permeation experiments was missing. Therefore one main objective of this master thesis was to search an already developed and described analytical method for the measurement of <b>monoethanolamine</b> in water solutions, and to set it up in the laboratory. <b>Monoethanolamine</b> was analyzed after a derivatisation reaction with o-pthtaldialdehyde. The derivated fluorescing <b>monoethanolamine</b> was then separated with high performance liquid chromatography and detection took place with a fluorescent detector. The method was found to be suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of <b>monoethanolamine.</b> An exposure assessment was conducted in the cleaning sector to measure the respiratory and dermal exposures to <b>monoethanolamine</b> during floor cleaning. Stationary air samples (n= 36) were collected in 8 companies and samples for dermal exposures (n= 12) were collected in two companies. Air concentrations (Mean = 0. 18 mg/m 3, Standard Deviation = 0. 23 mg/m 3, geometric Mean = 0. 09 mg/m 3, Geometric Standard Deviation = 3. 50) detected were mostly below 1 / 10 of the Swiss 8 h time weighted average occupational exposure limit. Factors that influenced the measured <b>monoethanolamine</b> air concentrations were room size, ventilation system and the concentration of <b>monoethanolamine</b> in the cleaning product and amount of <b>monoethanolamine</b> used. Measured skin exposures ranged from 0. 6 to 128. 4 mg/sample. Some cleaning workers that participated in the skin exposure assessment did not use gloves and had direct contact with the solutions containing the cleaning product and <b>monoethanolamine.</b> During the entire sampling campaign, cleaning workers mostly did not use gloves. Cleaning workers are at risk to be regularly exposed to low air concentrations of <b>monoethanolamine.</b> This exposure may be problematic if a worker suffers from allergic reactions (e. g. Asthma). In that case a substitution of the cleaning product may be a good prevention measure as several different cleaning products are available for similar cleaning tasks. Currently there are no occupational exposure limits to compare the skin exposures that were found. To prevent skin exposures, adaptations of the cleaning techniques and the use of gloves should be considered. The simultaneous skin and airborne exposures might accelerate adverse health effects. Overall the risks caused by exposures to <b>monoethanolamine</b> are considered as low to moderate when the cleaning products are used correctly. Whenever possible, skin exposures should be avoided. Further research should consider especially the dermal exposure routes, as very high exposures might occur by skin contact with cleaning products. Dermatitis but also sensitization might be caused by skin exposures. In addition, new biomedical insights are needed to better understand the risks of the dermal exposure. Therefore skin permeability experiments should be considered...|$|E

The findings show that thermal degradation at 160 °C for 8 weeks reduced <b>monoethanolamine</b> concentration by 95 %, but the remaining solvent still retained 22 % of its capacity to remove CO 2, probably due to the capacity of some of the degradation products to remove CO 2.

Successful implementation requires a host of engineering advancements, but also a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics, chemistry, and materials science at play in these highly complex systems. A large body of scholarship examines both current technologies as well as future strategies, but to date little exploration of the surface behavior of these systems has been examined. As these carbon capture systems involve uptake of gaseous CO 2 to either aqueous or solid substrates, understanding the chemistry and physics governing the boundary between the two reactant phases is critical. Yet probing the unique chemistry and physics of these interfacial systems is very difficult. This dissertation addresses this knowledge gap by examining the surface chemistry of <b>monoethanolamine</b> and CO 2. <b>Monoethanolamine</b> is a simple organic amine currently used in small scale CO 2 scrubbing, and acts as an industrial benchmark for CO 2 capture efficiency.

Perturbations to this amine surface from gaseous CO 2 and SO 2, as well as from liquid HCl, are examined in the remainder of the dissertation.
