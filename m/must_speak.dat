She thinks the Devil is the reason and vows to not let Mary Eunice be the next convert. Their meeting is {{interrupted}} with news that Dr. Arden wishes to meet with Jude. He admits {{to her that she}} was correct about Mary Eunice and seeks Jude's help. He vows loyalty to her if she can return Mary Eunice's innocence. He later lets Jude into the asylum through the kitchen entrance and she tells him she <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> to Mary Eunice alone in the office.|$|E
25|$|The Assembly (also {{called the}} Committee) convenes {{on a regular}} basis and is {{responsible}} for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee. The Assembly has a membership of a maximum of twenty-five Swiss citizens. Members <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> the house language of French, but many also speak English and German as well. These Assembly members are co-opted for a period of four years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can serve. A three-quarters majority vote from all members is required for re-election after the third term, which acts as a motivation for members to remain active and productive.|$|E
25|$|Some latent discontent between {{different}} national churches exists also {{in part due}} to different approach towards ecumenism. While the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, the Orthodox bishops in North America gathered into the Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas (SCOBA), Romanian bishops, and others are fairly open to dialog with the Roman Catholic Church, both conservative and moderate Old Calendarists, many of the monks of Mount Athos, several bishops of Russian, Serbian, and some of Greek and Bulgarian churches regard ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands in order to accommodate other Christians, and object to the emphasis on dialogue leading to inter-communion; believing instead that Orthodox <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> the truth with love, in the hope of leading to the eventual conversion to Orthodoxy of heterodox Christians.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the building's {{previous}} location within Universal Studios Florida, {{the show}} and theatre {{are not included in}} regular admission to the theme park. Instead, the theatre holds an exterior ticket booth where visitors may purchase individual tickets for the Blue Man Group performance. The tickets cost USD$64.00-$89.00 for ages 10 to Adult, and $25.00 – $34.00 for ages 3 to 9, both depending upon the locations of the seats. In addition to normal ticket options, there is also a special choice for Florida residents which includes hotel accommodations at Universal Orlando Resort, and costs $89.00 for both adults and children. The resort allows ages 3 to Adult permitted into the show, but does not recommend the show for children under age 3. Adults accompanying children under 3 <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> to the theatre's front desk to allow this age group into the show. There is no formal dress code for {{the show and}} casual clothing is permitted, though guests wearing damp or wet clothing will not be permitted into the theatre.|$|E
500|$|In May 1851, {{while in}} Boston {{attending}} the New England Anti-Slavery Society’s annual meeting, Stone {{went to the}} exhibit of Hiram Powers’s statue The Greek Slave. She was so moved by the sculpture that when she addressed the meeting that evening, she poured out her heart about the statue being emblematic of all enchained womanhood. Stone said the society’s general agent, Samuel May, Jr., reproached her for speaking on women’s rights at an antislavery meeting, and she replied, “I was a woman before I was an abolitionist. I <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> for women.” Three months later, Stone notified May that she intended to lecture on women’s rights full-time {{and would not be}} available for antislavery work.|$|E
500|$|The {{destroyed}} park is quarantined, and {{the scientist}} advises against {{a mission to}} rescue those trapped inside, fearing their exposure to [...] "pee contamination" [...] has turned them into dangerous, hate-filled mutants. To prove his theory, the scientist urinates onto a test monkey, which clearly becomes annoyed and enraged. An antidote to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys, but proven unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated on. Meanwhile, Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat, while the other boys have reached higher ground. Cartman is rescued by the occupants of an inflatable raft from a water park ride. Noticing {{he is the only}} white person in the raft, Cartman assumes he is the [...] "last of his species," [...] and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred three years early. He imagines a world in which he <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> in minority slang, is paid lower wages, and eventually forced to live in a concentration camp.|$|E

500|$|Tenders {{to create}} the mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were {{requested}} in November 2012. The tender process involved design, illustration, animation, and advertising firms exclusively from Brazil, {{in order to ensure}} a [...] "Brazilian-flavoured design". Directors from the Brazilian film festival Anima Mundi served as consultants in the process. The Rio 2016 organizers sent the agencies involved a list of 17 guidelines, among which were: ... the mascots need to reflect the local culture, but must also be universally understood; they should be aligned with the brand direction of the Rio 2016 logos and with the values of the Olympic and Paralympic movements; they must represent universal values, such as friendship, respect and fair play; they <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> to children in particular, but also resonate with adults. The organizers selected three proposed mascot designs and subjected them to a perception survey with children aged six to twelve in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The organizers presented each of the three potential mascots to the children, who were unaware that the designs were candidates for the Rio 2016 mascots and were told only about their fictional backgrounds and personality traits. The children responded with comments such as [...] "'This is my friend', 'This one seems stuck-up', 'This one has cool hair'; and 'That one looks silly'". The organizers used the children's comments to improve the mascot designs.|$|E
500|$|Late that night, on {{the night}} of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms {{carrying}} pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family [...] "Well, we're {{going to get out of}} this place." [...] They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they <b>must</b> <b>speak</b> in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.|$|E
