Retired horror comics writer and artist Stephen R. Bissette returned to write a special Halloween issue in 2012, with Tony Millionaire and Al Jaffee.

500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is so, it will be <b>my</b> <b>retirement.</b> I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." [...] He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.|$|E

500|$|In 1754, he {{was elected}} {{a fellow of the}} Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and {{resigned}} his fellowship because [...] "my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and that I never should have been called again from <b>my</b> <b>retirement</b> to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society." [...] When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the [...] "Pennant Collection", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffiths and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.|$|E
500|$|Ouro Preto {{arrived at}} the palace at 4 p.m and {{suggested}} that Pedro II nominate senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins, who would arrive in the city two days later, as the new President. Deodoro avoided meeting personally with Pedro II, but once he heard that the Emperor had chosen a personal enemy of his for the office, he finally decided on the inauguration of the Republic. The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess. For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State {{to deal with the}} situation. But she was given the reply, [...] "Later on." [...] The princess, on her own initiative, called the council members. [...] The Council assembled at 11 p.m, and after two hours recommended that the Emperor appoint Antônio Saraiva instead of Silveira Martins. After accepting the office, this politician sent an emissary to negotiate with Deodoro. But Deodoro responded that {{it was too late to}} change his mind. Upon hearing the reply, Pedro II commented, [...] "If it is so, it will be <b>my</b> <b>retirement.</b> I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1949 an American {{minister}} Reverend Kenwood Bryant visited Hoy and was {{so moved}} that he asked Mr Harry Berry, a customs officer, to create a proper headstone.

We are an Army Medical Department at war, supporting an Army at war - it shouldn't be and it isn't about one doctor." [...] Maj. Gen. Gale S. Pollock assumed the post of Acting Army Surgeon General.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his poor}} form Martyn was widely {{expected}} to retain his place due to Shane Watson's lack of fitness {{and the fact}} that the third test was to be played at the W.A.C.A. Ground, Martyn's home ground. It came as a surprise when on 8 December 2006, Martyn announced his immediate retirement from all domestic and international cricket. Commenting on his decision, Martyn said: [...] "I would like to advise of <b>my</b> <b>retirement</b> from cricket, effective from today. I do so with a deep awareness of the opportunities that the game and Cricket Australia have provided for me." [...] Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland insisted that Martyn had not been pushed and that Martyn was originally going to be named in the squad for the third Test.|$|E

I never imagined that I was going to remain here for such a long time.

Often when he spent the evening with us he would ask permission to go down into the museum and have an opportunity of privately inspecting the various specimens. You can imagine that I, as an enthusiast, was in sympathy with such a request, and that I felt no surprise at the constancy of his visits. After his actual engagement to Elise, there was hardly an evening which he did not pass with us, and an hour or two were generally devoted to the museum. He had the free run of the place, and when I have been away for the evening I had no objection to his doing whatever he wished here.
