50|$|The merger made Star Air Service {{the largest}} airline in Alaska, but money was not coming in as hoped for, and McGee was called {{back from his}} Kobuk mining {{operation}} to take over management of the company. He paid himself three percent of gross income until he accumulated all the money due him, {{then went back to}} mining. In 1935, Jack Waterworth’s pilot's license was suspended <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> stunts over Palmer during the fair. He left Star to work at Loussac's Drugstore as a pharmacist, the profession he had studied in college.|$|R
50|$|His {{stint in}} the RAF was short; he was {{dismissed}} after five <b>months</b> <b>for</b> stunt <b>flying.</b> After several odd jobs, he decided to volunteer as a pilot for the Republicans in Spain. Shortly after his arrival {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned on suspicion of spying. He was eventually freed and sent to France due to the intervention of Medora Leigh-Smith, a young Labour Party official he had met in England; his experiences gave him the material for his first novel, The Spanish Prisoner (1939). In France, Leigh-Smith found she was pregnant, and the couple soon married.|$|R
5000|$|Willem-Alexander {{is an avid}} {{pilot and}} has {{said that if he}} had not been a royal, {{he would have liked to}} be an airline pilot so he could fly big planes such as the Boeing 747. In 1989, Willem-Alexander flew as a {{volunteer}} for the African Medical Research and Education Foundation (AMREF) in Kenya, and in 1991 he spent a <b>month</b> <b>flying</b> <b>for</b> the Kenya Wildlife Service. During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal airplane on trips.|$|R
5000|$|Gilmour was to {{have flown}} a Bristol in the Gordon Bennett Trophy {{competition}} at Eastchurch, but his racing aircraft was not ready for the start: instead Gilmour made some exhibition flights in a Bristol biplane. He was also prevented from competing in the 1912 Circuit of Britain race, in which he {{was to have}} flown a Bristol Type T. On 5 July Gilmour had made a flight over central London, and was reported to have circled the dome of St Paul's cathedral before following the course of the Thames as far as Westminster Bridge, causing members of parliament to crowd the terrace of the Houses of Parliament to witness his flight. Two days later had made an appearance at the Henley Regatta, flying over the river at an altitude of between 400 and500 ft (120-150 m), before flying down and brieflyskimming the water with the aircraft's wheels. On 18 July the Royal Aero Club suspended his pilot's license <b>for</b> a <b>month</b> <b>for</b> reckless <b>flying.</b> Although complaints had been made about his alleged circling of St Paul's the Aero Club committee believed Gilmour's assertion that he had held to the course of the river, but nevertheless banned him for the flight at Henley, despite Gilmour's defence: [...] The only thing that could have happened would have been for the machine to have stopped through fouling the water in that case I should have got a ducking, to the amusement of the public and the great discomfort of myself, but without any danger to anybody. And taking into consideration the other parts of the performance, when I was flying at a height of 400 ft to 500 ft there was absolutely no danger to the public on the river as I did not pass over their heads too low down but only over the course.|$|R
50|$|The {{second of}} five children, Justiz’s love <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> began {{when his father}} took private flying lessons {{in order to get}} over his fear of heights. He took fourteen-year-old Charles with him. Charles {{immediately}} expressed his interest <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> to his father. His father, in turn, took him for an orientation lesson with his instructor. The next week, Charles quit Boy Scouts and joined the Civil Air Patrol. He began taking odd jobs to earn enough money <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> lessons and set his sights on the United States Air Force Academy.|$|R
