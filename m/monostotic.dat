50|$|<b>Monostotic</b> fibrous {{dysplasia}} (or <b>monostotic</b> osteitis fibrosa) {{is a form}} of fibrous dysplasia {{where only}} one bone is involved. It comprises a majority of the cases of fibrous dysplasia.|$|E
5000|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a mosaic}} disease that can involve any part or {{combination of the}} craniofacial, axillary, and/or appendicular skeleton. The type and severity of the complications therefore depend on the location and extent of the affected skeleton. The clinical spectrum is very broad, ranging from an isolated, asymptomatic <b>monostotic</b> lesion discovered incidentally, to severe disabling disease involving practically the entire skeleton and leading to loss of vision, hearing, and/or mobility.|$|E
50|$|Unifocal LCH, {{also called}} Eosinophilic Granuloma (an older term {{which is now}} {{known to be a}} misnomer), is a slowly {{progressing}} disease characterized by an expanding proliferation of Langerhans Cells in various bones. It can be a <b>monostotic</b> (involving only one bone) or polyostotic (involving more than one bone) disease. It typically has no extraskeletal involvement, but rarely an identical lesion {{can be found in the}} skin, lungs, or stomach. When found in the lungs, it should be distinguished from Pulmonary Langerhans cell hystiocytosis—a special category of disease most commonly seen in adult smokers. This primary bone involvement helps to differentiate Eosinophilic Granuloma from other forms of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe or Hand-Schüller-Christian variant.|$|E
5000|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a disorder}} where normal bone and marrow is replaced with fibrous tissue, resulting in formation of bone that is weak {{and prone to}} expansion. As a result, most complications result from fracture, deformity, functional impairment, and pain. [...] Disease occurs along a broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic, incidental lesions to severe disabling disease. Disease can affect one bone (<b>monostotic)</b> or multiple (polyostotic), and may occur in isolation or in combination with cafe-au-lait skin macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies, termed McCune-Albright syndrome. [...] More rarely, fibrous dysplasia {{may be associated with}} intramuscular myxomas, termed Mazabraud's syndrome. Fibrous dysplasia is very rare, and there is no known cure. Fibrous dysplasia is not a form of cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Melorheostosis is a mesenchymal {{dysplasia}} manifesting as {{regions of}} dripping wax appearance or flowing candle wax appearance. It {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation of the LEMD3 gene. The disorder can be detected by radiograph due to thickening of bony cortex resembling [...] "dripping candle wax". It is included on the spectrum of developmental bone dysplasias including pycnodysostosis and osteopoikilosis. The disorder tends to be unilateral and <b>monostotic</b> (i.e. affecting a single bone), with only one limb typically involved. Cases with involvement of multiple limbs, ribs, and bones in the spine have also been reported. There are no reported cases of involvement of skull or facial bones. Melorheostosis can be associated with pain, physical deformity, skin and circulation problems, contractures, and functional limitation. It is also associated with a benign inner ear dysplasia known as osteosclerosis.|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a sporadic benign skeletal {{disorder that}} can affect one bone (<b>monostotic</b> form) or multiple bones (polyostotic bone). Around 6 – 20 % of <b>monostotic</b> FD occurs in the ribs. The objective {{of this study was}} to report our experience in the management of the <b>monostotic</b> FD of the ribs. Between January 2004 and December 2009, seven cases of FD of the rib (six men and one woman, mean age 30. 4 years, range 17 – 40 years) were operated on. The patients were evaluated with plain radiographs and computer tomog-raphy (CT). All our patients were symptomatic; two patients presented chest pain and swelling and other patients presented only chest pain. One rib was involved in all our patients (<b>monostotic</b> form) : the site was fifth rib (four cases), sixth rib (two cases) or second rib (one case). Radiologically, plain films and CT showed an expansible lesion with a ground-glass centre and thinning of the cortex. Rib re-section was performed in all patients; there were no postoperative complications and no recurrence in all cases at mean 43 month follow-up. In symptomatic <b>monostotic</b> FD of ribs, the involved segment of bone may be excised to rule out malignancy and for painful lesions...|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} of FD lesions {{depends on the}} form of the disease. <b>Monostotic</b> FD accounts for about 80 % of patients with FD. The most common location of <b>monostotic</b> FD is the rib, skull and femur. In the polyostotic form, the skull, mandible, pelvic bones and femur are the most frequently affected sites. Many cases of <b>monostotic</b> FD are discovered incidentally, while the polyostotic form is usually diagnosed during {{the first few years of}} life, and the majority of bony lesions become non-silent and clinically significant by age 10 years, with almost no new lesions appearing after the age of 15. There is no difference in appearance of bony lesions between FD, MAS and Mazabraud syndrome, but syndromic patients typically have polyostotic disease.|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is {{a benign}} dysplastic pathology of bone-forming mesenchymal cells, resulting in replacement of trabecular bone by abnormal fibrous and immature osseous tissue. FD {{can be either}} <b>monostotic</b> or polyostotic, is more often unilateral, and {{can be part of}} the McCune-Albright syndrome (MIM 174800). Sarcomatous degeneration in FD is rare, ranging from less than 1 % in <b>monostotic</b> forms to 4 % in the McCune-Albright syndrome. We report the case of a 59 -year-old woman with <b>monostotic</b> FD of the left ischium, known for over 30 years, who developed sarcomatous transformation in a low-grade spindle-cell sarcoma. The value of F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the early diagnosis of malignant transformation, the evaluation of distant metastasis, as well as monitoring the efficacy of chemotherapy are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A case of <b>monostotic</b> fibrous {{dysplasia}} of a {{long bone}} of the hand is reported. There has been only one similar case recorded, {{though it is not}} uncommon in other long bones. The diagnosis was proved by histology, and the turnout treated by subperiosteai excision. There has been no recurrence after 31 months, though in similar cases excision including the periosteum has been advised to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Lichtenstein (1938), described a disorder of expanding fibro-osseous lesions, and introduced the term fibrous dysplasia. The term now describes a distinct skeletal developmental anomaly of bone forming mesenchyme which may affect one or more bones. The aetiology is unknown and it is not hereditary. The polyostotic variety, and rarely the <b>monostotic</b> form, when associated with cutaneous pigmentation and endocrine abnormality is known as Albright's yndrome. <b>Monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia is the most common for...|$|E
30|$|Out {{of the ten}} <b>monostotic</b> {{patients}} in our series, only one presented with shepherd crook deformity, four had significantly displaced pathologic fractures, and five had a painful lesion. Average age at surgery was 11.4  years as compared to 13.5  years in the polyostotic group. Patient age is important as <b>monostotic</b> lesions remain active only until skeletal maturity whereas polyostotic lesions may progress even during adulthood [1]. Two of the patients required an additional procedure and 80  % of the patients had a satisfactory result overall. These findings concur with the literature that <b>monostotic</b> lesions are easier to treat, have good outcomes, and require fewer number of procedures [2]. One of the patients that presented with a bony lytic lesion with pain had undergone only curettage and biopsy for diagnosis. The same patient suffered a pathologic fracture four weeks later and had to undergo intramedullary nailing for the same.|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a benign}} fibroosseous lesion characterised by {{the replacement of}} normal bone by excessive proliferation of cellular fibrous connective tissue which is slowly replaced by bone, osteoid, or cementum-like material.

30|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a slowly progressing bone lesion {{resulting from}} the displacement of normal medullary bone with abnormal fibro-osseous connective tissue. FD can be classified as <b>monostotic</b> when it involves a single bone and polyostotic when it involves multiple bones [1]. The former has an incidence of 70 – 80 %, while the latter {{may be seen in}} 20 – 30 % of patients with FD [13 – 15]. The <b>monostotic</b> form is usually asymptomatic, whereas the polyostotic form, accompanied by various endocrine disorders, irregular skin pigmentation, and early sexual maturity, is called McCune–Albright syndrome [1, 3, 16]. The <b>monostotic</b> type is more prevalent in the maxilla in the craniomaxillofacial skeleton [1, 3, 17]. In a patient whose only clinical feature is <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia, biopsy and identification of a somatic gene mutation may be required to confirm the diagnosis [1]. However, many experienced clinicians and radiologists will often notice that a lesion appears characteristic of FD on radiographic examination because it is an expansile and intramedullary lesion with a ground-glass appearance, thus diagnosing FD without the need for biopsy in typical cases [3]. Diagnosis can also be made by histologic examination of the biopsied tissue. The typical microscopic features of FD include a background of loosely arranged fibrous stroma with irregularly shaped bony trabeculae. The bone trabeculae are thin and disconnected to each other and have been described as “Chinese characters” [1, 3, 12, 18].|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{pituitary}} adenomas {{have been}} described in association with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in McCune-Albright Syndrome, no such relationship has been described with <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia. The authors describe a case of <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia of the sphenoid bone and concomitant pituitary adenoma in a 25 -year-old male. To the authors’ knowledge {{this is the first}} such case reported in the literature. Clinical presentation, pathology, and surgical approach are described in detail. Case Description: A 25 -year-old male initially presented with headaches, gynecomastia, and galactorrhea. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a sellar/suprasellar mass possibly consistent with a calcified pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma and a cranial base lesion obstructing the sphenoid sinus consistent with fibrous dysplasia. Both lesions were accessible via an endoscopic transnasal approach. The patient underwent resection of the affected sphenoid bone which allowed appropriate exposure for subsequent resection of the pituitary lesion without major complication. Pathology and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diagnoses and postoperative imaging revealed gross total resection of the adenoma. Conclusions: The authors describe a case of <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia of the sphenoid bone and pituitary adenoma. Resection of such dual lesions can be both safe and efficacious via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} of bone is {{an enigma}} with no known cure. Treatment currently consists of curet-tage and bone-grafting {{in an attempt}} to eradicate the lesion and to prevent progressive deformity. This study presents the results of prophylactic intramedullary nailing in 10 patients with <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia, pain increasing with movement, and scintigraphically established activity. Ten patients with <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia in their upper or lower extremities treated between 2001 and 2003 were included in the study. Seven patients were male and 3 were female; their mean age was 26. 9 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 33. 5 months. Closed intramedullary nail without reaming was used in all cases. Bone grafting was not performed. Patients were allowed full weight bearing on the affected extremities on the second postopera-tive day. Mean VAS for functional pain was 5. 33 ± 0. 65 preop-eratively and 2. 26 ± 0. 57 at final follow-up (p < 0. 05). Radiographs showed no changes in lesion size, and the intramedullary fixation appeared to be stable.

40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a benign}} fibroosseous bone dysplasia that can involve single (<b>monostotic)</b> or multiple (polyostotic) bones. <b>Monostotic</b> form is more frequent in the jaws.

30|$|The {{management}} of FD remains a challenge. It {{is thought that}} the type of intervention should be guided by patient age, lesion characteristics (site, size and biological behaviour) and the presence of a significant deformity or fracture [6]. Asymptomatic lesions found incidentally in patients with the <b>monostotic</b> form are generally managed expectantly.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 25 -year-old Caucasian woman with {{symptomatic}} <b>monostotic</b> fibrous dysplasia of the fourth lumbar vertebral body. The patient suffered from a five-week history of progressive low back pain, radiating continuously to the left leg. Her medical history and physical and neurological examination did not demonstrate any significant abnormalities. Radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an osteolytic expansive lesion with a cystic component of the fourth lumbar vertebral body. Percutaneous transpedicular biopsy showed histological characteristics of fibrous dysplasia superimposed by the formation of aneurysmal bone cyst components. The patient was treated by subtotal vertebrectomy of the L 4 vertebral body with anterior reconstruction and her postoperative course was uncomplicated.

30|$|There are no {{medications}} {{capable of}} altering the disease course; therefore, {{the treatment of}} the disease is mainly palliative, focusing on optimising function and minimising morbidity related to deformities and fractures. Antiresorptive therapy with bisphosphonates has been advocated due to high levels of bone resorbtion frequently seen in FD tissue; while these medications may be helpful for FD-related bone pain, {{there is no evidence that}} they improve bone quality or a radiographic appearance of FD lesions. Treatment of <b>monostotic</b> FD is dependent on symptom management and clinical presentation. The typical asymptomatic lesion, which is identified incidentally, requires the follow-up with serial radiographs to confirm that the lesion is biologically inactive and mechanically insignificant. Symptomatic or atypical lesions may require surgical excision for histological confirmation. Surgical interventions for pain relief are rarely effective. When surgical interventions are indicated, <b>monostotic</b> lesions are typically treated with conventional surgical procedures.|$|E
30|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a benign, developmental, nonheritable, {{and slowly}} progressing disorder {{of the bone}} characterized by replacement of the normal bone by gradual abnormal proliferation of immature, irregularly distributed fibro-osseous connective tissue. FD {{is caused by a}} gene mutation that affects both bone formation and resorption [1, 2]. The skeletal involvement varies from <b>monostotic</b> (single bone) to polyostotic (multiple bones), leading to progressive functional deficits and reduced esthetics. When FD involves only one bone, and not contiguous multiple bones in the skull, the disease is characterized as <b>monostotic</b> rather than polyostotic [3]. Therefore, craniofacial FD without involving other skeleton, such as the femur or rib, would be commonly defined as <b>monostotic</b> FD [4]. The maxilla and frontal bones are the most commonly involved bones in the craniofacial region. The typical appearance of patients with FD of the maxillofacial bone is facial asymmetry caused by a significant expansion of the bone [2]. When the maxilla is involved, an increase in the prominence of cheek is observed. Since the craniofacial FD is not well delineated, conservative surgical debulking is usually performed to restore the facial contour. However, the FD lesion sometimes affects the alveolar bones of the maxilla or mandible, causing discrepancy in the occlusion secondary to the alveolar bone expansion. In such cases, complete osteotomy and repositioning of the maxilla or mandibular bones must be performed concomitantly with debulking of the lesion [5 – 10].|$|E

40|$|Aim. Fibrous {{dysplasia}} {{is a rare}} bone disease {{caused by}} missense mutation leading to abnormal fibroblast and osteoblast proliferation and increased bone resorption. FD can present in <b>monostotic</b> or polyostotic forms. About 3 % of FD could be in association with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS).
