5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|As she did on Survivor, Beyoncé took a wider {{role in the}} {{production}} of Dangerously in Love, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> mastering of tracks. Although Beyoncé did not create beats, she came up with melodies and ideas she shared with the producers. With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album— Beyoncé is credited as co-writer and co-producer, as well as the album's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his unauthorised {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E

5|$|Model was {{the master}} of the type of defense which can be called 'defense limited in time'; in which you defend as long as {{possible}} but then retreat to avoid breakthrough and destruction. He was always at the critical points and took away battlegroups or even single battalions from less threatened sectors. With these units holes were plugged at other locations or short counterattacks were executed and so opportunities were created for bigger solutions. Thus, a closed front was guaranteed while the <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> tearing apart of units was viewed as the smaller evil.|$|E

5|$|Petrographically, the {{composition}} of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62.8% to 65.7%. Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> mingling.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{employed}} low-fidelity recording equipment, {{which allowed}} him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording Illinois. Typically, his process involved recording to 32kHz 8-track tape using inexpensive microphones such as the Shure SM57 and AKG C1000. He then employed Pro Tools for <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> other production tasks.|$|E

Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental piece of music.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed {{in part because of}} his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music <b>mixing,</b> <b>and</b> visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates {{that it could}} have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of wrought iron and cast iron to make steel comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process of <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> heating wrought iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E
5|$|Dangerously in Love is {{the debut}} solo studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} worldwide on June 24, 2003 through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment {{and in the}} United Kingdom on June 23, 2003. During the recording of Destiny's Child's third studio album Survivor (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released.

5|$|Filming for King Kong {{took place}} in New Zealand from September 2004 to March 2005. The project's budget climbed from an initial $150 million to a then-record-breaking $207 million. It was {{released}} on December 14, 2005 in Germany and on December 16 in the United States, and made an opening of $50.1 million. While it performed lower than expected, King Kong made domestic and worldwide grosses that eventually added up to $550 million, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film in Universal Pictures history at the time. It also generated $100 million in DVD sales upon its home video release. The film garnered positive reviews from critics and appeared on several top ten lists for 2005. It was praised for its special effects, performances, sense of spectacle and comparison to the 1933 original. It won three Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound <b>Mixing</b> <b>and</b> Best Visual Effects.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the {{possibility}} of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> mastering was also completed in Sydney. AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well.|$|E
