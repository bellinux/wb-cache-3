5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|The tide of war turns {{against the}} Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg in which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Ashley {{while he is}} visiting on Christmas furlough, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manned</b> {{operations}} in <b>the</b> UK have added value {{services such as}} ironing, dry cleaning and service washes, which prove popular to busy professionals, students, and senior citizens. Student accommodation blocks often have their own unmanned laundries, which are typically commercially run at a profit by the accommodation provider.|$|R

5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E
5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as they said that 50,000 Copperheads would {{be there for the}} event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> thought Anderson may have been a double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume <b>the</b> punishing schedule <b>of</b> 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil War {{brought some}} relief, {{although}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> returning <b>men</b> were {{too weak to}} plant the year's crops. [...] The Confederate currency that the remaining residents had saved was now worthless.|$|R

5|$|On 13 September 908, Flann, {{aided by}} his {{son-in-law}} Cerball mac Muirecáin, and Cathal mac Conchobair, King of Connacht, {{fought against the}} Munstermen, again led by Cormac and Flaithbertach, at the Battle of Bellaghmoon (near Castledermot, County Kildare). The Fragmentary Annals report that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Munster had not wished to {{set out on the}} expedition. This was because Flaithbertach had fallen from his horse at the muster, an event which was taken to be an ill-omen. Flann and his allies subsequently defeated the Munstermen. Cormac, along with Cellach mac Cerbaill of Osraige and many other notables, was killed.|$|E
5|$|The NK 9th Division's {{infantry}} {{crossing of}} the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company, north of A Company. There the North Koreans assaulted in force, signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles. The company held its positions {{only a short time}} and then attempted to escape. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> moved south, a few of them coming into A Company's ridge line positions near Agok during the night. Most of C Company moved {{all the way to the}} 25th Division positions south of the Naktong. On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Saddam Hussein over 202,000 {{refugees}} fled Iraq to {{refugee camps}} in Iran. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young <b>men</b> and children who lived in these camps were recruited by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps in anticipation of repatriation back into Iraq.|$|R

50|$|The Choctaw were {{required}} to release their slaves by <b>the</b> Reconstruction Treaty <b>of</b> 1866. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freed <b>men</b> remained in <b>the</b> Choctaw Nation lands. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> these were legally adopted into the Choctaw Nation in 1885, thus qualifying for land allotments by the Dawes Commission.|$|R
5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers; {{a major problem for}} the authorities was that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause. The additional possibility of the capital being bombarded forced the National Congress of Brazil to give in to the rebels' demands. The demands included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret. Its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
5|$|Though Ross was {{concerned}} about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll {{at the beginning of the}} 18901891 school year. Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted, though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had no running water, faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas {{leave the}} company {{concentrated}} at Balcombe in Victoria {{where it was}} officially disbanded on 20 April 1945, although <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> continued to serve in other signals units {{until the end of}} the war. Although complete records were unable to be maintained, a nominal roll of the unit lists the names of approximately 792 men that served in the NGAWW. During its service, the unit lost eight men killed in action, while another three died of other causes while on active service. The company had the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II, with its members receiving one Member of the Order of the British Empire, ten Military Medals, and ten Mentions in Despatches. Numerous Commendation Cards were also awarded by the Commander-In-Chief. Flight Lieutenant Leigh Vial (then an RAAF pilot officer working as a Coastwatcher) was also awarded the US Distinguished Service Cross for service behind the lines around Salamaua during a joint mission with NGAWW personnel.|$|E
50|$|The Rudolph Oyster House is {{a typical}} cullhouse. Very lightly {{constructed}} with no amenities, it {{was never meant to}} be a permanent structure. Walking through the building, you can see, preserved in the rafters <b>the</b> carved names <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young <b>men</b> who worked here.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>men</b> {{who participated}} in the inauguration took part in the funeral. Johnson's casket traveled <b>the</b> entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state, and exiting through the House wing; this was due to construction on the East Front steps.|$|R
50|$|Brief Lives is a British {{play about}} John Aubrey, a 17th-century Englishman who met and kept {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous <b>men</b> <b>of</b> his day, including René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes and Christopher Wren. It premiered in 1967 {{and became one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most successful one person shows in history. Roy Dotrice played Aubrey in many productions.|$|R
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{on board}} were {{soldiers}} with no training for {{what to do}} {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army telephoned Colonel Ernest V. Holmes, Chief of Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, {{and told}} him that the 1st Cavalry Division had {{responsibility}} for the Walled City. Holmes replied he would send a company of engineers to Ka-san. Holmes ordered Lieutenant Colonel William C. Holley, commanding officer of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, to report to Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment. That afternoon Palmer in his command post on the Tabu-dong road outlined to Holley and the commanding officers of D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, and E Company, 8th Cavalry, his attack plan to regain control of Ka-san. The Engineer company, commanded by First Lieutenant John T. Kennedy, was to lead the attack, E Company following. Once the force had gained the crest and E Company had established itself in defensive positions, the Engineer company was to come off the mountain. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in D Company were veteran infantrymen who had fought in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Blasted {{from living}} rock this jail {{confined}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bad <b>men</b> who {{crowded into the}} district in the boom days. Local tradition says that the first inmate in 1881 was the miner who built the jail. It was contributed to the town by the Lesinsky Brothers who built the first copper smelter on Chase Creek.|$|R

50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lennox <b>men</b> {{were killed}} {{either on the}} ridge or along <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river Avon. <b>The</b> Earl <b>of</b> Glencairn was {{captured}} and Lennox himself was wounded. Lennox surrendered to his opponents but was then murdered by James Hamilton <b>of</b> Finnart. <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> Lennox’s murder is commemorated with a cairn that stands {{at the entrance to}} the Kettilstoun estate.|$|R
5|$|The battle exacted a heavy {{toll on the}} 1st Airborne Division {{from which}} it would never recover. Three {{quarters}} of the formation were missing when it returned to England, including {{two of the three}} brigade commanders, eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders. Some 500 men were still in hiding north of the Rhine, and over the coming months many of these were able to escape: initially in Operation Pegasus. New recruits, escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months, but the division was still so much weakened that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to be merged into the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the division as a whole could barely produce two brigades of infantry. Between May and August 1945, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee the German surrenders there but on their return the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The first {{enlisted men}} to be {{recruited}} in 1873 came {{from a wide variety}} of backgrounds, but most had some military experience. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> enlisting in this tranche were later dismissed as unsuitable for service, less than half completing their term of enlistment, and more care was taken in later recruiting. Initially, a majority of the force were of Canadian origin but the number originating from Britain rose steadily during the 1880s until they made up over half of all new recruits, with British-born mounted police also tending to predominate in the non-commissioned cadre, mainly because they chose to stay longer in the force. Although the number of Canadian-born recruits increased for a while, the economic boom of the 1910s made the task much harder, and the mounted police opened a recruitment office in London; by 1914 almost 80 percent of the force had been born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{state board}} that {{controlled}} the militia considered {{it to be}} pro-secessionist and ordered it to store its arms. On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that {{he could no longer}} perform his duties due to the board's actions. That August he was twice offered a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army—the first from general in chief Winfield Scott, and the second from Secretary of War Simon Cameron following the personal order of President Abraham Lincoln—but he declined. After Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, Kentucky, violating the state's neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on September 14, 1861, and was followed by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> he formerly commanded in the state militia. When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action might be taken against his wife's property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.) He became a division commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. William J. Hardee and was stationed in Bowling Green, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|A large {{collection}} of Hinde's diaries are held among the Lyman Draper Manuscripts in the Wisconsin Historical Society. In his diaries Hinde {{stated that he}} supported the Hollow Earth theory. Throughout his life Hinde maintained correspondence with <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prominent <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day.
