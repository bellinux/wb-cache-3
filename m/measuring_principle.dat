5000|$|The pressure/step {{stability}} method [...] {{represents an}} alternative for the pressure scan method which permits {{a more accurate}} measurement of the pore sizes. It {{takes into account the}} different tortuosity and pore length of pores with the same diameter. The acquisition of a data point is only carried out after holding the pressure at a constant value for a user-defined time (see figure 2) and also only after the gas flow through the sample is stable, which is also defined by the user. This allows enough time for the gas flow to displace the wetting liquid in long and tortuous pores of the same diameter. Therefore the pressure step/stability method is the most recommended one for research and development applications.Additionally, the pressure step/stability <b>measuring</b> <b>principle</b> allows measuring the true First Bubble Point (FBP), in opposition to the pressure scan method, which only permits calculation the FBP at the selected flow rates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Precise {{measurement}} of tooth profile errors {{is the key}} technology for realizing close-loop manufacturing of spiral bevel gears. The <b>measuring</b> <b>principle</b> of tooth profile errors and the processing method of measuring datum is the key technology for realizing precise measuring. Based on the generating principle of spiral bevel gears and the model of CNC machine tool, the on-machine <b>measuring</b> <b>principle</b> and the measuring datum processing method were established. In order to verify the correctness of on-machine <b>measuring</b> <b>principle,</b> the on-machine measuring simulation system was established based on AutoCAD development platform. According to the spatial coordinates and normal vector of the discrete points of theoretical tooth profile, the on-machine {{measurement of}} tooth profile errors was simulated by intersection Boolean operation and the values of errors were calculated. The correctness of simulation algorithm is validated by comparing simulation result with the practical measuring result. Preface Spiral bevel gears are used to transmit the movement and power between the intersecting axes. In order to advance the manufacturing precision and machining efficiency, Gleason and Klingelnberg puts forward close-loop manufacturing technology[1, 2].

40|$|A new {{principle}} for measuring soil CO 2 efflux at constant ambient concentration is introduced. The <b>measuring</b> <b>principle</b> {{relies on the}} continuous absorption of CO 2 within the system to achieve a constant CO 2 concentration inside the soil chamber at ambient level, thus balancing the amount of CO 2 entering the soil chamber by diffusion from the soil. We report results that show reliable soil CO 2 efflux measurements with the new system. The novel <b>measuring</b> <b>principle</b> does not disturb the natural gradient of CO 2 within the soil, while allowing for continuous capture of the CO 2 released from the soil. It therefore holds great potential for application in simultaneous measurements of soil CO 2 efflux and its d 13 C, since both variables show sensitivity to a distortion of the soil CO 2 profile commonly found in conventional chamber technique...|$|E
