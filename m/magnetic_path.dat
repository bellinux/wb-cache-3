To analyse these magnetic circuits, we introduced the electrical eqcuivalent circuits and obtained the general fundamental equations for each core. Then, we drew the linear-numerical solutions using an electronic computer, and cleared {{the relationships between the}} sizes of a core and the amplitudes and phase angles of fluxes in <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths.</b> Related with the above facts, we investigate the influence of these sizes on the core loss using cores of various quality...|$|R

50|$|In some {{applications}} increased leakage is desired, {{and long}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths,</b> air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design {{to limit the}} short-circuit current it will supply.

40|$|A linear {{reciprocating}} {{machine has}} a tubular outer stator housing a coil, a plunger and an inner stator. The plunger has four axially spaced rings of radially magnetized permanent magnets which cooperate {{two at a}} time with the stator to complete first or second opposite <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths.</b> The four rings of magnets and the stators are arranged so that the stroke of the plunger is independent of the axial length of the coil...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{improvements}} {{can be made}} on {{the basic}} design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid's pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a <b>magnetic</b> return <b>path</b> around the outside of the solenoid (an [...] "iron-clad solenoid"). The <b>magnetic</b> return <b>path,</b> just as the stop, has little impact until the air gap is small.|$|R
50|$|The {{toroidal}} {{shape of}} a core is preferred since the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path</b> is closed, there are no magnetic poles and thus very little external flux. This allows the cores to be packed closely together without allowing their magnetic fields to interact. The alternating 45-degree positioning in a core array helps to reduce any stray coupling.|$|E
50|$|The {{core tube}} {{contains}} and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize {{the movement of}} the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic. If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines. In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by deep drawing. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path</b> resistance because the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path</b> must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>path</b> is {{characterized}} by poles, locations at equal angles around the rotor at which the magnetic field lines pass from stator to rotor or vice versa. The stator (and rotor) are classified {{by the number of}} poles they have. Most arrangements use one field coil per pole.

40|$|The novel {{switched}} reluctance generator (SRG) with hybrid <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths</b> {{is developed}} for wind power generation in this paper. For the proposed SRG, {{there is no}} mutual coupling between phase windings. The proposed SRG has the longitudinal magnetic structure at the completely aligned position. However, it has the transverse and longitudinal magnetic structure at the unaligned position. Thus, three-dimensional finite element computation is needed in the design.

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of a ferromagnetic core, such as iron, increases {{the magnitude of the}} magnetic flux density in the solenoid and raises the effective permeability of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path.</b> This is expressed by the formulawhere μeff is the effective or apparent permeability of the core. The effective permeability {{is a function of the}} geometric properties of the core and its relative permeability. The terms relative permeability (a property of just the material) and effective permeability (a property of the whole structure) are often confused; they can differ by many orders of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|Toroidal {{transformers}} {{are more}} efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because {{of the lack of}} a residual gap in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path,</b> toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times resonance circuit has a flat shape. Although the <b>magnetic</b> <b>path</b> structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the step-up transformer is increased to some degree, whereby a resonance circuit is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the step-up transformer. The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary side circuit. The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a resonance capacitor. As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the step-up transformer is further miniaturized.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the magnetic circuit, it was realised that multiple <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths</b> could be provided through the same armature. The two coils were now separated and placed at the sides of the motor, with their iron core as a sideways figure-8 circuit and the armature in a central pole gap. Flux from both coils passed through this gap. This gave a magnetic circuit that was shorter overall and thus had fewer magnetic losses. The more compact coil windings were made possible by the use of shellac for impregnating the windings and improving the reliability of their insulation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design approach for doubly salient permanent magnet (DSPM) motors, aiming {{to minimize the}} torque ripple. The key is to propose the design criteria that the reluctance of all <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths</b> is the same, and the armature windings can be artfully connected to compensate the variation of self-inductance. Based on these criteria, the magnetic characteristics become symmetric, and the variation of self inductance is suppressed. Thus, the resulting torque ripple can be minimized. By using the time-stepping finite element method, the proposed DSPM motor and the existing DSPM motor are quantitatively compared {{in terms of their}} back-EMFs, self-inductances, and torque ripples, hence confirming the validity of the proposed design approach. © 2009 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

For air-gap in a TLSRA, there are the longitudinal and transverse <b>magnetic</b> <b>paths</b> due to various mover positions. Change in air-gap permeance in a TLSRA results in the thrust force, which drives the mover for linear motion. Thus, the air-gap permeance is the crucial parameter for computing the thrust force in the electromagnetic design and estimating the real-time thrust force in force control of TLSRAs. In general, the air-gap permeance at two special positions can be calculated analytically, such as the maximum and minimum air-gap permeance[3]. It is a challenging issue that an analytically model is developed to compute the air-gap permeance at arbitrary mover positions. This paper focuses on that permeance model development.
