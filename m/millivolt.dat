5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of <b>millivolt.</b> Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E

25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} <b>millivolt</b> control systems, extend the {{thermocouple}} concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

Five components were resolved whose oxidation-reduction reactions corresponded to two-electron changes, as expected for flavoproteins. The midpoint potentials at pH 7. 2 are as follows, listed in order of increasingly negative potential: + 170 <b>millivolts,</b> + 110 <b>millivolts,</b> + 20 <b>millivolts,</b> − 70 <b>millivolts,</b> and − 155 <b>millivolts.</b> The most negative component was highly fluorescent; the other components could only be identified by their characteristic absorbance changes. In addition to these components, which are mitochondrial, variable amounts of a very highly fluorescent flavoprotein with a midpoint potential of − 215 <b>millivolts</b> was found. This component appears to be extra-mitochondrial. The same midpoint potential values at pH 7. 2 were obtained with mitochondria in the uncoupled state as in mitochondria energized with ATP in the absence of phosphate...|$|R

These include nanovoltmeters, electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very high source resistance, such as one teraohm) and picoammeters. [...] Accessories for more typical multimeters permit some of these measurements, as well. Such measurements are limited by available technology, and ultimately by inherent thermal noise.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{device is}} {{generally}} considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in {{the same way a}} dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces.

40|$|Existence of a proton-translocating ATPase on the {{tonoplast}} {{of higher}} plants has been further confirmed {{by use of}} two experimental systems: (a) intact isolated vacuoles from sugarcane cells and (b) vesicles prepared from the same source. Addition of MgATP to vacuoles polarized the tonoplast by 40 <b>millivolts</b> to a value of + 20 <b>millivolts,</b> but a large preexisting pH gradient across the membrane restricted the pH change to 0. 2 unit. In vesicle preparations, the tonoplast was polarized to + 66 <b>millivolts</b> {{by the addition of}} MgATP and the intravesicular space was acidified by 1 pH unit to pH 5. 5. Proton translocation equilibrium is controlled by the protonmotive potential difference, maximal at 125 <b>millivolts</b> for sugarcane cells.
