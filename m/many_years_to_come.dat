5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I mean, I disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay {{were known to be}} excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Like his grandfather, Edward III {{took steps}} to restore royal power, but during the 1340s the Black Death arrived in England. The losses from the epidemic, and the {{recurring}} plagues that followed it, significantly affected events in England for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Meanwhile, Edward, under pressure from France in Aquitaine, made a challenge for the French throne. Over the next century, English forces fought many campaigns in a long-running conflict that {{became known as the}} Hundred Years' War. Despite the challenges involved in raising the revenues to pay for the war, Edward's military successes brought an influx of plundered wealth to many parts of England and enabled substantial building work by the king. Many members of the English elite, including Edward's son the Black Prince, were heavily involved in campaigning in France and administering the new continental territories.|$|E
5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after {{a second set of}} notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E

25|$|The Three Trillion Dollar War (co-authored with Linda Bilmes) {{examines}} {{the full cost}} of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses {{the extent to which these}} costs will be imposed for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.|$|E
25|$|Gay discos also {{experienced}} occasional police raids, {{the most well-known}} of which occurred at Rascals on 30 May 1993, where policemen shouted rudely at patrons. A gay lawyer who was present later enlisted the support of 21 other gay professionals in writing a letter of complaint to the Chief of Police. To their surprise, they received an apology. This was the last documented case of police harassment at gay discos for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

The mother's influence was very strong there.” Among others, Terlingua is the great-great-grandam of 2015 U.S. Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.|$|R
25|$|Parker contributed {{greatly to}} the modern jazz solo, one in which {{triplets}} and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist with more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided. Parker was admired for his unique style of phrasing and innovative use of rhythm. Via his recordings and {{the popularity of the}} posthumously published Charlie Parker Omnibook, Parker's identifiable style dominated jazz for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|In November 1095 - Pope Urban II preached the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont. The crusades {{would affect}} {{everything}} in Europe and the Middle East for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and literature would, along with everything else, be {{transformed by the}} wars between these two cultures. For instance {{the image of the}} knight would take on a different significance. Also the Islamic emphasis on scientific investigation and the preservation of the Greek philosophical writings would eventually affect European literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{remained on}} site until 15 November.

In 1963, the locomotive was returned to Sweden, where it is currently on display at the Swedish Railway Museum in Gävle.|$|E
5000|$|N.Gopala Rao is {{also known}} as the [...] "Father of Modern Art" [...] of Andhra Pradesh was an Indian painter. He was a renowned painter during the early 20th century during British Raj in South India, who {{achieved}} recognition for his paintings on Hindu epics, landscapes, portraits of maharajahs and maharanis of his days.

25|$|In 1989, two {{long-term}} members departed. One was bassist Rick Kemp, {{who needed}} to recover from a serious shoulder injury, exacerbated by playing bass on stage. His eventual replacement (after two tours, each with a different bassist) was Tim Harries, who was brought {{in less than two}} weeks before the band was scheduled to start a tour. A friend of Pegrum's, Harries was a self-taught rock bassist, as well as a classically trained pianist and double bassist. With Harries on board, Steeleye released Tempted and Tried (1989), an album that formed the basis for their live set for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 11 December 1998, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{responded to}} a gay man's {{question}} about the place of homosexuals in Singapore, live on CNN International by saying, '...what we are doing as a government is to leave people to live their own lives {{so long as they}} don't impinge on other people. I mean, we don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are concerned, of the decade.|$|E
25|$|October 3, 1924 was {{the first}} time Roosevelt {{traveled}} to Warm Springs, Georgia and it soon became his home away from home.

On April 29, 1926 he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients. One of Roosevelt's major goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health. It is now the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the State of Georgia.|$|E

25|$|Karadžić {{continued}} collecting song {{well into}} the 1830s. He arrived in Montenegro {{in the fall of}} 1834. Infirm, he descended to the Bay of Kotor to winter there, and returned in the spring of 1835. It was there that Karadžić met Vuk Vrčević, an aspiring littérateur, born in Risan. From then on Vrčević became Karadžić's faithful and loyal collaborator who collected folk songs and tales and sent them to his address in Vienna for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Another equally diligent collaborator of Vuk Karadžić was another namesake from Boka Kotorska the Priest Vuk Popović. Both Vrčević and Popović were steadily and uselfishly involved in the gathering of the ethnographic, folklore and lexical material for Karadžić. Later, other collaborators joined Karadžić, including Milan Đ. Milićević.|$|E
25|$|Better {{dental health}} overall coupled with {{increased}} demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, {{have resulted in a}} steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E

A gallant squad coached by ex-NHL defensive whiz Jim Roberts sneaked into the playoffs in the final week {{in part due to}} veteran minor-league goaltender Rick Knickle's (signed when injuries both in Springfield and Long Island sidelined the Indians' top three goaltenders) eight game undefeated streak, and on May 18, 1990, the team knocked off the heavily favored Rochester Americans in six games in the finals for the franchise's sixth Calder Cup. Future NHL goaltender Jeff Hackett won the playoff MVP, inspirational leader Rod Dallman provided tons of grit, while names such as Marc Bergevin, Tom Fitzgerald, team captain Rob DiMaio, Jeff Finley and Bill Berg were heard from by NHL fans for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
