A motivation for {{this study is to}} investigate wave propagation inside an enclosed environment such as elevator, car, aircraft, and spacecraft. There are performances and safety concerned that when the RF transmitters are used in the metallic enclosed environments. In this paper, the field distributions inside a confined room were investigated with <b>multiple</b> <b>portable</b> Wi-Fi devices. Computer simulations were performed using the rigorous computational electromagnetics (CEM). The method of moments (MoM) was used to model the mutual coupling among antennas. The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) was applied for the multiple reflections off the ground and walls. The prediction of the field distribution inside such environment is useful for the planning and deployment of a wireless radio and sensor system. Factors that affect the field strengths and distributions of radio waves in confined space were analyzed. The results could be used to evaluate the RF exposure safety in confined environment. By comparing the field distributions for various scenarios, it was observed that the Wi-Fi device counts, spacing and relative locations in the room are important factors in such environments.

Of the 21 aptamers tested, the C(t) values of the SS- 3 and SS- 4 aptamers (Ct = 13. 89 and Ct = 12. 23, respectively) had the lowest value compared to other aptamer candidates. The SS- 3 and SS- 4 aptamers also displayed a binding affinity (KD) of 39. 32 ± 5. 02 nM and 15. 89 ± 1. 77 nM, respectively. An aptamer-based fluorescent biosensor assay was designed to detect and discriminate S. sonnei cells using a sandwich complex pair of SS- 3 and SS- 4. The detection of S. sonnei by the aptamer based fluorescent biosensor platform consisted of three elements: (1) 5 ’amine-SS- 4 modification in a 96 -well type microtiter plate surface (N-oxysuccinimide, NOS) as capture probes; (2) the incubation with S. sonnei and test microbes in functionalized 96 assay wells in parallel; (3) the readout of fluorescent activity using a Cy 5 -labeled SS- 3 aptamer as the detector. Our platform showed a significant ability to detect and discriminate S. sonnei from other enteric species such as E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium and other Shigella species (S. flexneri, S. boydii).

AirFLEX units {{are equipped with}} a supply of extra, full SCBA cylinders and a cascade and compressor for filling SCBA and SCUBA cylinders {{at the scene of}} incidents, as well as basic repair service for SCBA components. AirFLEX can also provide static breathing air via air lines for specialized rescues such as confined space, etc. The second service is floodlight service. Historically, in the fire service, before every front-line apparatus was equipped with power inverters, generators, and scene lighting, stand-alone floodlight units responded to support night-time operations. Original AirFLEX units were equipped with <b>multiple</b> <b>portable</b> floodlight fixtures for such operations, but have adapted to current needs; modern AirFLEX units are equipped with mobile light towers for scene lighting at incidents. The third service is high-expansion foam. Each AirFLEX unit is equipped with a high expansion foam generator, a supply of foam concentrate, and the delivery hose. High-expansion foam is traditionally used for stubborn fires in below-grade or confined environments, where water cannot adequately penetrate, and entry by firefighters is unsafe or unrealistic. In addition to the three [...] "namesake" [...] services, AirFLEX units also provide drinking water for fire scenes, and a supply of freshly charged portable radio batteries for extended incidents. AirFLEX units are staffed by one Emergency Vehicle Driver (or acting EVD). Two front-line AirFLEX units are in service continuously, splitting the city east and west of Charles Street for primary service. An AirFLEX unit is dispatched on working fires, or fires where the Fire Communications Bureau believes that the balance of companies will be utilizing SCBA. An AirFLEX unit is also dispatched automatically on any report of a fire in an ocean-going ship at port, fires below grade (tunnels), and on responses where the SCUBA team is utilized.|$|R

Experimental modal analysis (modal testing) of space structures and launch vehicles has been a requirement for model validation for many years. However, previous testing of solid rocket motors has not typically involved dynamic modal testing of full scale motors for verification of solid propellant or system assembly properties. Innovative approaches to the testing of solid rocket motors were developed and modal testing of a full scale, two segment Titan 34 D Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) was performed to validate detailed computer modeling.

This paper investigates the fairness among <b>multiple</b> Wi-Fi-enabled <b>portable</b> devices in a home network when they are simultaneously communicated with the host machine. First, we present that, a simple IEEE 802. 11 -based home network suffers from unfairness, and the fairness is exaggerated by the wireless link errors.

In this paper we present a system for multiple view reconstruction of dynamic outdoor scenes transferring studio technology to uncontrolled environments. A synchronised <b>portable</b> <b>multiple</b> camera system is composed of off-the-shelf HD cameras for dynamic scene capture.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Occultations {{of stars}} by small {{bodies in the}} outer solar system are {{opportunities}} to make high-resolution measurements of their geometries and orbital elements and to detect or probe their atmospheres. Such events are limited in space and time, so it is desirable to deploy highly capable camera systems on <b>multiple</b> fixed and/or <b>portable</b> telescopes anywhere in the world, potentially on short notice. Similar considerations apply to planetary transits and solar eclipses.

The core of this system is the Andor Technology DV- 887 (now DU- 897) frame-transfer camera, featuring a high frame rate, minimal dead time, high quantum efficiency, and low read noise. An electron-multiplying mode lowers effective read noise to below 1 e pixel 1 and is capable of photon counting.

The proposed design is area, power and design time efficient as compared to conventional SerDes Designs, making it very attractive for modest budget multi-core and multi-processor ASICs with wide communication buses {{that are difficult to}} accommodate within the pin count of commonly available packaging. The design employs a “Statistical Random Sampling Technique ” to observe and adjust the synchronization and serialization signals at start up rather than using a resource-heavy PLL or DLL based frequency multiplier/synthesizer and clock data recovery circuits. The serialization and deserialization logic is based on standard cell technology that makes the design highly <b>portable.</b> <b>Multiple</b> serial lines are bundled with a strobe that is used as a reference signal for deserialization. Data-to-strobe timing skew is compensated by adjusting the launch times of strobe and data symbols at the sender side.

40|$|Colored {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} (CDOM) is often {{an important component of}} the organic carbon pool in river-dominated coastal margins. CDOM directly influences remote sensing applications through its strong absorption in the UV and blue regions of the spectrum. This effect can complicate the use of chlorophyll a retrieval algorithms and phytoplankton production models that are based on remotely sensed ocean color. As freshwater input is the principle source of CDOM in coastal margins, CDOM distribution can often be described by conservative mixing with open ocean waters and may serve as an optical tracer of riverine water. Hence, there is considerable interest in the ability to accurately measure and map CDOM concentrations as well as understand the processes that govern the optical properties and distribution of CDOM in coastal environments. We are examining CDOM dynamics in the waters influenced by the Mississippi River plume. Our program incorporates discrete samples, flow-through measurements, and remote sensing.
