The ET-MP allows soldiers to choose between fragmentation and blast overpressure effects by flipping a switch. It also has improved safety, being the first Insensitive Munitions-qualified lethal grenade in the Army’s portfolio with an electronic fuse, or delay mechanism, instead of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> that can be narrowed down into milliseconds and, until armed, {{will not be able to}} detonate. The grenade is designed for ambidextrous use, so the same arming procedure is used for either hand, whereas the M67 required a different procedure for left-handed use. Research for the ET-MP grenade began in 2010, with entry expected in 2020.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) {{reinforced}} by continuous fibers, a good toughness {{is achieved by}} adding a thin film called "interphase" between the fiber and the brittle matrix, which acts as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> by deflecting the matrix cracks. Pyrocarbon (PyC), with or without carbide sub-layers, is typically the material of choice to fulfill this role. The aim of this work was to study PyC-free nanoscale multilayered carbide coatings as interphases for CMCs. Nanoscale multilayered (SiC-TiC) n interphases were deposited by pressure-Pulsed Chemical Vapor Deposition (P-CVD) on single filament Hi-Nicalon fibers and embedded in a SiC matrix sheath. The thicknesses of the carbide interphase sub-layers could be made as low as a few nanometers as evidenced by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. By using the P-ReactiveCVD method (P-RCVD), in which the TiC growth involves consumption of SiC, {{it was not only}} possible to obtain multilayered (SiC-TiC) n films but also TiC films with a porous multilayered microstructure {{as a result of the}} Kirkendall effect. The porosity in the TiC sequences was found to be enhanced when some PyC was added to SiC prior to total RCVD consumption. Because the porosity volume fraction was still not high enough, the role of <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> of the interphases could not be evidenced from the tensile curves, which remained fully linear even when chemical attack of the fiber surface was avoided...|$|E

40|$|NiTiNOL is {{best known}} for its ability to {{remember}} a preset shape, even after being 'plastically' deformed. This is accomplished by heating the material to an elevated temperature up to 120 degrees C. However, NiTiNOL has other material and mechanical properties that provide a novel method of structural release. This combination of properties allows NiTiNOL {{to be used as a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> between structural components. When electrical power is applied to the NiTiNOL fuse(s), the material is annealed reducing the mechanical strength to a small fraction of the as-wrought material. The preload then fractures the weakened NiTiNOL fuse(s) and releases the structure. This paper describes the mechanical characteristics of the NiTiNOL allow used in this invention, structural separation design concepts using the NiTiNOL material, and initial test data.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the interfaces in carbon fiber (high resistance Toray T 800) reinforced aluminium matrix composites, a pyrolytic carbon (Cp) layer has been developed by a CVD process using a hot wall reactor operating at reduced pressure. The Cp, which has a weak shear strength, is introduced to promote adequate debonding at the fiber/matrix interface. In a first step, classical CVD studies are conducted on planar carbon substrates with a parametric investigation {{of the effects of}} temperature, pressure, reactant flow rates on the growth rate and morphology of the coating. For Cp, obtained form thennal decomposition of ethylene, a very high activation energy (310 kJ/mol) and a decrease in coating growth rate with the reactant residence time indicate that the reaction limiting step occurs in the gaseous phase. The carbon coatings exhibit a macroscopic stratified morphology which could promote internal delamination. In a second step, deposition parameters have been optimized to ensure a good infiltration of 6000 filaments yarns. Finally, the influence of carbon underlayer on the mechanical properties of coated fibers is determined by tensile tests on monofilaments and interpreted in terms of Weibull distribution. The results on aluminium composites confirm the beneficial role of <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> played by the Cp coating. 1...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid polymer-network gels {{built by}} both {{physical}} and covalent polymer crosslinking combine the advantages of both these crosslinking types: they exhibit high mechanical strength along with excellent fracture toughness and extensibility. If these materials are extensively deformed, their physical crosslinks can break such that strain energy is dissipated and irreversible fracturing is restricted to high strain only. This mechanism of energy dissipation {{is determined by the}} kinetics and thermodynamics of the physical crosslinking contribution. In this paper, we present a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based material toolkit to control these contributions in a rational and custom fashion. We form well-defined covalent polymer-network gels with regularly distributed additional supramolecular <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse</b> links, whose strength of connectivity can be tuned without affecting the primary polymer-network composition. This is possible because the supramolecular fuse links are based on terpyridine–metal complexation, such that the mere choice of the fuse-linking metal ion adjusts their kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation–decomplexation, which directly affects the mechanical properties of the hybrid gels. We use oscillatory shear rheology to demonstrate this rational control and enhancement of the mechanical properties of the hybrid gels. In addition, static light scattering reveals their highly regular and well-defined polymer-network structures. As a result of both, the present approach provides an easy and reliable concept for preparing hybrid polymer-network gels with rationally designed properties...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} able to alter their {{morphology}} under stressful hydrodynamic conditions to improve survival and growth; adjustments can include increases in below ground ‘anchoring’ biomass, or escape strategies such as extending the internodal length of rhizomes. Whilst research has demonstrated how macrophytes respond morphologically to stressful hydraulic conditions, {{there is little evidence}} of how these changes, particularly in below ground size and structure, influence the forces required to damage and dislodge aquatic plants. The aim of our study was to further establish the links between mechanical force (i. e. the forces required to uproot plants or cause stem breakage) and plant morphology in the common and widely distributed emergent species Sparganium erectum. Mechanical force was applied using a pulling device that consisted of a winch mounted on a metal frame that sat on the river bank, and from which a cable, with attached load cell, was connected to the stem of a S. erectum plant. We found strong associations between the below ground structures of the plant and the force at which it experiences failure. Below ground plant organs were important in determining the overall resilience of this species, with root length showing the strongest association with its ability to resist uprooting, whilst rhizomes had the longest seasonal influence on the force required to uproot the plant. Biomass measurements of below ground organs revealed rapid increases in root biomass early in the season, in contrast to the rhizome and corm biomass, which peaked {{at the end of the}} growth season. We argue that these results are demonstrative of a number of biomechanical and morphological traits that contribute to the pervasiveness of the species, its management challenges, and its function as an ecosystem engineer, whereby it alters the physical structure of river channels by deflecting flow and building large sediment accumulations. These traits include the presence of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuse,</b> rapid growth of roots early in the season and reproductive structures at the end of the season, which probably have a reinforcing effect on the surrounding sediment, and the high resistance of the species to uprooting, stem and rhizome breakag...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{plastic hinge}} {{is a type}} of energy {{dampening}} device allowing plastic rotation of an otherwise rigid column connection. This device is composed of a weakened portion of the column prevented from rotating by relatively small steel members. These small bars are designed to yield and allow rotation before the capacity of the column is reached, thus acting as <b>mechanical</b> <b>fuses</b> protecting the column from fatigue. After a seismic event the fuse bars can be easily replaced, restoring the column to its original condition. To function properly the hinge must become plastic before the column above it yields, but limiting the deflection {{at the top of the}} column is also desirable for the stability of the overlying structure, necessitating a hinge with some degree of strength. The experimental setup of this study was constructed in the University at Buffalo’s Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory in 2004 and was comprised of a steel column subjected to lateral displacement at the top with a plastic hinge fixed at the base, simulating earthquake-induced ground motion on a bridge column. The purpose of this research was to develop an accurate model of the column-hinge system in the elastic range of the fuse bars, allowing consideration of the above design criteria for later testing.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>fuses</b> {{usually do}} not provide high {{performance}} {{in the process of}} destruction of such objects as the armored vehicles. Shaped and armor-piercing high-explosive shells have a heading part of low strength. This prevents from achieving a required level of contact force (reaction or inertia), which is necessary for reliable operation of the target sensor. At the same time, electromechanical fuses have higher sensitivity and operating speed rates being capable of adaptive response to the conditions of shell encountering with the target. A generalized block diagram of the fuse is analysed, and a mathematical model of the piezoelectric transducer (PT) as a sensing element of the fuse contact sensor target (CST) is proposed. The model takes into account the empirical dependence of the relative permittivity of piezoelectric ceramics on the electric field. An approximate method of calculating the response of PT is presented. It is oriented at evaluating the propagation of a short stress pulse of high intensity, the geometric length of which is commensurate with the length of the piezoelectric element (PE). In this case significantly increases the role of wave processes in the ammunition shell and the PT itself. The calculation is based {{on the use of the}} concept of equivalent stress, which is obtained by averaging its diagrams at each time point along the PE. The method allows to analyze the sequence of loading phases passing through the PE body, which depends on the ratio of said geometrical parameters and quantitative characteristics of the output electrical signal of the transducer. An example of estimating the performance of a real piezoelectric CTS is presented. The experimentally obtained force characteristic of the head of piezoelectric fuse is taken into account as well as the encountering speed of the shell and the threshold operating level of the firing train actuator.
