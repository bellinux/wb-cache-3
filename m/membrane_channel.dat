40|$|We {{introduce}} a Markov {{model for the}} gating of <b>membrane</b> <b>channels.</b> The model features a possible solution to the so-called gating current paradox, namely that the bell-shaped curve that describes the voltage dependence of the kinetics is broader than expected from, and shifted relative to, the sigmoidal curve that describes the voltage dependence of the activation. The model also predicts some temperature dependence of this shift, but presence of the latter has not been tested experimentally so far. INTRODUCTION The gating of <b>membrane</b> <b>channels</b> is of vital importance for the electrophysiological activity of nerve, heart, and muscle. While some of these channels appear to have fractal-like gating (Liebovitch, 1995), most <b>membrane</b> <b>channels</b> do display activity that can be well approximated by a simple Markov process (Korn and Horn, 1988).

50|$|The C-terminal {{domain of}} the adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT or CyaA; TC# 1.C.11.1.4) of Bordetella {{pertussis}} forms a small cation-selective channel, disrupting the permeability barrier. This channel probably delivers the N-terminal adenylate cyclase to the host cell cytoplasm. Mutations in residues in an amphipathic α-helix (Glu509 and Glu516) in the pore-forming domain block adenylate cyclase translocation and modulate cation selectivity of the <b>membrane</b> <b>channel.</b> ACT does not use a protein receptor and inserts into liposomes. Phosphatidylethanolamine and cholesterol stimulate ACT insertion.

BCL-2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic {{regulators}} {{that are involved in}} a wide variety of cellular activities. The proteins encoded by this gene are located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, and have been shown to regulate outer mitochondrial <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> (VDAC) opening. VDAC regulates mitochondrial membrane potential, and thus controls the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of cytochrome C by mitochondria, both of which are the potent inducers of cell apoptosis. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported. The longer isoform (Bcl-xL) acts as an apoptotic inhibitor and the shorter form (Bcl-xS) acts as an apoptotic activator.|$|E
50|$|Connexon {{structure}} is degraded by its removal from the plasma membrane. Connexons will be internalized by the cell {{itself as a}} double <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> structure (due to the docking of hemi-channels). This is called internalization or endocytosis. Research suggests that gap junctions in general may be internalized using more than one method, but the best known and most studied would be that of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In simple terms this process consists of a ligand binding to a receptor signaling for a certain part of the membrane to be coated in clathrin. This part of the membrane then buds into the cell forming a vesicle. Now present in the cell membrane, connexons will be degraded by lysosomal pathways. Lysosomes are able {{to break down the}} proteins of the connexon because they contain specific enzymes that are made specifically for this process.

5000|$|Maltoporins (or LamB porins) are {{a family}} of outer {{membrane}} proteins. Maltoporin forms a trimeric structure which facilitates the diffusion of maltodextrins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> is formed by an antiparallel beta-barrel.Maltoporin is a trimeric channel on the bacterial outer membrane. Most pores used for diffusion contain only 16 antiparallel strands, but Maltoporin has 18. The structure of Maltoporin contains long loops and short turns. The long loops are {{in contact with the}} cell exterior and the turns are in contact with the periplasm. This channel is involved in sugar transport. The sugar initially binds to the first greasy residue with van der Waals forces. The sugar continues through the channel by guided diffusion of the sugar along the greasy residues which form a [...] "slide". Maltoporin's original name was LamB because it is a bacteriophage lambda receptor. This channel is specific because it has a binding site for maltosaccharides. The affinity of these maltosaccharides to the channel increases as the length of the chain increases.|$|E
50|$|RND {{proteins}} {{are large}} and can include more than 1000 amino acid residues. They are generally composed of two homologous subunits (suggesting they arose {{as a result of}} an intragenic tandem duplication event that occurred in the primordial system prior to divergence of the family members) each containing a periplasmic loop adjacent to 12 transmembrane helices. Of the twelve helices there is a single transmembrane spanner (TMS) at the N-terminus followed by a large extracytoplasmic domain, then six additional TMSs, a second large extracytoplasmic domain, and five final C-terminal TMSs. TM4 governs the specificity for a particular substrate in a given RND protein. Therefore, TM4 can be an indicator for RND specificity without explicit knowledge of the remainder of the protein.RND pumps are the cytoplasmic residing portion of a complete tripartite complex (Fig. 1) which spreads across the outer-membrane and the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria, also commonly referred to as the CBA efflux system. The RND protein associates with an outer <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> and a periplasmic adaptor protein, and the association of all three proteins allows the system to export substrates into the external medium, providing a huge advantage for the bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Exclusion Argument: He {{challenged}} the Exclusion Argument (EA) of Jaegwon Kim, {{according to which}} causal efficacy resides solely in the physical domain of the rootmost level of energy, by arguing that the EA does not hold if indeterminism is the case. This, he argues, provides an opening for information to be downwardly causal in the universe, whether high-level supervenient events such as conscious percepts or a concept, {{such as that of}} a ‘home-run’ in a baseball game, or ‘voting’ in a democracy. Information is downwardly causal, not as a force, he argues, but by filtering out possible paths that are open at the particle level which are not consistent with informational criteria. Under ‘criterial causation’ (see below) only physically causal paths which are also informational causal paths are permitted to occur in the nervous system and other information processing systems, such as underlie genetic inheritance, protein formation, <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> formation, or social interactions such as speaking or institutional interactions. Possible physical particle-level paths which do not meet high-level informational criteria are effectively filtered out by a criterial assessment. Thus information is causal, not as a force, or via attributes such as impact or force, but is causal as a filter on what possibilities can become real.|$|E

50|$|It was {{initially}} hypothesized that general anaesthetic binds to its target ion channel by a key-lock mechanism and changes its structure dramatically from open to closed conformation or vice versa. However, {{there is a}} significant amount of evidence against direct key-lock interaction of membrane proteins with general anaesthetics Various studies have shown that low affinity drugs including inhaled general anaesthetics do not usually interact with their target proteins via specific lock-and-key binding mechanism because they do not change molecular structures of transmembrane receptors, ion channels and globular proteins. Based on these experimental facts and some computer simulations modern version of protein hypothesis was proposed. Proteins of four-α-helix bundle structural motif served as models of monomer of pentameric Cys-loop receptor because binding pockets of inhaled anaesthetics are believed to be within transmembrane four-α-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors. Inhaled general anaesthetic does not change structure of <b>membrane</b> <b>channel</b> but changes its dynamics especially dynamics in the flexible loops that connect α-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface. It is a well known fact that dynamics of protein in microsecond-millisecond timescale is often coupled with functions of the protein. Thus it was logical to propose that since inhaled general anaesthetics do not change protein structure they may exert their effect on proteins by modulating protein dynamics in a slow microsecond-millisecond timescale and/or by disrupting the modes of motion essential for function of this protein. Normal interactions between residues in protein regions (loops) at the water-lipid interface that play critical roles in protein functions and agonist binding may be disrupted by general anaesthetic. Interactions within the same loop or between different loops may be disrupted by anaesthetics and ultimately functions of Cys-loop receptors may be altered.|$|E
