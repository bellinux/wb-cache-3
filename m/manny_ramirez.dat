5|$|In late July, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> {{was traded}} {{away by the}} Red Sox. Youkilis took over the cleanup spot of the lineup.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox {{lost their}} first-round pick in 2001 to the Cleveland Indians as {{compensation}} for signing free agent <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{winners of}} the award were <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> and Sammy Sosa in 1999, while the most recent winners are Jose Altuve and Giancarlo Stanton. Alex Rodriguez has won the award four times, {{the most of any}} player. The winner with the most hits is Todd Helton, who won as a Colorado Rockies in 2000. The winner with the most home runs is Barry Bonds from 2001, and <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez</b> in 1999 has the most RBIs.|$|E
50|$|He is {{also known}} for giving up <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez's</b> first career home run.|$|R
5000|$|Hit 19 grand slams (fourth all-time, behind Lou Gehrig's 23, Alex Rodriguez's 25, and <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez's</b> 21).|$|R
50|$|After the 2008 season, Schilling {{released}} a blog post blasting former-Red Sox teammate <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> conduct before Ramirez left the team.|$|R
5|$|None of the Indians' first-round picks {{have won}} a World Series {{championship}} with the team, and no pick has been elected to the Hall of Fame. None of these picks have won the MLB Rookie of the Year award, although <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> (1991) placed second in the voting in 1994. CC Sabathia (1998) is the only first-round pick of the Indians to earn a Cy Young Award with the team, winning in 2007. The Indians have never held the first overall pick in the draft, but have selected players with the second overall pick five times.|$|E
5|$|With {{one year}} {{remaining}} until {{he would become}} eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. Alex Rodriguez had signed a ten-year, $252million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9million average annual value of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2million) and <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> ($20million).|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to build up their lineup, the Red Sox set up a {{potential}} deal that would send reigning AL MVP Alex Rodriguez to Boston and Red Sox <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez</b> and other players to Texas. The deal eventually fell through after Rodríguez indicated he would not go against the MLBPA, which opposes a proposed renegotiation, which would have potentially reduced Rodríguez's earnings in the later years of his contract. A freak off-season basketball injury to Aaron Boone just several months removed from his historic home run had Yankees management looking at possible options to replace him. Despite being courted by Boston for nearly three months, Rodríguez was traded from Texas to New York.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, 2008, Boras {{negotiated}} {{away the}} option years on <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> {{contract with the}} Boston Red Sox as part of Ramirez's trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers, making Ramirez {{a free agent after}} the 2008 season, two years early.|$|R
25|$|On December 5, 2010 Boras {{negotiated}} a seven-year, $126 million contract for Jayson Werth with the Washington Nationals, {{only three months}} after Werth hired him. The contract tied for the third largest in baseball history for an outfielder, trailing only <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> contract with the Boston Red Sox and Alfonso Soriano's contract with the Chicago Cubs.|$|R
5000|$|Victor Jacobs (born December 12, 1952), {{also known}} as Vic [...] "The Brick" [...] Jacobs, is an American radio and {{television}} sportscaster. He {{is best known as}} a former co-host of The Loose Cannons, a sports radio talk airing nationally on Fox Sports Radio. He is known for eccentric behavior, like wearing fur caps and robes, and writing Lakers haiku poems to read on-air. During <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> time as a Dodger, Jacobs created a nickname for Ramirez, [...] "El Maniaco".|$|R
5|$|Tim Wakefield {{made his}} first start of the 2004 postseason for the Red Sox, {{becoming}} the first knuckleball pitcher to make a World Series start since 1948, while Woody Williams, who had won both his previous two starts in the post-season, was the Cardinals' starting pitcher. In {{the bottom of the}} first inning, Williams gave up a lead-off double to Johnny Damon, and then hit Orlando Cabrera in the shoulder with one of his pitches. After <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez</b> flied out, Ortiz hit a three-run home run in his first-ever World Series at bat. Kevin Millar then scored by virtue of a single by Bill Mueller to put the Red Sox up 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Among outfielders {{and among}} all Silver Slugger winners, Barry Bonds {{has won the}} most awards, winning twelve times between 1990 and 2004. All of his awards were won in the National League. <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> leads the American League with eight wins. Ken Griffey, Jr., Vladimir Guerrero, and Tony Gwynn have each won seven Silver Sluggers in the outfield; Juan González, Kirby Puckett, and Sammy Sosa have won six times. Two players have won five times (Albert Belle and Dave Winfield), and four-time winners include Andre Dawson, Matt Holliday, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, and Ryan Braun. There have also been 7 three-time outfield winners and 18 two-time awardees. The most recent winners are Ryan Braun, Matt Kemp, and Justin Upton in the National League, and José Bautista, Curtis Granderson, and Jacoby Ellsbury in the American League.|$|E
5|$|With the win coming {{eight months}} after the New England Patriots victory in Super Bowl XXXVIII, the event made Boston the first city to have a Super Bowl and World Series winner in the same year since Pittsburgh in 1979. A number of players from both teams won awards for their {{performances}} during the season. <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez</b> won the Hank Aaron Award and, along with Albert Pujols, a Silver Slugger Award, while Gold Glove awards were won by Mike Matheny, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds. The American sports magazine Sports Illustrated honored the Red Sox with their Sportsman of the Year award a month later, making them the first professional team to ever win the award. For pitcher Curt Schilling, it was the second time he had won the award, having shared it with then-Arizona Diamondbacks teammate Randy Johnson in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Rookie Dustin Pedroia led off the Sox' {{first inning}} {{with a home}} run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park off of Jeff Francis. Pedroia's homer was only the second lead-off home run to start a World Series; (the only other one was hit by Baltimore's Don Buford in 1969). Kevin Youkilis then doubled to right, moved to third on David Ortiz's groundout, and scored on <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> single. After Mike Lowell flew out, Jason Varitek singled before J. D. Drew doubled to score Ramirez and make it 3-0 Red Sox.|$|R
50|$|Ogea, {{having lost}} {{two games in}} the ALCS and winning no games in June, July, or August, managed to win two World Series games, both of them against Marlins ace Kevin Brown. In that Series, he gave up just two earned runs for an ERA of 1.54. Batting in Game 6 against Brown, Ogea managed to get his first hit since high school, {{knocking}} in two runs in the process. Later, he hit a double to lead off the 5th inning. He would score on <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez's</b> sacrifice fly. He became the first pitcher since Mickey Lolich to drive in two World Series runs and the first Cleveland Indians pitcher to drive in a World Series run since 1920.|$|R
50|$|The Yankees {{loaded the}} {{bases in the}} second off of Derek Lowe on two walks and a hit when Karim Garcia's single scored two, then Alfonso Soriano's single scored another. <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> leadoff {{home run in the}} fourth off of David Wells made it 3-1 Yankees. They made it 4-1 in the eighth when Bernie Williams reached on a force out at second, moved to third on Jorge Posada's single and scored on Hideki Matsui's groundout off of Alan Embree. In the bottom of the inning, Todd Walker hit a leadoff triple off of Mariano Rivera and scored on Nomar Garciaparra's groundout to make it 4-2 Yankees. Rivera, though, shut out the Red Sox {{for the rest of the}} game, leaving the Yankees one win away from the World Series.|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez,</b> J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three-run deficit and completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XLVIII, Manning's Broncos {{lost to the}} Seattle Seahawks by a {{score of}} 43–8. Manning was up against the Seahawks' young {{starting}} quarterback Russell Wilson, who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning's passing camps as a teenager, and later met Manning at a Broncos pre-draft interview. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved {{too much for the}} Broncos' number one ranked offense to overcome, while the Broncos' defense also struggled due to injuries. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage {{set the tone for the}} game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> snapped the ball too early and it flew past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX), but the record-setting offense did not record a first down until the second quarter, and did not score any points until the final seconds of the third quarter. While Manning threw one touchdown pass and one successful two-point conversion, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Of these 27 players, 14 were {{right-handed}} batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are {{the only}} franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Williams, and more recently <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> and David Ortiz. Five 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, {{the first time that}} a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz, who hit his 500th home run on September 12, 2015. As of the end of the 2017 Major League Baseball season, Albert Pujols is the only active member of the 500 home run club.|$|E
5000|$|This back-and-forth World Series {{continued}} {{that way}} in Game 4. Both teams were greeted by snow during batting practice and freezing temperatures throughout this contest. The official gametime temperature of 38 °F (3.3 °C) remains [...] the coldest recorded in World Series history, while as the game progressed media outlets reported wind chill readings as low as 18 °F (-7.8 °C). Two rookies opposed {{each other on the}} mound this night; Jaret Wright for the Indians and Tony Saunders for the Marlins. The Indians stormed out of the gate with three runs in the first, highlighted by <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez's</b> opposite field two-run homer. The Indians got three runs in the third inning as well and never looked back. Matt Williams {{turned out to be the}} offensive hero by reaching base six times, which included a two-run blast in the eighth to close the scoring.|$|R
5000|$|Hack Wilson set {{a record}} of 56 home-runs and 190 runs-batted-in in 1930, {{breaking}} Lou Gehrig's MLB record of 176 RBI. (In 1999, a long-lost extra RBI mistakenly credited to Charlie Grimm had been found by Cooperstown researcher Cliff Kachline and verified by historian Jerome Holtzman, increasing the record number to 191.) As of 2014 the record still stands, with no serious threats coming since Gehrig (184) and Hank Greenberg (183) in the same era. The closest anyone {{has come to the}} mark in the last 75 years was <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> 165 RBI in 1999. [...] In addition to the RBI record, Wilson 56 home-runs stood as the National League record until 1998, when Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire hit 66 and 70, respectively. Wilson was named [...] "Most Useful" [...] player that year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, as the official N.L. Most Valuable Player Award was not awarded until the next season.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the final}} day of the season, after bunting for a single in his first at bat in the first inning, Reyes asked his manager to remove him from the game, ending his season with a [...]337 batting average, two points ahead of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers in the race for the NL batting title. Braun went 0-4 later in the day to finish at [...]332. Reyes became the first Met in {{franchise}} history to win an NL batting title. Reyes's decision came on the 70th anniversary of Ted Williams' refusal sit out a doubleheader on the last day of the 1941 season, putting his [...]400 batting average at risk but ultimately hitting 6-for-8 and raising his average from [...]39955 to [...]406. Reyes played in 126 games in 2011, the fewest games played by a batting champion since <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> 120 games played in 2002. He became a free agent at the end of the season.|$|R
25|$|In February 2009, Boras {{secured a}} two-year, $45 million deal for <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> with the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} five other players in history who have both hit more {{home runs and}} have a higher career batting average than Thomas: Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Babe Ruth, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez,</b> and Willie Mays.|$|E
25|$|Of note, {{three of}} the players who were on this winless season roster went on to {{participate}} in Super Bowl XLVIII: <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> and Paris Lenon for the Denver Broncos and Cliff Avril for the eventual champion Seattle Seahawks.|$|E
50|$|After {{the wall}} was painted green in 1947, {{advertisements}} did not appear on the wall until 1999, when the All-Star Game at Fenway was being promoted. Various ads have appeared above the scoreboard since then, such as the Jimmy Fund, W.B. Mason, and Granite City Electric. The Coke Bottles on the left light tower were a target for power-hitters when they were placed in 1997. These 3D advertisements were taken down before the 2008 season, when an LED sign was built above the new left-field upper deck seats. As a lead up to his 500th career home run, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> home run count was tallied {{on the bottom of}} the light tower. Ads beside the manual scoreboard were added when the scoreboard was expanded. Above the manual scoreboard, where a Jimmy Fund advertisement had remained for many years, the logo for Covidien is now a prominent aspect of Fenway Park. Outside of Fenway in Kenmore Square, but able to be seen in the view above the left-field wall, is the Boston Citgo sign.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the first, Clemens allowed a leadoff single to Johnny Damon and {{subsequent}} double to Todd Walker. After Nomar Garciaparra struck out, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> double put the Red Sox up 2-0. The Yankees cut it to 2-1 in the second off of Martinez when Jorge Posada hit a leadoff double and scored on Karim Garcia's single two outs later. Derek Jeter's home run next inning tied the game. In the fourth, Posada drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Nick Johnson's single, and scored on Hideki Matsui's ground-rule double. After Garcia was hit by a pitch to load the bases, Alfonso Soriano hit into a double play that scored Johnson and put the Yankees up 4-2. In {{the bottom of}} the seventh, reliever Félix Heredia issued a leadoff walk to David Ortiz. Jose Contreras relieved Heredia and allowed a single to Kevin Millar that moved Ortiz to third. Ortiz scored when Trot Nixon hit into a double play to make it 4-3 Yankees. Their lead held, though, putting them up 2-1 in the series.|$|R
50|$|The Athletics struck {{first in}} Game 5 {{in the fourth}} off of Pedro Martinez when Scott Hatteberg walked with two outs and scored on Jose Guillen's double, but Jason Varitek's lead-off {{home run in the}} sixth tied the game off of Barry Zito. Following a walk and hit-by-pitch, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> three-run home run put the Red Sox up 4-1. The Athletics cut it to 4-2 {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Erubiel Durazo doubled with one out and scored on Miguel Tejada's double one out later. They cut it to 4-3 when Chris Singleton hit a leadoff double off of Martinez and scored on Billy McMillon's single in the eighth. The A's loaded the bases on three walks in the ninth inning, but {{temporary}} closer Derek Lowe struck out Terrence Long looking to end the game. The win was marred by a violent collision between outfielder Johnny Damon and second baseman Damian Jackson. Damon was sent to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion. Boston's victory secured their place in the American League Championship Series while Oakland lost the ALDS after being up two games to none for the second time in three years.|$|R
25|$|Sabathia was {{sixth in}} the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols of the Cardinals, Ryan Howard of the Phillies, Ryan Braun also of the Brewers, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> of the Dodgers, and Lance Berkman of the Astros.|$|E
25|$|The Red Sox {{caught the}} Tampa Bay Rays {{during the summer}} as the Rays began to decline slightly. While the pennant race caught fire, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> did not {{want any part of}} it since the Red Sox did not offer him a {{sufficient}} contract for the 2009 season. As a result, <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way trade involving the Pittsburgh Pirates. The trade brought Jason Bay to the Red Sox. In September, the Rays held on to win the Eastern Division title with a 97–65 record. As for Boston, they won 95 games with a Wildcard berth. After defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS once again, they lost to the Rays in a seven-game ALCS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Manny</b> <b>Ramírez</b> {{was named}} World Series MVP. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's {{championship}} season, {{on the night}} of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium. The Red Sox won the title about eleven minutes before totality ended.|$|E
2500|$|June {{began with}} a {{pitchers}} duel between John Ely and Dan Haren. The game was scoreless through nine innings and the Dodgers finally won the game 1–0 on a walk-off home run by Matt Kemp {{in the bottom of}} the 10th. The following day, the Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 1–0 in 14 innings. Travis Schlichting pitched four scoreless innings of relief for his first Major League victory. Garret Anderson's walk-off single capped the Dodgers third straight victory in their last at-bat. The Dodgers brief winning streak ended when they fell 4–3 to the Atlanta Braves the following day. James Loney's tie-breaking RBI single off Braves reliever Eric O'Flaherty helped the Dodgers win the second game of the series, 5–4, and end the Braves nine-game winning streak. In the third game the Braves scored seven runs in the seventh inning to rout the Dodgers 9–3. The series ended with a split when the Dodgers won the finale on a walk-off single by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning for a 5–4 victory. Blake DeWitt's career high five RBIs powered the Dodgers to a lopsided 12–4 victory in the opener of [...] a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 7. <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> RBI double ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the series}} shifted to Fenway Park, {{so did the}} momentum. The Indians, too, would lose a {{starting}} pitcher to injury and blow a lead in Game 3. They struck first on a David Justice sacrifice fly fly off Ramón Martínez in the fourth, but, after shutting out the Red Sox for four innings, starting pitcher Dave Burba left with a strained forearm. Mike Hargrove chose to insert presumed Game 4 starter Jaret Wright instead of rookie middle reliever Sean DePaula. The Red Sox quickly took the lead off Wright in the fifth on a Darren Lewis single and Trot Nixon sacrifice fly. Harold Baines's force out with runners on the corners tied {{the game in the}} sixth for the Indians. A lead-off home run by John Valentin untied the score for the Red Sox {{in the bottom of the}} sixth, but his error on <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez's</b> groundout with runners on first and third tied it back 3-3 in the top of the seventh. After Wright walked Merloni and hit Jason Varitek, Ricardo Rincón came on and got two outs, then Offerman walked to load the bases, John Valentin became the hero again with a double that scored Varitek and Lewis. Brian Daubach then hit a three-run home run to make it 8-3 Red Sox. Sean DePaula relieved Rincon and allowed a walk and single before Lou Merloni's RBI single made it 9-3 Red Sox. Derek Lowe earned the win 2 1/3 innings of relief while Rod Beck pitched a scoreless ninth to seal the Red Sox's win.|$|R
25|$|During {{his time}} in the Braves' minor league system, Jones was {{involved}} in a bench clearing brawl with future Major League stars <b>Manny</b> <b>Ramirez</b> and Jim Thome. Thome and Jones would eventually go on to develop a good friendship over the years. He also changed his position from shortstop to third base, following the guidance of the Braves organization.|$|E
