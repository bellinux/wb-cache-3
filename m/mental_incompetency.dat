Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing {{she has a}} hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a taser, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo {{on his chest and}} stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.|$|E

5000|$|A false {{confession}} is {{an admission}} of guilt for a crime for which the confessor is not responsible. False confessions can be induced through coercion or by the <b>mental</b> disorder or <b>incompetency</b> of the accused. Research demonstrates that false confessions occur {{on a regular basis}} in case law, which is one reason why jurisprudence has established a series of rules—called [...] "confession rules"—to detect, and subsequently reject, false confessions. Plea agreements typically require the defendant to stipulate to a set of facts establishing that he/she is guilty of the offense; in the United States federal system, before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.|$|R

Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials. The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that 'brainwashing' or 'mind control' has been used, in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violated.|$|E

It provides for closed hearings and trials in connection with sterilization orders, {{the addition of a}} psychiatrist or psychologist on the examining team to determine whether a person is mentally incompetent, the requirement that the examining team consider the feasibility of alternate methods of birth control rather than sterilization and a deletion of governmental agencies from those authorized to file <b>mental</b> <b>incompetency</b> petitions...|$|E
40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{numbers and}} relative proportion of elderly in the population, physicians are now frequently facing the {{difficult task of}} determining the financial competence of vulnerable individuals. The determination of financial competence in the elderly is still a very poorly defined issue. In this paper an attempt is made to clarify the existing law and the physician's legal obligations. The Mental Health Act, Powers of Attorney Act and <b>Mental</b> <b>Incompetency</b> Act, as they relate to a patient's financial competence, are reviewed. The difficulties in the clinical application of these laws are illustrated by two reports of patients referred to the geriatric psychiatry service of Sunnybrook Medical Centre, University of Toronto. Some general principles and practical guidelines are proposed to help physicians deal more effectively with this issue...|$|E
40|$|HB 889 amends Title 37 of the Georgia Code by {{changing}} several provisions relating to administration {{of mental health}} laws. The most significant changes include providing the Department of Human Resources with access to patient records, changing {{the duties of the}} chief medical officer, allowing chief medical officers to appoint designees, changing the provision regarding patient discharge, and allowing psychologists to perform functions traditionally performed by physicians. Other minor changes include providing for confidentiality of records and providing patients with the ability to seek treatment from private psychologists. HB 469 provides the court with authority to authorize a period of conditional release for mental patients who plead insanity or <b>mental</b> <b>incompetency.</b> During this period of conditional release, the court monitors the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s progress in society and has the authority to revoke the conditional release period if warranted...|$|E
40|$|Court {{records of}} <b>mental</b> <b>incompetency</b> {{proceedings}} for {{a five-year period}} from a single county were analyzed to determine (1) the extent of actual involvement {{of the legal system}} in the cases, and (2) whether the adjudication was correlated with the legal variables and with two characteristics of the examining physicians. It was con-cluded that the legal system is only peripherally involved in incompetency cases and that the decisions, rather than being objective medical decisions, were correlated with a number of non-medical factors, including the legal variables and the amount of experience of the examining physicians in these types of cases. Involuntary commitment has wide ramifications for both the individual and the society. For the individual judged incompetent it includes incarcer-ation and stigma; for the society it in-volves judging and labelling individ-uals believed to be mentally ill, and thus can be instrumental in the stabili-zation of this type of deviant behavior. Incompetency proceedings are pres-ently structured to include both the legal and the medical institutions. How-ever, the values and assumptions of these two institutions relating to in-competency are generally in conflict. The legal profession is committed to the assumption that one is innocent until proven guilty; the medical pro-fession, on the other hand, seems to take the position that it is safer to assume illness rather than its absence. The law is concerned with protecting individual rights; the medical profes-sion is concerned with providing proper treatment with as little trauma as pos-sible. However, actual conflict between these two systems has been minimal since in practice the determination of mental illness has been treated almost exclusively as a medical decision. It has been suggested that (1) the courts seldom disagree with the examining committee's recommendation, (2) le-* We gratefully acknowledge the com-ments of Wiley P.

40|$|During {{the late}} thirteenth century the English Crown claimed {{the right to}} take the lands of {{so-called}} idiots into its possession, and developed a set of juridical practices to assess whether these individuals were mentally competent enough to rule themselves and their property. This dissertation examines how these developments informed the way society imagined intellectual disability in the Middle Ages and beyond. Since the publication of Foucault's Madness and Civilization, scholars have treated insanity as a concept with a cultural history. Less however {{has been written about the}} conceptual history of "idiocy. " People outside the academy naturally assume that intelligence and its absence are natural categories, while historians who work on the cultural history of intellectual disability tend to locate its emergence in early modern medical discourses. Rejecting both of these claims, Inventing Idiocy suggests that intellectual disability was not initially a medical concept, but an invention of medieval jurists and administrators concerned with practical matters of land and inheritance. For while a concept of idiocy existed in the Middle Ages, the idiocy that preoccupied medieval jurists had little to do with a specific idea of intelligence. Rather it was a narrow legal term, used to refer to people who were unable to manage landed wealth. People outside the legal profession had little idea what idiocy entailed, and no disorder resembling the law's idea of idiocy-or our own-existed in medieval medicine. Nevertheless hundreds of alleged idiots were called before the courts between the late thirteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Examining records of these inquisitions, I show that qualities associated with idiocy in later medical discourses reflected the idea of <b>mental</b> <b>incompetency</b> that arose in of these contested trials. In doing so, I reject the view that intellectual disability originated when medical discourse supplanted older religious constructions of foolishness, and is indeed medical in origin. Instead, I suggest that a stable and distinctive concept of intellectual disability entered Western thought when a category invented by lawyers to deal with practical problems of inheritance burgeoned beyond the legal sphere, and became assimilated into general culture. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E
