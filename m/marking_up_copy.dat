50|$|The major {{advancement}} {{presented by}} the phototypesetting machines over the Linotype machine hot-type machines was the elimination of metal type, an intermediate step no longer required once offset printing became the norm. This cold-type technology {{could also be used}} in office environments where hot-metal machines (the Mergenthaler Linotype, the Harris Intertype and the Monotype) could not. The use of phototypesetting grew rapidly in the 1960s when software was developed to convert <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> <b>copy,</b> usually typed on paper tape, to the codes that controlled the phototypesetters.|$|R

Transformations of the tags {{of the basic}} {{as well as the}} complete SGML <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> compuscript are dealt with in detail for the examples: a letter, bridge lay-out, some mathematics and a simple table. At the end some guidelines are provided in order to decide when SGML, rn, or both, might be beneficial, along with a conclusion. It is a 3 -in- 1 paper: (1) what SGML and is all about. aimed at novices; (2) examples of <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> <b>copy</b> in SGML and (La) m and the coupling issues, for those already familiar with SGML and m, but like to be informed about transformation issues, when mathematics or tables are part of the compuscript; (3) finally. a literature compilation, for those who consider bibliographies at hand useful.

40|$|This volume {{constitutes}} one of {{only three}} known 17 th-century annotated “prompt books ” of Shakespeare’s longest play, Hamlet, that have survived to the present day. The earliest, the so-called “Smock Alley Hamlet, ” named after the Dublin theater where it was performed, is located at the University of Edinburgh. It derives from the 1663 Third Folio edition of the collected plays, which was broken up, and the plays bound separately, by the Shakespeare scholar J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps before his donation of his Shakespeare collection to the University Library in Edinburg. It may have been annotated as early as 1680. The other copy, now at the Folger Shakespeare Library, is a <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> <b>copy</b> of the 1683 quarto. Like the Johns Hopkins 1676 Hamlet prompt book, the Folger quarto was annotated, by the same actor, and in quite similar ways, for another performance of the play...|$|R

50|$|Rudloe {{submitted}} {{an article}} to Sports Illustrated describing how an alligator attacked and ate his dog in 1981. The editor sent a copy to Dr. F Wayne King, Professor and {{curator of the}} Florida University's Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville who returned a <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> <b>copy</b> of the article with numerous objections taking particular exception to three items. Rudloe described the alligator as rearing to an upright position with front arms apart and fingers spread, he described vapour from the alligator's nostrils and how the alligator puffed up when Rudloe leaped on it and wrestled it in a vain attempt to save the dog. Based on the review, the editor excoriated Rudloe as a fraud and Rudloe did not write for Sports Illustrated again. Alligators have been observed to rise up and balance on their hind legs {{as part of a}} forward or upward lunge. King himself later published {{that it is possible to}} observe vapour from an alligator's nostrils and for them to puff up (although in the context of bellowing). There are also observations of alligators puffing up when aggressive. Rudloe eventually published the account in Audubon (1982) and Readers' Digest (1983) instead.|$|R

On 11 December 1908 Bierce wrote to George Sterling that he had completed work on The Devil's Dictionary.|$|R

Upon seeing the advertisements, however, they {{could not bear to}} ruin {{the look and feel of}} the {{publication}} by running them. It was decided that Portfolio would run without the aesthetic burden of advertising, freeing up more space for the overall design. Brodovitch was responsible for sorting through the articles and illustrations to create the spreads. Zachary described watching Brodovitch in action: He'd go through the stuff fast, really fast, and pick out always the right thing, you know, and then he would <b>mark</b> it <b>up</b> <b>copying,</b> an inch, inch and a half, two and a half inches...

40|$|We {{present the}} first case study {{involving}} the use of dynamic homework annotation, where an instructor uses a pen input device and a microphone to record audio comments while <b>marking</b> <b>up</b> an electronic <b>copy</b> of a student’s homework assignment. The student can then view the resulting animation using any web browser, for an experience {{similar to that of}} sitting beside an instructor who personally explains the strong and weak points of the student’s work.

In this paper, we discuss our assessment of both of these issues resulting from use of dynamic homework annotation in a semester-long graduate data structures course at Clemson University. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{prepress}} {{industry has}} witnessed unprecedented {{change over the}} last decade. Economic changes in the prepress industry have caused publishers of short run publications to depend {{on a variety of}} sources for color proofing materials. Color proofs can be supplied from as many as fifty different proofing systems. Advertisers now provide complete and partial advertisements directly to the publication printer. These changes have caused not only a reorganization of work flow in publication printers, but a need to examine more stringent rules concerning the variety of color proofs accepted for one publication. Color proofs, which are used for on press color approval, are supplied from three primary sources: Proofs produced by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s on site production department Proofs supplied by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s service bureau(s) Proofs supplied by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s advertiser The publication printer 2 ̆ 7 s task is to receive supplied materials, process these materials through the production process and use these materials for on-press color approval. Contractual arrangements between the publisher and the publication printer exist which establish how, and to what extent materials will be processed, or examined. These processes depend upon the submission of 2 ̆ 2 accurate 2 ̆ 2 color proofs. Lack of training of the publication printer 2 ̆ 7 s personnel, and film and film related issues result in the processing of unacceptable proofs through the production progress. Proofs that do not accurately represent desired color are used as press color target. The author hypothesizes that the greater the variety of color proofs used, the more likely a color quality complaint will be submitted. The use of such proofs results in inferior or unacceptable product being produced on press. A publication printer that produces a range of publications exists as a microcosm of the printing industry. Three publications produced at a color publication printer will be evaluated as to type of proofs submitted for issues produced for distribution in 1997 - 1998. These publications will be called publication A, publication B, and publication C. All three publications use supplied proofs received from film houses, advertisers, or are customer generated proofs. Proofs produced by the printer will not be considered. Customer color quality complaints for these publications will be gathered so a degree of customer dissatisfaction can be quantified. Customer complaints exist in three formats: Written complaints submitted by the publisher Verbal complaints documented by the customer service representative through quality complaint inquiries. The submission of <b>marked</b> <b>up</b> <b>copies</b> showing folio pages considered 2 ̆ 2 less than acceptable 2 ̆ 2 quality. Information gathered will be evaluated and a conclusion will be made about whether publications with a greater variety of color proofs received a higher number of quality complaints...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> tend to be pro {{cyclical}} in manufacturing and counter cyclical in market services. However, at the sectoral level value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> may be misinterpreted if intermediate input variations are ignored. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} the manufacturing sectors, although less so in that of market services. In fact, this is the main explanation for the (pro cyclical) behaviour of relative services manufacturing <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> which, in turn, play an important role in their relative price dynamics of these sectors. In addition, fluctuations in demand also play a role. In the case of services, <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend negatively on current output and positively on future output; hence in periods when demand is recovering (declining) <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> widen (narrow). By contrast, in the manufacturing sectors <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend positively on the current output gap and negatively on future expected demand, i. e. when demand is recovering (declining) current <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> fall (rise). sectoral mark-ups, gross output, aggregation, intermediate inputs...|$|R
