In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted <b>marketing</b> <b>at</b> women in the country as a method of building the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. The character also spawned a soap-filled sponge product manufactured by SpongeTech.|$|E

5|$|Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands (born August 26, 1988) is an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher {{who is currently}} a free agent. He played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he {{earned a degree in}} sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in the farm system, they invited him to spring training in 2014.

His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development.
