40|$|Cryo-electron {{tomography}} (CET) {{of fully}} hydrated, vitrified biological specimens {{has emerged as}} a vital tool for biological research. For cellular studies, the conventional imaging <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy places stringent constraints on sample thickness because of its dependence on phase coherence for contrast generation. Here we demonstrate the feasibility <b>of</b> using scanning <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy for cryo-tomography of unstained vitrified specimens (CSTET). We compare CSTET and CET for the imaging of whole bacteria and human tissue culture cells, finding favorable contrast and detail in the CSTET reconstructions. Particularly at high sample tilts, the CSTET signals contain more informative data than energy-filtered CET phase contrast images, resulting in improved depth resolution. Careful control over dose delivery permits relatively high cumulative exposures before the onset of observable beam damage. The increase in acceptable specimen thickness broadens the applicability of electron cryo-tomography...|$|R

40|$|Enterococcus mundtii {{was shown}} to be {{directly}} correlated with flacherie disease of the silkworm larvae reared on artificial diet supplemented with chloramphenicol. Its identification {{was carried out by}} means of light and electron microscopy and nucleotide sequencing of 16 S gene. The bacterium is capable of rapidly multiplying in the silkworm gut and of invading other body tissues, as demonstrated by deliberate infection of germfree larvae and by subsequent TEM observations. E. mundtii can endure alkaline pH of the silkworm gut and it has been proved to adapt in vitro to commonly applied doses of chloramphenicol, whose use can further contribute to reduce competition by other bacteria in Bombyx mori alimentary canal. The <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> the infection to the larvae was among the objectives of the present research. Since contamination of the progeny by mother moths can be avoided through routine egg shell disinfection, a trans-ovarian vertical transmission can be ruled out. On the other hand the bacterium was for the first time identified on mulberry leaves, and therefore artificial diet based on leaf powder could be a source of infection. We showed that while microwaved diet could contain live E. mundtii cells, the autoclaved diet is safe in this respect. Being E. mundtii also part of the human-associated microbiota, and since B. mori is totally domestic species, a possible role of man in its epidemiology can be postulated...|$|R

40|$|English: The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{is steadily}} increasing in severity throughout the developing world. Recently, Southeast Asia {{has become a}} rising concern for health care {{professionals in the field}} of infectious disease (UNAIDS, 2004). Most of Southeast Asia is experiencing surging prevalence and incidence rates of HIV infection. One particular country of interest is India. India’s population has surpassed one billion, making it the world’s second most populated country. India’s large population exacerbates the problematic scenario of HIV sero-prevalence rates that are increasing throughout the country and region (De Cock & Weiss, 2000; Rao, et al, 2004; UNAIDS, 2004). Youths in India lack knowledge about HIV and also have misconceptions about <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> and many harbor negative attitudes towards those who test positive for HIV.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} epidemiology and clinical manifestations of oral infection by Human papillomavirus (HPV), with particular attention to potential malignant lesions. Materials and methods. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to describe the state of the art about HPV infection in oropharyngeal mucosa and its <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> with particular attention to possible simultaneous infection in multiple anatomic sites. The aspects of prevention and control of infection by administering vaccines and the diffusion of sexual education campaigns are discussed also. Therapeutic protocols are also described where necessary. Results. In recent years there has been a growing interest in HPV oral medicine, suggesting a role of such a family of viruses in the development of neoplasms of the oropharyngeal district as well as of the uterine cervix. Even if the mass media have increasingly faced the problem, causing frequent alarming among patients, the dentist therefore needs a complete and up-to-date knowledge of this infectious condition that is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted mucous membrane infections (e. g. genital, anal and oral).

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades several {{revisions}} of the concepts underlying interneuronal communication in the central nervous system have been advanced. We propose here to classify communicational phenomena between cells of the central neural tissue under two general frames: ''wiring'' and ''volume'' transmission. ''Wiring'' transmission is defined as intercellular communication occurring through a well-defined connecting structure. Thus, wiring transmission Is characterized by the presence of physically identifiable communication channels within the neuronal and/or glial cell network. It includes synaptic transmission but also other types of intercellular communication through a connecting structure (e. g., gap junctions). ''Volume'' transmission is characterized by signal diffusion in a three-dimensional fashion within the brain extracellular fluid. Thus, multiple, structurally often not well characterized extracellular pathways connect intercommunicating cells. Volume transmission includes short- (but larger than synaptic cleft, i. e. about 20 nm) and long-distance diffusion of signals through the extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid. It must be underlined that the definitions of wiring and volume transmission focus on the <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> and are neutral with respect to the source and target <b>of</b> the <b>transmission,</b> as well as type of informational substance transmitted. Therefore, any cell present in the neural tissue (neurons, astroglia, microglia, ependyma, tanycytes, etc.) can be a source or a target of wiring and volume transmission. In this paper we discuss the basic definitions and some distinctive characteristics of the two types <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> In addition, we review the evidence for different types of intercellular communication besides synaptic transmission in the central nervous system during phylogeny, and in vertebrates in physiological and pathological conditions...|$|R

Serologic surveys were conducted from May 2013 to December 2014 in 4 sentinel villages. More than 9400 blood specimens were collected in filter papers from all inhabitants at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter, for up to 18 months, for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between {{the intensity of the}} human antibody response and entomological indicators <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (human biting rates and entomological inoculation rates [EIRs]) was studied using a multivariate 3 -level mixed model analysis.

In the present paper, the genealogic <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> those polymorphic coding and noncoding variants of BRCA genes in family's members has been investigated. Thirty families, enrolled within the Genetic Counselling Program of our Institute, with probands and at least one-first degree relative ( =  67 family members) available, have been studied for both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 pathological mutation and polymorphic variants' transmission. Ten and 6 probands carried Mendelian transmitted mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, respectively. Polymorphic coding and noncoding variants were transmitted in each family's relatives with a frequency ranging from 42 to 100 %, with similar rate for each SNP in mutated and nonmutated families with the only exception of BRCA 1 K 1183 R significantly more frequent in mutated families ( =  0. 004); conversely, this SNP and BRCA 2 N 372 H, were more frequently present in breast cancer relatives belonging to families in which pathological BRCA mutations were not present.

Here we investigated whether the inhibition of nociceptive sensory information, produced by activation of the sensorimotor cortex, involves a direct presynaptic modulation of C primary afferents. In anaesthetized male Wistar rats, we analyzed the effects of sensorimotor cortex activation on post tetanic potentiation (PTP) and the paired pulse ratio (PPR) of dorsal horn field potentials evoked by C-fiber stimulation in the sural (SU) and sciatic (SC) nerves. We also explored {{the time course of}} the excitability changes in nociceptive afferents produced by cortical stimulation. We observed that the development of PTP was completely blocked when C-fiber tetanic stimulation was paired with cortex stimulation. In addition, sensorimotor cortex activation by topical administration of bicuculline (BIC) produced a reduction in the amplitude of C-fiber responses, as well as an increase in the PPR. Furthermore, increases in the intraspinal excitability of slow-conducting fiber terminals, produced by sensorimotor cortex stimulation, were indicative of primary afferent depolarization. Topical administration of BIC in the spinal cord blocked the inhibition of C-fiber neuronal responses produced by cortical stimulation. Dorsal horn neurons responding to sensorimotor cortex stimulation also exhibited a peripheral receptive field and responded to stimulation of fast cutaneous myelinated fibers. Our results suggest that corticospinal inhibition of nociceptive responses {{is due in part to}} a modulation of the excitability of primary C-fibers by means of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons...|$|R

40|$|In Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) endemic areas, {{there are}} a number of {{subjects}} that are positive to serological tests but in whom trypanosomes are difficult to detect with the available parasitological tests. In most cases and particularly in West Africa, these subjects remain untreated, thus posing a fundamental problem both at the individual level (because of a possible lethal evolution of the disease) and at the epidemiological level (since they are potential reservoirs of trypanosomes). Xenodiagnosis may constitute an alternative for this type of cases. The objective of this study was to update the use of xenodiagnosis to detect trypanosomes in infected host characterized by low parasitaemia levels. This was carried out experimentally by infecting cattle and pigs with Trypanosoma congolense and T. brucei gambiense respectively, and by feeding tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans submorsitans and G. palpalis gambiensis, from the CIRDES colonies) on these animals at a time when the observed blood parasitaemia were low or undetectable by the classical microscopic parasitological tests used for the monitoring of infected animals. Our results showed that: i) the G. p. gambiensis colony at CIRDES could not be infected with the T. b. gambiense stocks used; ii) midgut infections of G. m. submorsitans were observed with both T. congolense and T. b. gambiense; iii) xenodiagnosis remains positive even at very low blood parasitaemia for both T. congolense and T. b. gambiense; and iv) to implement T. b. gambiense xenodiagnosis, batches of 20 G. m. submorsitans should be dissected two days after the infective meal. These results constitute a first step toward a possible implementation of xenodiagnosis to better characterize the parasitological status of seropositive individuals and the <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> parasite <b>transmission</b> in HAT foci...|$|R
40|$|Three textual traditions can {{be discerned}} in Arabic medical literature: the early {{translations}} from Greek, Syriac and Indian sources; the autochthonous tradition, which reached its height between the tenth and thirteenth centuries; and the translations from Latin sources, {{beginning in the}} seventeenth century. This study traces the medical use of mercury and its derivatives within these traditions. The Greek works translated into Arabic like those of Galen or Paul of Aegina did not prescribe mercury as a remedy for human beings because of its toxicity. However, many scholars of the second period, including Rhazes (d. 925), Ibn al-Jazzār (d. 979), Avicenna (d. 1037), Abū l-ʿAlāʾ Zuhr (d. 1131) and Muḥammad al-Idrīsī (d. 1166), described the external application of mercury. Many terms were used to describe these varieties of mercury – the living (ziʾbaq ḥayy), the dead (ziʾbaq mayyit), the murdered (ziʾbaq maqtūl), the sublimated (ziʾbaq muṣaʿʿad) and the dust of mercury (turāb al-ziʾbaq). To reconstruct the meaning of these terms, I examine various recipes for mercurial preparation given in these works. The internal use of mercury is documented {{in the sixteenth century}} in a work by Dawūd al-Anṭākī (d. 1599), who used the term sulaymānī to refer to a sublimated derivative of mercury. I attempt to reconstruct the <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transmission</b> from the Indian and Persian East into Arabic medicine, and from the Arabic world into the Latin West. I also address the impact of translations into Arabic of Latin works in the seventeenth century, such as the Practicae medicinae and Institutionum medicinae by Daniel Sennert (d. 1637), the Antidotarium generale et speciale by Johann Jacob Wecker (d. 1586) and the Basilica Chymica by the Paracelsian Oswaldus Crollius (d. 1608) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a typology of knowledge transfers highlights main dimensions of this process : the sources of transfers and recipients; the nature and <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, factual or procedural; the constraints weighing on the actors; use <b>of</b> channels <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> and formalization <b>of</b> knowledge. This article shows how transfers of knowledge raise ethical problems {{in the field of}} the diffusion of new knowledge and in that of education, which force the authorities to intervene, in particular through the patents system and by ensuring free access to education. The rules and institutions are analysed in reference to the criteria of an ethical nature proposed by utilitarianism, libertarism and liberal egalitarianism. ...|$|R

A close analysis shows {{that even in the}} best documented case, as modern readers look at a transcription of the manuscript page, they should not expect to see reflected back at them the image of an original song, free from the influence of oral and written transmission. This reading takes into account the <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> these two strata <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> as they are deployed, complicating each other in each particular case. Key lexemes are bound to melodic leaps, pitch goals and melismas. Manuscript evidence suggests that these accentuated lexemes were more stable in the transmission tradition than others; just as in the textual stratum there is more variation in the beginnings of the verses than in the ends, stabilized by rhymes...|$|R
