500|$|In Planica, Herzog quoted Steiner {{as having}} said that {{he felt like he}} was in an arena with 50,000 people waiting to see him crash. On the third day of the event, while talking to journalists after a jump, Steiner {{appeared}} jaded at the organisers' pressure on him to set more world records at the expense of his well-being: [...] "They let <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> too far four times. That shouldn't happen. It's scandalous of those Yugoslav judges up there who are responsible." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{contract}} was terminated {{by mutual consent}} with a year to run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day. On joining Wycombe, Mousinho said [...] "It's been my local club since I was quite young so I've been down here {{a few times and}} it was the lure of that, plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor, that made <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> at the chance". He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1–1 draw against Morecambe, and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2–0 away victory over Chester City. Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010. Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe's 3–3 draw against his former employers, Brentford, netting in the first–half of the game with a volley. Two weeks later, he provided the assist for John Akinde's goal in the club's 1–1 draw with Barnet. He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place. The following season, he played a further 41 games for the club, scoring once in a 5–2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, but Wycombe were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. During his two years at Wycombe, he played a total of 79 times for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

5000|$|Sien resumed {{her life}} as a seamstress, {{cleaning}} woman and likely prostitute before marrying in 1901. On 12 November 1904, aged 54, she threw herself into the Schelde river and drowned, fulfilling a prediction she had made to van Gogh in 1883: [...] "what the bad moods are is still more desperate ... 'it’s bound to end up with <b>me</b> <b>jumping</b> into the water.|$|R
2500|$|After the crash, despite {{breaking}} his pelvis, Knievel addressed {{the audience and}} announced his retirement by stating, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen of this wonderful country, I've {{got to tell you}} that you are the last {{people in the world who}} will ever see <b>me</b> <b>jump.</b> Because I will never, ever, ever jump again. I'm through." [...] Near shock and not yielding to Frank Gifford's (of ABC's Wide World of Sports) plea to use a stretcher, Knievel walked off the Wembley pitch stating, [...] "I came in walking, I went out walking!" ...|$|E

Then we can play that it was <b>me</b> <b>jumped</b> out of the dark and s'prised you with that noise--same as I did in the beaver-swamp last winter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, wouldn't she? By heaven, then, she shall, {{and that}} without any {{kneeling}} at all. She shall have me, and be deuced glad to take me. What! she'd refuse a fellow like {{me when she}} knows that she and all belonging to her'd be turned into the streets if she don't have me! I'm clear of another way of thinking, then. My opinion is she'd come to <b>me</b> <b>jumping.</b> I'll tell you what, governor, you don't know the sex." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If you can't play without {{snorting}} like that, my boy," [...] said Mr. Chugwater, {{a little}} irritably, [...] "you must {{find some other}} game. You made <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> just as I was going to beat my record." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he answered, {{with such}} {{tremendous}} emphasis that he almost made <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> from my seat. [...] "Are you alone so ignorant {{of these things}} that you speak of building and of pulling down a house?" ...|$|E

6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} the officer who had hurt <b>me</b> <b>jumped</b> down among us. The instant he saw what we were at, he sang out--"Halloo! here's high life below stairs!" [...] Then he called to another officer to bear a hand down and see the fun. Some one sung out from among {{ourselves}} to [...] "dowse the glim." [...] The lights were put out, and then the two officers capsized the whiskey. While this was doing, most of the Englishmen ran up the forward hatch. We Julias all remained below.|$|R
60|$|But {{pretty soon}} {{there was plenty}} of sound, for the lion was {{catching}} up. His noise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope from every direction, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under <b>me,</b> <b>jumping</b> up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other; and so we went skimming along over the sand, and these fellers doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion; and then some other beasts come, without an invite, and they started a regular riot down there.|$|R

6000|$|... (Here a kick to an {{intervening}} spaniel, which flies yelping {{from before}} the fire, and a rapid advance on the tambour-frame.) [...] "Look here, cousin! If you were to bid <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> out of yonder window, I should do it; or murder, I should do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Merwell! He's escaped! He got the gun {{away from}} <b>me,</b> and <b>jumped</b> through the window!" [...] panted poor Shadow. [...] "Oh, what a fool I was {{to think he}} was asleep!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{shut the}} door quietly, and {{immediately}} I heard the key turn in the lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I was locked in. For a minute I {{did not know what}} to do. I walked from door to window and back, and stood perplexed. A gust of anger came upon me. But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further, and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf. This brought him back, more sinister than ever. That time he actually touched <b>me,</b> <b>jumped</b> back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room.|$|R

6000|$|There {{was such}} a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen the child, my very fears made <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> to the absurdity of the idea.

6000|$|... "The {{man who was}} {{kneeling}} on me and squeezing {{the life out of}} <b>me</b> <b>jumped</b> up when he heard Lopez coming, and struck him over the head with a bludgeon. I heard the blow, though I was pretty well done for at the time myself. I don't think they hit me, but they got something round my neck, and I was half strangled before I knew what they were doing. Poor Lopez bled horribly, but he says he is none the worse for it." [...] Here there was another little pressure under the bed-clothes; for Emily felt that her brother was pleading for her in every word that he said.|$|R
