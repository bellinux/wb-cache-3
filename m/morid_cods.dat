Many {{are members of the}} family Gadidae; others are members of three related families within the order Gadiformes whose names include the word [...] "cod": the <b>morid</b> <b>cods,</b> Moridae (100 or so species); the eel cods, Muraenolepididae (four species); and the Eucla cod, Euclichthyidae (one species). The tadpole cod family (Ranicipitidae) has now been placed in Gadidae.|$|E

50|$|The tadpole cod is {{a member}} of the family Moridae, the <b>morid</b> <b>cods,</b> related to the true cods (of genus Gadus, family Gadidae).
