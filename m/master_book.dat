50|$|Plot {{generators}} {{were described}} {{as early as the}} 1930s. In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, Robert J. Hogan described a book-based device called the Plot Genie which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called The 36 Dramatic Situations and Plotto: The <b>Master</b> <b>Book</b> of All Plots. Plotto by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.|$|E
50|$|In {{situations}} {{where there are}} multiple stage managers or assistants, {{it is not uncommon}} for many copies of the prompt book to exist. Generally a lead stage manager will keep the <b>master</b> <b>book,</b> which is then copied by assistants on a nightly basis to account for any new information inserted during rehearsals, productions, and meetings. While all prompt books will contain some of the same basic information (script, cast list, contact information, set drawings, etc.), there is no official standard, and individual stage managers will determine the best way of keeping books for themselves and the productions they manage. While Actors' Equity Association, the union governing professional stage managers in the United States, does not publish any official pragma for a prompt book, such practices are often covered as part of college curricula, and many books exist on the subject.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1924, Gillham {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Columbia Records as an exclusive artist. When Columbia obtained rights to record using the new Western Electric recording system, Gillham was asked by Columbia to assist with the electric recording because of his use of microphones on radio. (Walsh, Hobbies Magazine and recorded interview) On February 25-27, 1925 Art recorded seven electrical masters, six of which were released. (Brian Rust The Columbia <b>Master</b> <b>Book</b> Discography, Vol. III, p 19-20) Columbia began using the new electrical process with its other artists beginning on February 27, 1925. The first electrical master was 140125, [...] "You May Be Lonesome" [...] released on Columbia 328-D, the first issue being on Columbia's [...] "flag" [...] label prior to the change to the black label. Victor began using the electrical process in March 1925.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{librarian}} was the Theatine priest Paolo Maria Paciaudi, who {{was assigned}} as [...] "Antiquario e Bibliotecario". The {{goal was to}} form a public library {{as part of a}} project by Duke Filippo's prime minister, Guillaume Du Tillot. The library lacked many of the works that had been collected by the House of Farnese while ruling in Parma, when the future Charles III of Spain, brother of Filippo and who was Duke from 1731 to 1735, moved the local library and archives to Naples in 1736. Paciaudi failed to acquire the collections of Cardinal Domenico Passionei in Roma and of the Pertusati family of Milan, and thus embarked on shopping for books in the market. He catalogued his purchases under six main classes: Theology, Nomology, Philosophy, History, Philology, and Liberal and Mechanic Arts. The books required the importation of Louis Antoine Laferté, a <b>master</b> <b>book</b> binder.|$|E
50|$|Men of the {{business}} community could join The Merchants Fund as yearly or lifetime members, and within the first year, membership numbered over 300. Between 1866 and 1880, The Merchants Fund also made appeals to individuals, banks, insurance companies, and other businesses to establish a permanent fund. Most of the organization’s assets were invested in real estate and rail, and there is overlap between the members and officers of The Merchants Fund and the growth of the local, regional and national rail systems at this time. Beneficiaries largely received aid through applications in which they would describe their need and occasionally state that if they did not receive aid, they would be forced to become public charges. The Fund members frequently tried to keep merchants from this fate, particularly those that they considered visible and respectable in the community. To confirm neediness or illness, doctors visited {{the business}} person and his family, and applicants could apply for short or long-term aid. Minutes repeatedly state that beneficiaries were respectable people who have lost their means of income, and their names were kept strictly confidential among the five members of the executive committee. Meeting minutes listed grantees anonymously with a number and a description of the individual’s circumstances, and the grantees’ names were kept confidential in a <b>master</b> <b>book</b> by the secretary.|$|E
5000|$|The Worlds of Power series omitted violent {{elements}} in the video games. Video game covers were adapted into the book covers after weaponry was omitted. For instance in Ninja Gaiden cover, the dagger that Ryu Hayabusa held {{in front of him}} is no longer visible. In Metal Gear cover, Solid Snake no longer holds his gun; 1up.com Scott Sharkey said that without the gun, Snake was [...] "making a vaguely masturbatory gesture." [...] Within the texts, death and violence were not inflicted on humans and animals. In the Blaster <b>Master</b> <b>book,</b> the bosses appearing like mutated animals are holographic projections placed on formless blobs. In the Metal Gear book, Snake—described as a [...] "walking arsenal"—uses his guns only to pistol whip enemies. In the Ninja Gaiden book, Ryu Hayabusa's father—seemingly killed in the prologue of the game and said to be dead in earlier book chapters—is revealed as alive {{by the end of the}} book. In the Infiltrator book, an agent scheduled to be [...] "voided" [...] either has his memory wiped clean, receives exiling, or receives a demotion. In Bionic Commando, the protagonist's gun shoots [...] "stun bullets" [...] and the protagonist uses karate chops to disable enemies. Towards the end of that book, a clone of Adolf Hitler kills the enemy leader; the protagonist feels no sympathy since the leader was, as stated by 1up.com, [...] "an evil man being eliminated by an even more evil man." [...] In addition, overtly magical and occult references were omitted from the Before Shadowgate book.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{collaborative}} project (2005) bringing together the creative {{visions of the}} artists: Prof. Kim, Song Yeol from Pai-Chai University, Dae Jeon, South Korea and Dr. Gordon James Brown from James Cook University, Townsville, Australia. The project {{is the creation of}} an artists' book, "The Strand", featuring twenty-nine hand-printed original etchings taken from lino blocks in a limited edition of six hand-bound books. Each page of the book shows the collaboration of the two artists in portraying cultural differences and congruence regarding their perception of the Strand—a road and walkway leading around the shoreline of Townsville. Each book is bound in cloth by the <b>master</b> <b>book</b> binders, F. & R. Pohlmann. The etchings are printed on BFK Reeves Crème paper with ten single pages, two gate-fold pages, a title page and a colophon page. Size dimensions for The Strand is 37 x 40. 5 cm...|$|E
