5000|$|Despite Rimbault's {{acknowledgement}} of John Evelyn {{in the title}} {{and in the first}} line of the preface, Monson and Ashbee had problems with Rimbault's account, possibly because of the previously mentioned errors. Monson observed Rimbault said that the books were [...] "formerly in the possession of the celebrated John Evelyn." [...] Yet they didn't appear in Evelyn's own <b>manuscript</b> <b>catalog</b> nor do they carry Evelyn's ownership mark. Ashbee admits the possibilities that the partbooks might have been given away prior to the creation of Evelyn's catalog, but noted that no mention of Evelyn is in the auction catalog of Rimbault's library.|$|E
50|$|Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis (Księga uposażeń biskupstwa wrocławskiego, Book of endowments of the Bishopric of Wrocław) is a Latin <b>manuscript</b> <b>catalog</b> of {{documents}} compiled {{in the later}} 13th or in the early 14th century. It lists towns and villages obliged to pay a tithe to the Bishopric of Wrocław. As a primary source it helps to recreate territorial extent, structure and revenues of the contemporary Diocese of Wrocław, additionally hundreds of villages in Silesia were being attested {{for the first time}} in their history, hence the importance of the document. The exact date of the document is not determined, but most often it is believed to be compiled in 1305, during Henryk of Wierzbna bishophood, who tried to reorganize bishopric's finances.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} notion of the Buddhist canon in seventh- and eighth-century Japan. It relies on {{scriptorium}} documents, temple records, and <b>manuscripts</b> of <b>catalogs</b> to argue that there was no single Buddhist canon in ancient Japan; each was created at a particular moment in a unique configuration to respond {{to the needs of the}} patron and the monastic community. For this reason, Buddhist canons in the Japanese case are best understood in the plural. But rather than simply focusing on what the canon was as a noun, this article examines the dynamic processes through which canons were produced as systematized collections of texts. It shows how monks, rulers, and administrators in the capital consulted continental catalogs but were never bound by them. Canon copying provided a means for individuals at court to demonstrate their mastery over the Buddhist tradition...|$|R

40|$|GUTENBERG’S was {{the mass}} produc- INVENTION tion of {{manuscript}}s. Even today a printed book {{is simply a}} manuscript in print. As a result the rules for <b>cataloging</b> <b>manuscripts</b> have generally followed the principles for cataloging printed books. W. C. Ford‘s brief remarks on manuscripts in Cutter’s rules (1904) and the rules for manuscripts in the A. L. A. codes since then (1908, 1941, and 1949) all recognized this fact. The more elaborate attempts to draw up rules only for <b>cataloging</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> {{such as those of}} the Library of Congress, the Minnesota Historical Society: and Dorothy V. Martin: all lean heavily upon the A. L. A. principles and even the Library of Congress list of subject headings. It is true that every manuscript is a unique individual. But that does not justify rugged individualism in their catalogers. In the be-ginning each library had to work out its own practices for <b>cataloging</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> just as {{it had to do with}} printed books. But standardizing influences came early. Chief, perhaps, has been the union catalog. Union lists from the thirteenth century Registrum Librorum Angliae to Seymour de Ricci’s Census, and movements for national union <b>catalogs</b> of <b>manuscripts</b> in Germany, Italy, this country, 5 and elsewhere-each sought first of all a finding guide, but each also pushed steadily if not sensationally toward standardization. Also publications, such as the articles in the American Archivist and other journals and the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Manuscripts of the American Historical Association have shared in the movement to standardize cataloging. As with printed books, the <b>cataloging</b> of <b>manuscripts</b> has gravitated, sometimes uneasily, but always relentlessly, toward simplification. The describers give way to the finders. Detailed description of the manuscript as a physical object, like detailed description of the printed book, was a necessary tool for the scholar in the days of private libraries, difficult and expensive travel...|$|R
