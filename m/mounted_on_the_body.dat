500|$|In {{keeping with}} the wartime German design {{philosophy}} of mounting an existing anti-tank gun on a convenient chassis to give mobility, several tank destroyers and infantry support guns were built around the Panzer IV hull. Both the Jagdpanzer IV, initially armed with the [...] L/48 tank gun, and the Krupp-manufactured Sturmgeschütz IV, which was the casemate of the Sturmgeschütz III <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the Panzer IV, proved highly effective in defense. Cheaper and faster to construct than tanks, but with the disadvantage of a very limited gun traverse, around 1,980 Jagdpanzer IVs and 1,140 Sturmgeschütz IVs were produced. Another tank destroyer, the Panzer IV/70, used the same basic 75millimeter L/70 gun that was mounted on the Panther.|$|E

2500|$|Communication {{with the}} {{spacecraft}} is via X band. The craft had a communication rate of [...] at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, {{a rate of}} approximately [...] per transmitter is expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5hours (one-way). The [...] NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond Jupiter. [...] The spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization. [...] The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> under the dish. The receivers are new, low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability is now considered operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered).|$|E

2500|$|Making a wayang kulit {{figure that}} is {{suitable}} for a performance involves hand work that takes several weeks, with the artists working together in groups. They start from master models (typically on paper) which are traced out onto skin or parchment, providing the figures with an outline and with indications of any holes that {{will need to be}} cut (such as for the mouth or eyes). The figures are then smoothed, usually with a glass bottle, and primed. The structure is inspected and eventually the details are worked through. A further smoothing follows before individual painting, which is undertaken by yet another craftsman. Finally, the movable parts (upper arms, lower arms with hands and the associated sticks for manipulation) <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> which has a central staff by which it is held. A crew makes up to ten figures at a [...] time, typically completing that number {{over the course of a}} week. However, unfortunately there is not strong continuing demand for the top skills of wayang craftspersons and the relatively few experts still skilled at the art sometimes find it difficult to earn a satisfactory income.|$|E
