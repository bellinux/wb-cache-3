5000|$|<b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> — This {{is used in}} serial {{communication}} and makes use of a compact, binary representation of the data for protocol communication. The RTU format follows the commands/data with a cyclic redundancy check checksum as an error check mechanism to ensure the reliability of data. <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> {{is the most common}} implementation available for Modbus. A <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> message must be transmitted continuously without inter-character hesitations. Modbus messages are framed (separated) by idle (silent) periods.|$|E
50|$|There {{are simple}} and complex types of {{conversions}} {{depending on the}} application and domain in which this is being used. The simplest and most commonly used conversion is protocol conversion between <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> and Modbus TCP. In this conversion, there is {{no change in the}} overall framing. Hence it is easy to take the Serial <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> frame and encapsulate it in a TCP/UDP socket and send it over Ethernet. Since both the protocol framings are the same, except for the actual physical layer transmission, both the application layers will interpret data similarly as long as the communication interfaces are made transparent.|$|E
5000|$|Modbus over TCP/IP or Modbus over TCP or Modbus RTU/IP — This is a Modbus variant that {{differs from}} Modbus TCP in that a {{checksum}} {{is included in}} the payload as with <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU.</b>|$|E
30|$|Below the {{horizontal}} dashed line in Fig.  3, the cyber {{elements of the}} testbed are presented: the control network, which consists mainly of a Modbus/TCP (The <b>Modbus</b> Organization 2012) <b>RTU</b> device (Number 5), the monitoring device (Number 6), and the SCADA server (Number 7).|$|R
50|$|Unit {{identifier}} is {{used with}} Modbus/TCP devices that are composites of several Modbus devices, e.g. on Modbus/TCP to <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> gateways. In such case, the unit identifier tells the Slave Address {{of the device}} behind the gateway. Natively Modbus/TCP-capable devices usually ignore the Unit Identifier.|$|E
50|$|SCADA {{protocols}} {{are designed}} to be very compact. Many {{are designed to}} send information only when the master station polls the RTU. Typical legacy SCADA protocols include <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU,</b> RP-570, Profibus and Conitel. These communication protocols, with the exception of Modbus (Modbus has been made open by Schneider Electric), are all SCADA-vendor specific but are widely adopted and used. Standard protocols are IEC 60870-5-101 or 104, IEC 61850 and DNP3. These communication protocols are standardized and recognized by all major SCADA vendors. Many of these protocols now contain extensions to operate over TCP/IP. Although the use of conventional networking specifications, such as TCP/IP, blurs the line between traditional and industrial networking, they each fulfill fundamentally differing requirements. Network simulation can be used in conjunction with SCADA simulators to perform varisou 'what-if' analyses.|$|E
30|$|The {{integration}} of the RTU device into the physical system is enabled by making the following connections, as indicated in Fig.  3 by black vertical lines: the controller (RTU) API invokes a thread which creates a simulation of the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device (Connection A). This connection is the actual link between the cyber and physical part of the testbed, therefore in Fig.  3 it is indicated with a solid line. It allows for the following relations: based on the values obtained from the power flow equation solver via the Mosaik interface, the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device determines the sensor measurements and forwards them to the control network (Correspondence B, marked with a dashed line); upon a command received from a SCADA server in the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device, this device applies the changes on the actuators in the testbed by changing the topology in the power distribution simulator (Correspondence C, marked with a dashed line).|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} {{with the possibility of}} inexpensive wireless communication, many products of tomorrow are developed with the support for wireless communication. The technology enables the possibilty of wireless communication to small plattforms at a realistic price. The cheap connectivity allows for great creativity and gives the developers imagination a wide discretion in the development of new products. This thesis aims to evaluate how the serial communication protocol <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> - RS 232, performs and behaves when transported through meshed networks (Atmel lightweight mesh will be used in this thesis). The work was commissioned by M 2 M Solutions in J¨onk¨oping. The report will answer the following questions 1. How does <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> behaves when transported through a meshed network. 2. How does <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> preform when transported through Atmel Lightweight Mesh. The authors have chosen to conduct action research to answer established questions. A test system consisting of both hardware and software was designed and created. With this system, several diﬀerent tests were conducted and the results were observed and subjected to reﬂection. The diﬀerent tests varied the distance, the network’s composition and location of the network infrastructure. Through observation of the test system and evaluation of the recorded data conclusions concering Modbus RTU’s performance and behavior during transport in Atmel lightweigh mesh has been drawn. The test system has been designed with the help of clients and previously made research. Modbus behaves nominally during transportation through Atmel lightweight mesh. Before the network is fully established, an inability to transport data has beend observed. The performance is evaluated by {{the time it takes to}} send data, the time is greatly aﬀected by the following factors; Network composition and changes in signal strength (that creates changes in transport routes). For each additional node that traﬃc is transported through an increase of 5 - 10 ms in the responstime was noted. The network’s ability to change the transport route is also expected to increase performance. The wireless communication provides a longer range than during transportation by standard conventional cable. Considering the results, the authors believe that <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> has the potential for use in transportation through wireless, meshed networks. One possible scenario is when several <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> masters are beeing used and data needs to be transported over large distances...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> {{protocol}} {{has been}} widely accepted {{in the application of}} robotics, communications and industrial control systems due to its simplicity and reliability. With the help of the MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox, a serial communication between Simulink and a 3 Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper can be realized to demonstrate a grasping functionality. The toolbox includes a “to instrument” and “query instrument” programming blocks that enable the users to create a serial communication with the targeted hardware/robot. Similarly, the Simulink Arduino IO package also offers a real-time feature that enabled it to act as a DAQ device. This paper establishes a real-time robot control by using <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> and Arduino IO Package for a 3 Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper. The robot communication and grasping performance were successfully implemented and demonstrated. In particular, three (3) different grasping mode via normal, wide and pinch were tested. Moreover, the robot gripper’s feedback data, such as encoder position, motor current and the grasping force were easily measured and acquired in real-time. This certainly essential for future grasping analysis of a 3 Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper...|$|E

30|$|In the following, an {{attacker}} {{can either}} perform a man-in-the-middle attack (cf. section “SCADA security”) and inject false messages between the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device and the SCADA server, or can directly take {{control over the}} SCADA server, as illustrated in Fig.  3. Both attacks result in a corrupted communication channel to the field station. Hence, both the network and the SCADA server cannot be trusted. Assume that an adversary sends well-formatted packets from the control room to the remote stations and has all necessary privileges to perform the requested commands. This means that other security mechanisms, such as standard Network IDS would not recognize such packets as potentially malicious.|$|E

30|$|Bro {{includes}} a Modbus/TCP parser, that generates events upon parsing packets of this protocol. The parser, for example, generates a modbus_write_single_coil_request event when parsing a Modbus/TCP packet containing a “write single coil request”. By creating a custom event handler, new policies {{that use the}} semantic information extracted from the parsed packet(s) can be instantiated {{in order to determine}} proper actions and alerts. By including this traffic monitoring, instead of directly storing the new value of a command from the SCADA server in the respective coil, as explained in section “SCADA system”, this command is first checked against a corresponding Bro policy. In the proposed testbed, the monitoring device is placed between the <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device {{and the rest of the}} network; in Fig.  3, Bro is indicated with Number 6.|$|E
30|$|On a {{previous}} project, energy analyzers from Siemens (Siemens PAC 4200) [28] and Janitza (UMG 96 RM) [29] companies were integrated {{in the local}} power grid and connected with the IT network via 10 / 100 MBit/s Ethernet. The energy analyzers are able to measure about 300 different values from the power grid. Both device types are equipped with a display unit to receive a quick overview of the current situation of the relevant power grid section and in addition, the devices provide <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> and Modbus over TCP/IP as communication protocols, {{which can be used}} to request data from the devices and for configuration. The devices refresh the measurements every 200 ms. This is the smallest interval for requesting data. In our scenario we collects data over the Modbus TCP/IP protocol every second.|$|E

The monitoring/metering system was developed for large building complexes and was validated in the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia University campus. The system considers two distinct applications. The first one allows the user to verify, in real time, the energy consumption of any department in the complex, produce load diagrams, tables and print, email or save all available data. The second application keeps records of active/reactive energy consumption in order to verify the existence of some anomalous situation, and also monthly charge energy consumption to each corresponding department...|$|E
30|$|In the {{presented}} scenario, the Modbus/TCP SCADA system {{consists of}} one RTU {{located in the}} field station and one SCADA server located in the control room, cf. Numbers 5 and 7 in Fig.  3. The RTU and SCADA server communicate over an untrusted network. Note that the central SCADA server {{is assumed to be}} an untrusted component as well, because of the possibility of the presence of insider attacks. The RTU reads the measurements from the sensors on power lines directly connected within the substation on bus B 5, and it controls a set of actuators (switches) connecting power lines attached to that bus, cf. Fig.  4 b. In the proposed testbed, the Mosaik controller (RTU) simulator creates a <b>Modbus</b> <b>RTU</b> device, which is a Modbus server listening on TCP port 10502 on the host machine. It uses the PyModbus library 2 to implement the Modbus/TCP protocol (The Modbus Organization 2012). SCADA server is a Modbus/TCP client created in a Virtual Machine.|$|E
40|$|A 3 - Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper is an {{advanced}} robotic research {{that provides a}} robotic hand-like capabilities due to its flexibility and versatility.
