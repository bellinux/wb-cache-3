In each model, the energy density may be minimized by a Bogomol'nyi bound which is saturated by solutions {{to a set of}} first-order self-duality equations. In the nonrelativistic case the self-dual potential is quartic, the system possesses a dynamical conformal symmetry, and the self-dual solutions are equivalent to the static zero energy solutions of the equations of motion. The nonrelativistic self-duality equations are integrable and all finite charge solutions may be found. In the relativistic case the self-dual potential is sixth order and the self-dual Lagrangian may be embedded in a model with an extended supersymmetry. The self-dual potential has a rich structure of degenerate classical minima, and the vacuum masses generated by the Chern-Simons Higgs mechanism reflect the self-dual nature of the potential.

40|$|The Dirac {{equation}} is a cornerstone {{in the history}} of physics, merging successfully quantum mechanics with special relativity, providing a natural description of the electron spin and predicting the existence of anti-matter. Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schrödinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to <b>nonrelativistic</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that neither the}} Klein-Gordon equation nor the Dirac Hamiltonian can produce sound solitary-particle relativistic quantum mechanics due to the ill effects of their negative-energy solutions; instead their field-quantized wavefunctions are reinterpreted as dealing with particle and antiparticle simultaneously [...] despite the clear physical distinguishability of antiparticle from particle and the empirically known slight breaking of the underlying CP invariance. The natural square-root Hamiltonian of the free relativistic solitary particle is iterated to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation and linearized to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian, steps that have calculational but not physical motivation, and which generate the above-mentioned problematic negative-energy solutions as extraneous artifacts. Since the natural square root Hamiltonian for the free relativistic solitary particle contrariwise produces physically unexceptionable quantum mechanics, {{this article focuses on}} extending that Hamiltonian to describe a solitary particle (of either spin 0 or spin one-half) in relativistic interaction with an external electromagnetic field. That is achieved by use of Lorentz-covariant solitary-particle four momentum techniques together with the assumption that well-known <b>nonrelativistic</b> <b>dynamics</b> applies in the particle's rest frame. Lorentz-invariant solitary particle actions, whose formal Hamiltonization is an equivalent alternative approach, are as well explicitly displayed. It is proposed that two separate solitary-particle wavefunctions, one for a particle and the other for its antiparticle, be independently quantized in lieu of "reinterpreting" negative energy solutions [...] which indeed don't even afflict proper solitary particles.

40|$|The {{modified}} newtonian dynamics (MOND) {{paradigm of}} Milgrom can boast {{of a number of}} successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are made without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant role. MOND requires gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where dynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories proposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or violated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an a priori vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory which resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar field and a 4 -vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of its free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for <b>nonrelativistic</b> <b>dynamics</b> with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are small. We calculate the beta and gamma PPN coefficients showing them to agree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for dynamics of particles. Consequently, the new theory predicts gravitational lensing by extragalactic structures that cannot be distinguished from that predicted within the dark matter paradigm by general relativity. Cosmological models based on the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions, this last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric, scalar and vector waves...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of an electron in crossed laser fields is investigated analytically. Two different standing wave configurations are compared.

40|$|Recently {{we showed}} that while the tensor force plays an {{important}} role in nuclear matter saturation in non-relativistic studies, it does not do so in relativistic studies. The reason behind this is the role of M^*, the sum of nucleon mass and its attractive self-energy in nuclear matter. Yet nonrelativistic calculations at a certain level of approximation are far less difficult than comparative relativistic calculation. Naturally the question arises if one can <b>modify</b> a <b>nonrelativistic</b> method, say, the lowest order Brueckner theory (LOBT), to reproduce approximately the results of a relativistic calculation. While a many body effect, the role of M^* is intrinsically relativistic. It cannot be simulated by adding multi-body forces in a nonrelativistic calculation. Instead, we examine if adding a set of recipes to LOBT can be useful for the purpose. We point out that the differences in the results arise principally from two reasons - first, the role of M^* and second, the disappearance in a relativistic treatment of the gap in the hole and particle energy spectra, present in LOBT. In this paper we show that LOBT, modified by recipes to remove these two reasons, generates results quite close to those of Dirac-Brueckner theory. Comment: 8 pages, revte...|$|R

40|$|In {{development}} of the old conjecture of Stuckelberg, Wheeler and Feynman on the so-called "one electron Universe", we elaborate a purely algebraic construction of an ensemble of identical pointlike particles occupying the same worldline and moving in concordance with each other. In the proposed construction one does not make use of any differential equations of motion, Lagrangians, etc. Instead, we define a "unique" worldline implicitly, by a system of nonlinear polynomial equations containing a time-like parameter. Then at each instant {{there is a whole}} set of solutions defining the coordinates of particles-copies localized on the unique worldline and moving along it. There naturally arise two different kinds of such particles which correspond to real or complex conjugate roots of the initial system of polynomial equations, respectively. At some particular time instants, one encounters the transitions between these two kinds of particles-roots that model the processes of annihilation or creation of a pair "particle-antiparticle". We restrict by consideration of <b>nonrelativistic</b> collective <b>dynamics</b> of the ensemble of such particles on a plane. Making use of the techniques of resultants of polynomials, the generating system reduces to a pair of polynomial equations for one unknown, with coefficients depending on time. Then the well-known Vieta formulas predetermine the existence of time-independent constraints on the positions of particles-roots and their time derivatives. We demonstrate that for a very wide class of the initial polynomials (with polynomial dependence of the coefficients on time) these constraints always take place and have the form of the conservation laws for total momentum, angular momentum and (the analogue of) total mechanical energy of the "closed" system of particles.

The ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density η/s of the fluid takes the universal value 1 / 4 π, while {{the ratio of}} Hall viscosity over entropy density η_A/s depends on the Σ_c and black brane charge q. Moreover the nonvortical dual fluid obeys the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equation. However, these kinematic viscosities ν and ν_A related to η and η_A do not appear in this MHD equation, due to the constraint condition ∂̃^ 2 β_j= 0 for the (2 + 1) -dimensional dual fluid. Then, we extend our discussion to the dynamical CS modified gravity and show that the dual vortical fluid possesses another so-called Curl viscosity ζ_A, whose ratio to entropy density ζ_A/s also depends on the Σ_c and q.
