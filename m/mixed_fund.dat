500|$|Equitable tracing {{is based}} not on legal {{ownership}} but on the claimant's possession of an equitable interest. There are several advantages to equitable tracing; first, it can trace property now mixed with other property. In Boscawen v Bajwa, Millett justified this by saying that [...] "equity's power to charge a <b>mixed</b> <b>fund</b> with the repayment of trust moneys enables the claimant to follow the money, {{not because it is}} his, but because it is derived from a fund which is treated as if it were subject to a charge in his favour". A limitation is that where the property has been put into a bank account that no longer contains enough money to repay it, it cannot be traced.|$|E
500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a <b>mixed</b> <b>fund,</b> therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|E
500|$|Where {{funds are}} mixed with those of another trust, or mixed with the funds of an [...] "innocent volunteer", certain general {{principles}} apply. As laid out in Re Diplock, the principle applied is that the claimant's entitlement ranks pari passu {{to that of the}} volunteer; each has an equal claim to their funds. Whether the fund decreases or increases in value, each party can claim a percentage equal to their contribution. The problem here comes if the mixed funds are used in unequal chunks to acquire other property. The long-standing rule is that established in Clayton's Case; that the money deposited first is deemed to be spent on the first property purchased. The problem with this is that if the first property becomes less valuable than the second property purchased, the first claimant loses some of their money while the second claimant is able to claim their money in its entirety. The alternate approach is the previously mentioned pari passu idea; whatever the total property is worth, the claimants get a share proportionate to their input, without assuming that the first claimant's money is tied to the first property purchased and the second claimant's money to the second property. In Barlow Clowes International v Vaughan, the Court of Appeal applied a similar set of principles, holding that the size of the contribution and the amount of time the money was part of the <b>mixed</b> <b>fund</b> were the factors to be considered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose a {{valuation}} and hedging strategy for a guaranteed minimal rate of return on a <b>mix</b> <b>fund,</b> which participates in both bonds and stocks. For the case where a fixed amount of money is invested, we show that a European put option on the <b>mix</b> <b>fund</b> replicates the cash flows of this guarantee at all times and using the arbitrage-free pricing methodology, the market value of the guarantee can be obtained explicitly. Using historical data, we show that modeling the correlation between equity and bond returns is of fundamental importance when the stochastic nature of the term structure of interest rates is taken into account. For this model we define a hedging strategy which shows how the dependency of the option on the changing yield of the bond fund can be hedged away using <b>mix</b> <b>fund</b> contracts. We also show how Monte Carlo methods can be used to analyze the case where the guarantee is given on periodically invested fixed amounts of money instead of one single payment...|$|R

40|$|Mutual funds {{underwent}} some {{rapid development}} during 2008 - 2011, this was {{indicated by the}} escalation {{of a number of}} NAB and its inclusion units value. However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each mutual funds and to compare efficiency between stock mutual funds and fixed-income mutual funds, stock mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual funds and protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> and protected mutual funds, fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> and fixed-income mutual funds and protected mutual funds. There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> twenty-one <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds,</b> and nine protected mutual funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income mutual funds and 81. 04 percent in <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds.</b> Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock mutual funds and fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> and protected mutual funds, fixed-income mutual funds and protected mutual funds, and stock mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock mutual funds and protected mutual funds, and fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of the Internet on the {{newspaper}} industry with special emphasis on quality. In pursuing this, I apply a model by Armstrong and Weeds (2007) where I compare the equilibrium outcomes when the competing newspapers are characterized by a <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime (e. g., printed newspapers) versus a pure advertising funding regime (online newspapers). Because costly investment in higher quality can be translated into higher prices to the consumer in the <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime, whereas this is not possible in a pure advertising regime, quality will, in this modelling environment, be higher for printed newspapers than for online newspapers. On the other hand, online newspapers will respond to more fierce competition by increasing quality, while printed newspapers will reduce price and keep quality unchanged. However, there are several limitations to the model. Perhaps most importantly, due to different reading behavior for online news relative to printed newspapers, online advertising has proven less effective compared to its printed counterpart. Hence, advertising revenues per reader is lower in online newspapers than in printed newspapers. Since the gain in advertising revenues by attracting more readers following an increase in quality is small, online newspapers will have weaker incentives to invest in costly quality. I also investigate how news diversity may be affected by going from a <b>mixed</b> <b>funding</b> regime to a pure advertising regime. It is clear that for a fixed quality level, online newspapers will have incentives to differentiate themselves minimally from their competitors. Printed newspaper (<b>mixed</b> <b>funding)</b> on the other hand will differentiate themselves to a larger degree as differentiation allows for setting higher prices. However, changing the assumptions, such as endogenous quality and allowing for more newspapers, may give different results. The main conclusion of this thesis is that news quality, measured as costly news production (e. g., ratio of self-produced content, use of multiple sources, investigative journalism), is lower online than in printed newspapers. An implication of this may be a reduction in positive externalities provided by quality news production...|$|R
40|$|Mutual fund is an {{alternative}} of investment that theoretically provided some advantage so that it expected to give maximum return with adjusted risk for the investor. Base on that background, is the equity funds, fixed <b>funds</b> and <b>mixed</b> <b>funds</b> better than benchmark return and which mutual funds performance {{is the best of}} its own kind. This research is using secondary data that published by Bapepam, BEI and BI. Research sample chose by using purpose sampling method, which by criteria that mutual fund operates during January 2005 until December 2009. According to those criteria, the number of sample that examined is 7 equity funds, 7 fixed <b>funds</b> and 7 <b>mixed</b> <b>funds</b> so, all 21 mutual funds. The measure of those mutual funds and benchmark performances is using Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen and M 2 method. Hypothesis tested by using two rates comparison test (independent sample t-test) by using SPSS version 16. This result of the research shows that the performances of mutual funds is superior than benchmark performances, but not significantly. The consideration of performances with Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen and M 2 method produced Danamas Pasti (fixed funds), Schroder Dana Prestasi (<b>mixed</b> <b>funds),</b> and Bahana Dana Prima (equity funds) that have superior performances than own benchmark. The conclusion of this research is suggested to candidate of investor, in determining invest to mutual funds, choose mutual funds that will give optimum return based on Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen and M 2 method...|$|R
50|$|Tracing ordinarily {{facilitates}} {{an equitable}} remedy, and {{is subject to}} the usual limitations and bars on equitable remedies in common law countries. In many common law countries, there are two concurrent processes, tracing at common law and tracing in equity. However, because the right to trace at common law is so circumscribed, the equitable process is almost universally relied upon, as equitable tracing can be performed into a <b>mixed</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{general rule}} for tracing is that [...] "If a man mixes trust funds with his own, the whole {{will be treated}} as trust property, except so far as he {{may be able to}} {{distinguish}} what is his own." [...] This should be determined by the court on a balance of probabilities. In this case, the banks and receivers had acted in good faith, even though they might have properly sought legal advice about whether there was a proprietary interest in the <b>mixed</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Court {{also held}} {{that in the}} case of a mixture of trust funds with the trustee's own money, only an {{equitable}} lien would be available as a remedy. This has since been overruled by Foskett v McKeown 2001 1 AC 102, where the House of Lords held that the beneficiary has the option of choosing an equitable lien or a constructive trust in the case of a <b>mixed</b> <b>fund.</b> A constructive trust would allow a claim in the new asset in proportion to the contribution of the beneficiary's trust fund.|$|E
