25|$|In the {{mathematical}} formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) {{is associated with}} a <b>mathematical</b> <b>operator.</b> The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable, i.e. it is possible to observe a particle with a momentum of 1kgm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1kgm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an eigenstate) with eigenvalue 1kgm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well-defined value of momentum of 1kgm/s, with no quantum uncertainty. If its momentum were measured, the result is guaranteed to be 1kgm/s.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of MOOSE at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), beginning in May 2008, {{has resulted in}} a unique approach to computational engineering that combines computer science with a strong underlying mathematical description in a unique way that allows scientists and engineers to develop engineering simulation tools in a fraction of the time previously required. The heart of MOOSE is the Kernel. A Kernel is a “piece” of physics. To add new physics to an application built using MOOSE, all that is required is to supply a new Kernel that describes the discrete form of the equation. It’s usually convenient to think of a Kernel as a <b>mathematical</b> <b>operator,</b> such as a Laplacian or a convection term in a partial differential equation (PDE). Kernels may be swapped or coupled together to achieve different application goals. These Kernels, which now number in the hundreds, allow a scientist or engineer to develop an application rapidly.|$|E

In computational verb theory, adverbs are modeled as <b>mathematical</b> <b>operators</b> acting upon computational verbs. The relations between verbs and adverbs {{can result in}} many kinds of <b>mathematical</b> <b>operators</b> in different contexts. In this paper, the adverb “as well as ” was modeled as modifiers of computa-tional verbs and its effects of modifying the evolving functions of computational verbs were studied.
