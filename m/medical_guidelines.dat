25|$|Vitamin A, or retinol, is {{the sole}} vitamin which is {{embryotoxic}} even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the retinoic acid, {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. <b>Medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E

Such documents have been in use for thousands of years during the entire history of medicine. However, in contrast to previous approaches, which were often based on tradition or authority, modern <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> are based on an examination of current evidence within the paradigm of evidence-based medicine. They usually include summarized consensus statements on best practice in healthcare.

40|$|Abstract:- The correct {{manipulation}} of semantic information {{is essential for}} {{the development and implementation of}} <b>medical</b> <b>guideline</b> server. This is a knowledge based information system for computeraided processing of clinical practice guidelines. In this study the following core functions are involved in the data processing of guideline server: (1) information transfer from other hospital information systems, (2) knowledge processing and (3) reporting functions. An execution engine is developed for guideline knowledge processing by our group. The ontological structures of the knowledge are the results of a knowledge engineering process. Additionally, the terminological standardization by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is integrated into the execution engine. The applied methodical approach for the ontology development is explained as a part of the knowledge engineering process. The developed ontological structures are used as interface descriptions for data and information transfer from electronic health record (e. g. test for plausibility) as well as for report generation and documentation (i. e. generation and explanation of terms and term sequences). The developed concepts are presented in this paper.
