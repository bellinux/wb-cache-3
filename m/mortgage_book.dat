40|$|Robert S. Weise, of {{the history}} {{department}} at Eastern Kentucky University, has provided a counterbalance to the standard emphasis upon outsiders exploitation of the mineral resource of Appalachian Kentucky. Focusing on the aspirations of residents in Floyd County, he traces the economic development from pre Civil War agricultural localism to the corporate mining structure of the twentieth century. His account rests upon creative use of census returns and county court files of land deeds, tax records, <b>mortgage</b> <b>books,</b> and case documents, personalized by reference to business correspondence of Walter Scott Harkins, Prestonburg lawyer, banker, and regional promoter, as found in the manuscript collection of the University of Kentucky library. The volume provides 28 statistical tables of agricultural, population, tax assessment, and mortgage data; 52 pages of footnotes; and 19 pages of bibliography the last compilation offering much more than is directly applicable to his narrative, but useful as an excellent survey of recent interpretive literature on Appalachia and the New South. ...|$|R

5000|$|Through {{the early}} deed and <b>mortgage</b> <b>books,</b> it is {{possible}} to pinpoint the time the Bronsons built their home in Palatka and took up residence there. In September 1852 Bronson is referred to as a resident of St. Augustine, Florida, whereas in the following March he is listed as a resident of Palatka. Thus we can assume that in 1853 the Bronsons decided to make Palatka their home, as in that year they also marked off 10 acres of land along the St. Johns River which they named Sunny Point. A mortgage record dated March 3, 1854 notes Sunny point as [...] "Being the point of ground upon which said Bronson is now building and cultivating grounds." [...] Sunny Point was removed from the mortgage on the [...] "Palatka Tract" [...] on October 16, 1854, being lands [...] "set apart by the said Bronson for his own residence, and on which he has lately erected a dwelling house and other buildings." [...] Most likely, the Bronsons spent the winter of 1854 in their new home.|$|R
