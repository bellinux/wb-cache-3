40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the effects}} of modulated periodic perpendicular magnetic fields on the electronic states and optical absorption spectrum in a monolayer black phosphorus (phosphorene). We demonstrate that different phosphorene <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> (PMS) orientations can give rise to distinct energy spectra, i. e., tuning the intrinsic electronic anisotropy. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) will develop a spin-splitting energy dispersion in this phosphorene magnetic supperlattice. Anisotropic momentum-dependent carrier distributions along/perpendicular to the magnetic strips are demonstrated, and the manipulations of these exotic properties by tuning superlattice geometry, magnetic field and the RSOC term (via an external electric field) are addressed systematically. Accordingly, we find bright-to-dark transitions in the ground state electron-hole pairs transition rate spectrum and PMS orientation dependent anisotropic optical absorption spectrum. This feature offers us a practical way to modulate the electronic anisotropy in phosphorene by <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> configurations and detect these modulation capability by using the optical technique.

40|$|Critical {{relaxation}} from a low-temperature fully ordered {{state of}} Fe 2 /V 13 iron-vanadium <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> models {{has been studied}} using the method of short-time dynamics. Systems with three variants of the ratio R of inter- to intralayer exchange coupling have been considered. Particles with N = 262144 spins have been simulated with periodic boundary conditions. Calculations have been performed using the standard Metropolis algorithm of the Monte Carlo method. The static critical exponents of magnetization and correlation radius, {{as well as the}} dynamic critical exponent, have been calculated for three R values. It is established that a small decrease in the exchange ratio (from R = 1. 0 to 0. 8) does not significantly influence the character of the short-time dynamics in the models studied. A further significant decrease in this ratio (to R = 0. 01), for which a transition from three-dimensional to quasi-twodimensional magnetism is possible, leads to significant changes in the dynamic behavior of iron-vanadium <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> models.

40|$|Abstract. - Using {{the exact}} two-propagating-modes {{solutions}} for electrons in quasi- 2 D semiconductor wave-guide, under sectionally constant magnetic fields and spin-orbit interactions, it is explicitly {{shown that the}} Fano-like resonances and antiresonances lead to sudden suppressions and enhancements of T↑, ↑ and T↓,↓, {{as well as of}} the spin-transition probability T↓,↑. Our calculations show that when the magnetic-field-tilting angle θH is increased, the spin-field interaction becomes the most significant mechanism for the spin transitions in <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattices.</b> Taking advantage of these spin-transport effects, simple and efficient spin-inverter devices are proposed. To better visualize the relative influence of the specific semiconductor properties on the device performance and device characteristics, we consider two <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattices</b> based on semiconductors having entirely different Landè g factor: GaAs and InSb. Although slightly more efficient spin-inversion devices are obtained for the GaAs semiconductor, InSb requires lower magnetic fields and its efficiency can be close to 80 %.

40|$|The 4 p {{states in}} {{transition}} metals and their compounds usually play minor roles on their physical quantities. Recent development of resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) at the K-edge of transition metals, however, casts {{light on the}} 4 p states, because the signals on orbital and <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> spots are {{brought about by the}} modulation in the 4 p states. The 4 p states are extending in solids and thereby sensitive to electronic states at neighboring sites. This characteristic determines the mechanism of RXS that the intensity on the orbital superlattice spots are mainly generated by the lattice distortion and those on <b>magnetic</b> <b>superlattice</b> spots by the coupling of the 4 p states with the orbital polarization in the 3 d states at neighboring sites. Taking up typical examples for orbital and magnetic RXS, we demonstrate these mechanisms {{on the basis of the}} band structure calculation. Finally, we study the MCD spectra at the K-edge, demonstrating that the same mechanism as the magnetic RXS is working. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Physica Scripta (comment...|$|E
