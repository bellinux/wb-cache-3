The ratings for the series premiere were 1.11 million, a record for a Showtime series premiere that was not beaten until the premiere of Shameless seven years later.|$|E

These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to <b>me,</b> <b>had</b> I not resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|The puppets {{were made}} up of more than 30 {{individual}} components, {{the most important of}} which was the solenoid that synchronised lip movements with the characters' pre-recorded dialogue. This device was positioned inside the head unit; consequently, torsos and limbs appeared relatively small. The puppets' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown, who preferred the Thunderbirds marionettes over the accurately-proportioned ones that first appeared in Captain Scarlet: [...] "The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them... Even some of the more normal-looking faces, such as Scott and Jeff, for <b>me</b> <b>had</b> more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards." [...] Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets' still being [...] "very much caricatures", since it made them [...] "more lovable and appealing...

In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole , who had been all over <b>me,</b> <b>had</b> difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. [...] " [...] it's a funny bunch of people", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV..." [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. [...] "You can't do anything {{for the first time at}} this point", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". [...] "I gotta say, this was the most fun I ever had working on an episode", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "Everyone but <b>me</b> <b>had</b> stories to tell [...] There would be about four hours of recollection before any rewriting happened." ...|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for <b>me,</b> <b>had</b> a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack.

The {{magazine}} listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, {{as one of its}} favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor in Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game [...] "may have taught me how to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other and clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that [...] "Ninja Gaiden was about as cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like <b>me,</b> <b>had</b> worn out their VHS copies of Enter the Ninja". In a July2011 issue, Retro Gamer listed the game's opening {{as one of the most}} popular ones at the time. The magazine noted how its usage of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it [...] "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.|$|E
