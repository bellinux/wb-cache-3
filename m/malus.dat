5|$|The {{apple tree}} (<b>Malus</b> pumila, {{commonly}} and erroneously called <b>Malus</b> domestica) is a deciduous {{tree in the}} rose family {{best known for its}} sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus <b>Malus.</b> The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, <b>Malus</b> sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} <b>Malus</b> pumila was <b>Malus</b> sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period of}} time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with <b>Malus</b> sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor <b>Malus</b> sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E

Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon <b>Malus.</b> When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts <b>Malus,</b> whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt.

The apple tree was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated, and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years.

This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that <b>Malus</b> sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
30|$|Controlling the {{polarisation}} {{states of}} light forms {{an important part}} of classical optics. Remarkably, the journey to understand and exploit polarisation states of light waves started in the very early days of classical optics, as exemplified by <b>Malus’s</b> law, and the discovery of birefringent effects in calcite and sodium chloride crystals. Even today, in modern photonics, it is just as important to control both linear and circular polarisation states, particularly where an exact and subtle control of light waves has led to a variety of applications and new areas of research. Unsurprisingly, considerable progress has been made, particularly as many exciting new ideas are being proposed in association with recently emergent fields of metamaterials and nanoplasmonics.|$|R

In addition to local causality, the model respects at least seven other conceptual and operational requirements, arising either from the predictions of quantum mechanics or the premises of Bell’s theorem, including the <b>Malus’s</b> law for sequential spin measurements.

The class of a policy-holder in a given year is determined {{on the basis of the}} class of the previous year and on the number of claims reported in that year.

Else, the policy-holder may stay in the same class or gets <b>maluses</b> (penalized) by being shifted to a class with higher premium rates. The movement between classes is modeled as a discrete time Markov chain which is dependent on the claim process which is also assumed to be Markovian. However, the transition matrix of the claim process is assumed unknown and random. In this paper, we propose recursive filters for a related transition matrix. We also provide a formula to predict claims m years into the future. Finally, parameters estimation of the transition matrix governing the movement between classes are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Stochastic optics may be {{considered}} as simply a local realistic interpretation of quantum optics and, in this sense, it {{is a first step}} in the reinterpretation of the whole of quantum theory. However, as {{it is not possible to}} interpret all the details of quantum theory in a local realistic manner, as shown by Bell’s theorem, minor changes are introduced in the formalism with the consequence that the new theory makes different predictions in some special cases. In stochastic optics, the quantum-operator formalism is simply considered a formal way of dealing with stochastic fields. In particular, the quantum zero point is taken as a real random electromagnetic radiation filling the whole of space. This radiation noise has the same nature as light signals, the only difference being the greater intensity of the latter. We assume that photon detectors have an intensity threshold just above the level of the noise, thus detecting only signals. Transmission of radiation through polarizers follows <b>Malus’s</b> law, but the interplay of signal and noise leads quite naturally to the prediction that the detection probability of some signals is enhanced, which is known to be a necessary condition for the violation of the empirically tested Bell inequalities. In our view, correlated photon pairs are pairs of light signals supercorrelated in polarization, in the sense that, as well as the signal, the accompanying noise is also correlated. Thus stochastic optics allows predictions for the empirical correlations very close, but not identical, to the quantum ones. The theory is applied to the analysis of all experiments designed to test the Bell inequalities by measuring polarization correlations of photon pairs. The predictions agree with quantum optics and experiments within statistical errors, except for the Holt-Pipkin experiment. In this case, the experimental results agree with stochastic optical predictions within two standard deviations while violating quantum optics by four...|$|R
40|$|Polarisation {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} method in the analysis of light reflection in computer vision. It {{plays an important role in}} separating reflectance components using cross polarisation settings. Some polarisation based methods have also been presented in the literature for surface orientation estimation, where the incident light is unpolarised. This thesis aims at exploiting the polarising properties of surface reflection for computer vision applications. In particular, we focus on developing a framework for measuring the shape and reflectance information based on polarisation data. The polarised images are acquired using simple and low-cost devices, and the estimates are satisfactory compared with other surface characteristic methods such as shape from shading and stereo approaches. Statistical methods are also used to aid the computations, such as blind source separation (BSS), mutual information estimation, the iterated conditional modes method, etc. Chapter 2 surveys the related literature in the fields of polarisation, reflectance function analysis, shape recovery, and pattern recognition. We also discuss other shape recovery techniques, such as shape from shading, photometric stereo, and geometric stereo. We make comparisons between these approaches to show their advantages and drawbacks. In Chapter 3, we introduce the method of BSS, and show how to incorporate it into polarisation state estimation. The traditional method of using polarisation models for shape recovery and polarisation state estimation usually requires more than three images, normally 10 or more pictures in different polarisation angles. The proposed method solves these problems, and provides a robust way to measure polarisation state and refractive index information using only three images, and without the need to have polarisation angle information. We also demonstrate in the experimental section that the estimates using the proposed method offer significant improvements over existing polarisation based approaches. In Chapter 4, we extend the work in the Chapter 3 in a number of ways. Firstly, we present detailed review of the Fresnel theory in polarisation vision, and propose a novel polarisation model which considers both diffuse and specular reflections. Secondly, we develop a new novel criterion functions to be used in the Chapter 3, which improves its robustness and accuracy. In Chapter 5, we also explore the shape recovery method using the polarised light. When the polarised light is transmitted through the polariser, it becomes fully polarised. The specular reflection part can be fully eliminated using the setting of "cross-polarisation". In this case the methodology is changed accordingly. This leads us to develop a new framework which firstly uses BSS for reflectance component separation, and then applies a polarisation model built specifically for this case. The polarisation model is based on Fresnel equation and <b>Malus's</b> law, which describes the reflection of polarised light when transmitting through the polariser in front of the viewer. It is also noted that the proposed framework reduces the noise in the zenith angle estimate, which we demonstrate in the experiments. In Chapter 6 we consider an alternative way to estimate shape and reflectance properties using polarised light. Using the separated diffuse and specular reflection components obtained in Chapter 5, we use parametric reflectance models, that relate the reflectance intensity with the zenith angle when the parameter values are given. The reflectance models are only applied for either diffuse or specular reflections, and the two zenith angle estimates from the two components should be identical as they describe the same object. We use mutual information estimation and Newton's method to find their similarities and their parameter values measured by model fitting. The two estimates then are combined using a mixture model. We choose six reflectance models and compare their performance in this framework...|$|R

25|$|By 1845, it {{was known}} through the work of Fresnel, <b>Malus,</b> and others that {{different}} materials are able to modify the direction of polarization of light when appropriately oriented, making polarized light a very powerful tool to investigate the properties of transparent materials. Faraday firmly believed that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon, and as such should be affected by electromagnetic forces. He spent considerable effort looking for evidence of electric forces affecting the polarization of light through what are now known as electro-optic effects, starting with decomposing electrolytes. However, his experimental methods were not sensitive enough, and the effect was only measured thirty years later by John Kerr.|$|E
25|$|Light {{reflected}} by shiny transparent materials is {{partly or fully}} polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was this effect that allowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis <b>Malus</b> to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarization occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarizing filters to darken the sky in photographs. Optical polarization is principally of importance in chemistry due to circular dichroism and optical rotation ("circular birefringence") exhibited by optically active (chiral) molecules.|$|E
25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and Chenopodium album. In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, <b>Malus</b> sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, Przewalski horses experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E
