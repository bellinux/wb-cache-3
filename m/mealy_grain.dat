Many of the men felt that Captain Downes was doing this for the [...] "good of the Captain" [...] and wondered when they would be used for the purpose they joined the Navy for rather than for the Captain's personal enrichment.|$|E
40|$|The rhea logical {{behaviour}} of two wheat varieties (Triticum durum), cultivated {{at different}} sites, was studied by INSTRON* {{as a function}} of water content. Patterns of crushed grains were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The apparent modulus of elasticity of the wheat grains was apparently re 1 a ted to their vitreosity. The <b>mealy</b> <b>grain</b> generally had an apparent modulus of elasticity lower than that of the vitreous one and the modulus appeared {{to be related to the}} air spaces in mealy endosperm. Humidification favoured the conversion of vitreous endosperm to the mealy state. Grain morphology and particularly the kernel crease played an important role during grain crushing...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenetic (Pinb-D 1 alleles) and {{environment}} (through vitreousness) have important effects on bread wheat milling behavior. SKCS optimal values corresponding to soft vitreous or hard <b>mealy</b> <b>grains</b> were defined {{to obtain the}} highest total flour yield. Near-isogenic lines of bread wheat that differ in hardness, due to distinct puroindoline-b alleles (the wild type, Pinb-D 1 a, or the mutated forms, Pinb-D 1 b or Pinb-D 1 d), were grown in different environments and under two nitrogen fertilization levels, to study genetic {{and environment}}al effects on milling behavior. Milling tests used a prototype mill, equipped with two break steps, one sizing step, and two reduction steps, and this enabled 21 individual or aggregated milling fractions to be collected. Four current grain characters, thousand grain weight, test weight, grain diameter, and protein content, were measured, and three characters known to influence grain mechanical resistance, NIRS hardness, SKCS hardness index, and grain vitreousness (a character affecting the grain mechanical behavior but generally not studied). As expected, the wild type or mutated forms of Pinb-D 1 alleles led to contrasted milling behavior: soft genotypes produced high quantities of break flour and low quantities of reduction flour, whereas reverse quantities were observed for hard genotypes. This different milling behavior had only a moderate influence on total flour production. NIRS hardness and vitreousness were, respectively, {{the most important and}} the second most important grain characters to explain milling behavior. However, contrary to NIRS hardness, vitreousness was only involved in endosperm reduction and not in the separation between the starchy endosperm and the outer layers. The highest flour yields were obtained for SKCS values comprised between 30 and 50, which corresponded either to soft vitreous or hard <b>mealy</b> <b>grains.</b> Prediction equations were defined and showed a good accuracy estimating break and reduction flours portions, but should be used more cautiously for total flour...|$|R
50|$|Lepraria is a genus of leprose crustose lichens {{that grows}} on its {{substrate}} like patches of granular, caked up, <b>mealy</b> dust <b>grains.</b> Members {{of the genus}} are commonly called dust lichens. The main vegetative body (thallus) is made of patches of soredia (little balls of algae wrapped in fungus). There are no known mechaisms for sexual reproduction, yet members of the genus continue to speciate. Some species can form marginal lobes and appear squamulose.|$|R
60|$|So we went, {{followed}} by our hungry clients, and, {{in addition to}} many more things, to our delight found a great store of rice, <b>mealies</b> and other <b>grain,</b> some of which was ground into meal. Of this we served out an ample supply together with salt, and soon the cooking pots were full of porridge. My word! how those poor creatures did eat, nor, although {{it was necessary to}} be careful, could we find it in our hearts to stint them of the first full meal that had passed their lips after weeks of starvation. When at length they were satisfied we addressed them, thanking them for their bravery, telling them that they were free and asking what they meant to do.|$|R

Introduction: The terms “hard” and “soft” as commonly applied to wheats, are probably rather loosely used, with but a general and indefinite meaning. Certain red wheats are commonly referred to as hard, others as soft. On closer investigation it is foud, as does not seem at all unreasonable, that the degree of hardness varies in different varieties, in the same variety under different conditions, and in the grains of the same variety under any one condition. The common indication of hardness is found in the color of the grain. This varies in the red wheats from a clear reddish amber to an opaque red, yellow or whitish, the clear grain being “hard”, the others “soft”. By cutting the grains transversely with a knife the clear ones are found to hard and flinty, while the others are soft, white, and <b>mealy.</b> The <b>grains</b> of certain varieties may be characteristically of one type or the other, but in any given variety under ordinary conditions it is possible to select a perfect series of kernels showing all degrees from the entirely clear and flinty to the opaque and mealy. It may be and has been repeatedly shown that the flinty grains are considerably harder than the others. For instance in the following experiment the kernels of a certain sample which were entirely flinty or nearly so, were found to be 23. 6 per cent harder than those which were not all, or only slightly flinty...|$|R
