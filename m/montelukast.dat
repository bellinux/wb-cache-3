25|$|Related {{compounds}} include <b>montelukast</b> (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate). These two compounds are leukotriene receptor antagonists which {{block the}} action of specific leukotrienes, while zileuton inhibits leukotriene formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Montelukast,</b> a {{medicine}} {{used for the}} treatment of allergies and asthma, was added to the free medication program in February 2017. 90-day supplies of 4- or 5-mg chewable tablets for children, or 10-mg oral tablets for adults, are available with a doctor's prescription.|$|E
25|$|The {{correction}} of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, {{of the breast}} implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external ultrasonic therapy, leukotriene pathway inhibitors such as zafirlukast (Accolate) or <b>montelukast</b> (Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT).|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, <b>montelukast,</b> nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|The three cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent bronchoconstrictors, increasers of {{vascular}} permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulators of mucus secretion {{that are}} {{released from the}} lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens. They play a pathophysiological role in diverse types of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs that block their activation of the CYSLTR1 receptor viz., <b>montelukast,</b> zafirlukast, and pranlukast, are used clinically as maintenance treatment for allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). When combined with antihistamine drug therapy, they also appear useful for treating urticarial diseases such as hives.|$|E
2500|$|Corticosteroids are the {{mainstay}} of therapy with a 90% response rate in some studies. Appropriate duration of steroid treatment is unknown and relapse often necessitates long term treatment. Various steroid sparing agents e.g. sodium cromoglycate (a stabilizer of mast cell membranes), ketotifen (an antihistamine), and <b>montelukast</b> (a selective, competitive leukotriene receptor antagonist) have been proposed, centering on an allergic hypothesis, with mixed results. [...] An elimination diet may be successful if {{a limited number of}} food allergies are identified.|$|E
2500|$|Type 1 {{hypersensitivity}} includes common immune {{disorders such as}} asthma, {{allergic rhinitis}} (hay fever), eczema, urticaria (hives) and anaphylaxis. These reactions all involve IgE antibodies, which require a Th2 response during helper T cell development. Preventive treatments, such as corticosteroids and <b>montelukast,</b> focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. It's {{important to note that}} the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity [...] "types" [...] does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the [...] "response" [...] in the Th model.|$|E
50|$|<b>Montelukast</b> is {{administered}} as <b>montelukast</b> sodium, with 5.2mg of <b>montelukast</b> sodium being equivalent to 5mg of <b>montelukast.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Montelukast</b> (trade name Singulair) is a {{leukotriene}} receptor antagonist (LTRA) {{used for}} the maintenance treatment of asthma and to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. <b>Montelukast</b> comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, flash tablet and granules to take by mouth. <b>Montelukast</b> is usually taken once a day with or without food. [...] <b>Montelukast</b> is a CysLT1 antagonist; it blocks the action of leukotriene D4 (and secondary ligands LTC4 and LTE4) on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene and results in less inflammation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Montelukast,</b> {{unlike many}} drugs, has very few drug-drug interactions. This {{is due to}} the lack of off-target {{affinity}} towards other targets in the body where it might exert an effect. However, it is important to note that <b>montelukast</b> is an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C8. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the combination of <b>montelukast</b> with a CYP2C8 substrate (e.g. amodiaquine, an anti-malarial drug) could increase the plasma concentrations of the substrate.|$|E

50|$|GPR99 is {{inhibited}} by <b>montelukast,</b> {{a well-known}} and clinically useful inhibitor of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1); this drug binds to CysLTR1 thereby blocking the binding and action of LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4. It {{is presumed to}} act similarly to block the actins of these cystienyl leukotrienes on GPR99. It is not known if other CysLTR1 inhibitors (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Clinical significance) can mimic <b>montelukast</b> in blocking GPR99.|$|E

50|$|Ludwig Aigner from Paracelsus Medical University in Austria {{presented}} findings at the October 2015 {{meeting of}} the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago which showed that administration of <b>Montelukast</b> to older rats rejuvenated their brains, returning the same functionality as that of young rats. Human trials are planned, starting with Parkinsons patients.

50|$|The usual dose of <b>Montelukast</b> {{in adults}} and {{teenagers}} is one 10 mg tablet taken orally a day. In children 6 to 14 {{years of age}} the usual dosage is one 5 mg chewable tablet a day.|$|E
