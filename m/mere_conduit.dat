Sovereignty was presumed to rest solely upon the people, with Bảo Đại being a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit.</b> As a result, the referendum itself was within the law. Diệm had not been elected to his post, so he saw the referendum {{as an opportunity to}} rebuff opponents, who claimed that he was undemocratic and autocratic. The event also gave Diệm an opportunity to boost his prestige by defeating Bảo Đại in a head-to-head contest. It was previously agreed that a National Assembly would be elected first, but Diệm went ahead with the plebiscite, which meant that he would have total power if he deposed Bảo Đại before a legislature was formed.|$|E
60|$|It {{was five}} o'clock before Miltoun left the Bridge, and passed, like an exile, before {{the gates of}} Church and State, {{on his way to}} his uncle's Club. He stopped to {{telegraph}} to Audrey the time he would be coming to-morrow afternoon; and on leaving the Post-Office, noticed in the window of the adjoining shop some reproductions of old Italian masterpieces, amongst them one of Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus.' He had never seen that picture; and, remembering that she had told him it was her favourite, he stopped to look at it. Averagely well versed in such matters, as became one of his caste, Miltoun had not the power of letting a work of art insidiously steal the private self from his soul, and replace it with the self of all the world; and he examined this far-famed presentment of the heathen goddess with aloofness, even irritation. The drawing of the body seemed to him crude, the whole picture a little flat and Early; he did not like the figure of the Flora. The golden serenity, and tenderness, of which she had spoken, left him cold. Then he found himself looking at the face, and slowly, but with uncanny certainty, began to feel that he was looking at the face of Audrey herself. The hair was golden and different, the eyes grey and different, the mouth a little fuller; yet--it was her face; the same oval shape, the same far-apart, arched brows, the same strangely tender, elusive spirit. And, as though offended, he turned and walked on. In the window of that little shop was the effigy of her for whom he had bartered away his life--the incarnation of passive and entwining love, that gentle creature, who had given herself to him so utterly, for whom love, and the flowers, and trees, and birds, music, the sky, and the quick-flowing streams, were all-sufficing; and who, like the goddess in the picture, seemed wondering at her own existence. He had a sudden glimpse of understanding, strange indeed in one who had so little power of seeing into others' hearts: Ought she ever to have been born into a world like this? But the flash of insight yielded quickly to that sickening consciousness of his own position, which never left him now. Whatever else he did, he must get rid of that malaise! But what could he do in that coming life? Write books? What sort of books could he write? Only such as expressed his views of citizenship, his political and social beliefs. As well remain sitting and speaking beneath those towers! He could never join the happy band of artists, those soft and indeterminate spirits, for whom barriers had no meaning, content-to understand, interpret, and create. What should he be doing in that galley? The thought was inconceivable. A career at the Bar--yes, he might take that up; but to what end? To become a judge! As well continue to sit beneath those towers! Too late for diplomacy. Too late for the Army; besides, he had not the faintest taste for military glory. Bury himself in the country like Uncle Dennis, and administer one of his father's estates? It would be death. Go amongst the poor? For a moment he thought he had found a new vocation. But in what capacity--to order their lives, when he himself could not order his own; or, as a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> pipe for money, when he believed that charity was rotting the nation to its core? At the head of every avenue stood an angel or devil with drawn sword. And then there came to him another thought. Since he was being cast forth from Church and State, could he not play the fallen spirit like a man--be Lucifer, and destroy! And instinctively he at once saw himself returning to those towers, and beneath them crossing the floor; joining the revolutionaries, the Radicals, the freethinkers, scourging his present Party, the party of authority and institutions. The idea struck him as supremely comic, and he laughed out loud in the street....|$|E

40|$|Microblogs, epitomized by Twitter in the West and Weibo in China, have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{over the past}} few years. There {{have been a number of}} optimistic accounts about their potential to stimulate political activism and social change, juxtaposed with suggestions that their networks are too weak and that they are too easily censored for such change to occur. Yet, in this debate, little attention has been paid to the medium itself; microblogs have too often been treated as <b>mere</b> <b>conduits</b> for information, and the practical and aesthetic experience of microblogging has been marginalized. This article addresses this imbalance in two ways. First, it argues that the microblog is a distinctive medium with special potential for political communication. It applies Rancière’s ‘politics of aesthetics’ and Baudrillard’s ‘private telematics’ to microblogs, suggesting that the particularly immersive quality of microblogs provides new and distinct opportunities for the promotion of opinions and social movements. Second, it argues that by allowing, re-modelling, monitoring and censoring the Weibo service, the Chinese party-state, acting collaboratively with the key microblog companies and the market as a whole, is consciously manipulating the medium of the microblog to reduce the risk of activism, controversial use, and network formation. Thus, the medium of Weibo differs from other microblogs – of which Twitter is the key example – in several important ways, each of which, the article argues, are intended to maximize the cacophonous spectacle of entertainment and to minimize reasoned discussion and debate. Furthermore, while pure censorship of information can be evaded in many ways, it is more difficult for dissenters to evade state control when it is applied to the medium itself. 32 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{infrastructure}} is the template upon which we build our inhabitations. Decisions regarding street arrangements, block sizes, and larger scale infrastructure design for example have an enduring and profound affect {{on the quality}} of our spatial environments. The conceptual framework we apply when generating and subsequently manipulating this template sets the parameters by which it is judged. By convention, transport {{infrastructure is}} considered a purely technical undertaking, within which designers rarely play any meaningful part. The spaces of mobility are thus from their very genesis conceived as instrumental in nature, judged as <b>mere</b> <b>conduits</b> whose function is to join meaningful places such as work and home, fulfilling an economic imperative. Recent research has shown however that affective, symbolic factors play a greater role than instrumental considerations in modal choice of commuters, suggesting that, to the end user at least, transport possesses a value beyond simple utility. Indeed, mobility itself is often cited as a defining characteristic of the modern world, implying a highly symbolic status. This gap between the instrumental conceptual framework we apply to transport infrastructure and the symbolically loaded experience of mobility is an opportunity for design to enrich the experience of users, framed in this research as commuters. Through investigation of the commute as a quotidian, secular ritual greater consideration is given to extra-economic value in the spaces of transport infrastructure. This research analyses the nature and function of ritual in contemporary secular life and argues for the applicability of a ritual framework for understanding value in transport infrastructure. The spatial implications of ritual (defined as symbol + action and exhibiting the key sociocultural functions of mnemonic and liminality) are explored through the design of a harbour ferry terminal for Wellington...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} of policy {{initiatives}} of an Australian state government shows how sub-national governments can use ideas as drivers for national agendas to reinforce their identity as states and promote themselves as proponents of reform initiatives in government generally. Federations of strong central governments and subordinate sub-national governments are constantly adjusting {{the balance of power}} between them. Sub-national governments such as states or provinces, which make up a middle tier of government, face a loss of independence when confronted by federal government 'vertical' fiscal control and international economic, trade and cultural pressures that derogate from their residual powers. Local government, as a third tier, also competes for attention and relevance as the appropriate service provider and manager of available resources. A federal government, citing demands for efficiency, can choose to bypass a subnational government, deal directly with local government and undermine the public perception of the middle tier. Sub-national governments may thus be seen as <b>mere</b> <b>conduits</b> – and not necessarily the preferred conduits – between distant central authorities and citizens. Yet unless federations move to a unitary system, sub-national governments must be accommodated as active partners in policy development and service delivery – or risk becoming expensive 'shells'. In Australia, the role of the states in recasting themselves as active participants in national policy arenas has been variously described as collaborative or competitive federalism. The states use collaboration and competition to complement one another as they propose policy resolutions in response to changing demands from citizens, other tiers of government, and external influences arising from globalization and concerns about terrorism and national security. This study focuses on Victoria, the second largest Australian state by population. It examines how Victoria handles ideas-driven policy, drawing widely on initiatives and people in other governments and in the private sector. Victoria is carving out a role in entrepreneurial policy leadership through initiatives under the National Reform Agenda, which takes the economic and structural reforms of the 1990 s and moves them forward into areas of human capital, health, education, infrastructure and further rounds of regulatory reform. Where the state's power is in question or weakened, it responds with claims for the priority of its policy ideas. Three examples of ideas-driven policy are examined: national water policy, strategies to combat rises in type 2 diabetes, and strategies to improve numeracy and literacy among school children. Competing political powers, professional authorities, organised interests and proponents of ideas strive for national influence on each issue. Ideas-based proposals are central to vigorous contests in managing infrastructure, health and education. How these contests are resolved may be crucial to the future of federation as a real rather than symbolic description of Australian government, and may provide lessons for federations elsewhere, and indeed for governments that, while not formally federated, comprise a multiplicity of communities and levels...|$|R
40|$|Media {{coverage}} {{is an important}} element in the foreign policy-making process (Bennett, 1994). Mermin wrote, 2 ̆ 2 It is clear that the media are players in the construction of foreign policy debate in the United States 2 ̆ 2 (1999, p. 4). Since most Americans get their information about foreign policy from the news media, 2 ̆ 7 Journalists take on one of their greatest responsibilities 2 ̆ 2 (Mermin, p. 4). Foreign policy {{coverage is}} significant because news content may affect public opinion, which may constrain or free decision makers in the policy process (Bennett). Therefore, the content the media provide to the public is worthy of examination, specifically when reporting a potential war. If the media do not provide exceptional coverage about {{the pros and cons of}} going to war, healthy democratic debate regarding the decision cannot exist among citizens. The purpose of this thesis is to examine media coverage of President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s policy towards Iraq, which includes potential military action. The foremost consideration is just how independent the media are of administration policy when reporting a potential war. This subject has been the focus of previous studies. Dorman and Livingston (1994) wrote, 2 ̆ 2 The quality of news coverage is never more important than when a society is pondering whether to wage war 2 ̆ 2 (p. 63). Indicators of this quality can be found in whether the media distance themselves from the official administration position and provide independent, critical observations of the policy or whether the media act as <b>mere</b> <b>conduits</b> for the administration 2 ̆ 7 s policy. Evidence has suggested that the media provide coverage that is supportive of government policy; numerous studies have already shown that media coverage often reflects the level of debate in government (Bennett, 1990; Entman 2 ̆ 6 Page, 1994; Mermin, 1999; Robinson, 2 (01). However, it can be argued that a balance of opposing viewpoints needs to be presented by the media to best inform the public. A diversity of viewpoints has been considered essential to initiate and maintain a healthy democratic debate among citizens, especially when reporting about a decision as grave as going to war (Bennett; Mermin). Media studies of the Gulf War cover similar ground. Entman and Page (1994) drew four main conclusions about the media coverage prior to start of the Gulf War: 1) Criticism and support of administration policy were both reported frequently; 2) Critical information was displayed less saliently and was often procedural rather than substantive; 3) Sources with more power over war policy were given more prominence in coverage; and 4) Few fundamental criticisms of administration policy appeared. Dorman and Livingston (1994) found that media coverage prior to the start of the Gulf War was lacking in historical context and was quick to adopt administration justifications for war. Iyengar and Simon (1994) determined that media coverage throughout the Gulf War was 2 ̆ 2 heavily episodic or event-oriented 2 ̆ 2 (p. 179). Each of these reports, among others, indicates that media coverage was lacking in substantial, critical analyses of administration policy and justifications. President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s policy towards Iraq is based on disarming Iraq through military force if deemed necessary. A military engagement with Iraq would be the first American military engagement since the United States led an attack in Afghanistan that began in October of 2001. However, that intervention was characterized as a manhunt for Osama bin Laden and the early stages of an ongoing, unconventional assault on the al-Quaeda terrorist network. Additionally, the unique circumstances presented by September 11 may have affected media coverage. The media may have offered less critical coverage of the American campaign in Afghanistan as a result of the September II terrorist attacks. In this respect, it is reasonable that media coverage may have been more supportive of American efforts in Afghanistan. Since more than a year has passed since the September 11 attacks, one would expect the media to now be operating in a 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 manner, providing foreign policy coverage that is not influenced or colored by those extraordinary events. A military conflict with Iraq would presumably be a conflict between nation states. As such, the use of force in Iraq would be the first traditional military engagement since the 1991 Gulf War. For these reasons, coverage of the potential war with Iraq can be considered coverage that is representative of normal coverage of a potential war. This is an important point to consider since the purpose of this study is to examine how the media cover a potential large-scale military engagement under normal conditions after September II, 200 I. The American press is an independent enterprise, free from government censorship, especially during peacetime. Therefore, the media should have every opportunity to examine all sides of an issue. Understanding the role the media assume in the post September 11 era is a critical consideration, and its importance is heightened during the preliminary stages of a military conflict...|$|R

[...] Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management, she shows Seneca's appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger, and its pathological connections. Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca's contribution to political philosophy showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics, education and notions of global citizenship and finding a basis for reform-minded education in Seneca's ideas that allows her to propose a mode of modern education which steers clear of both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition.|$|E

40|$|Communication is {{increasingly}} gaining {{the status of}} a valuable, if not Indispensable management tool, together with the obligations that such status carries. Compared with about ten years ago communication managers are no longer seen as <b>mere</b> information <b>conduits,</b> rather they act as fully fledged strategic advisers to senior managers. In common with financial management, production management and human resources management, communication is expected to contribute to the achievement of company objectives. Until recently communication was seen as the exclusive territory of the 'public relations' and 'marketing communications' departments. However, this era now seems to have come to an end, as witnessed particularly in the rise of 'new' forms of communication within such functional management domains such as 'financial management' (investor relations), 'production management' (e. g environmental communication), and 'personnel management' (labour market communication) which communicate with internal and external target groups apparently outside the scope of influence of the 'traditional' communication departments. According to Van Riel (1995) corporate communication is an all embracing framework coordinating marketing, organisational and management communication - integrating the total business. Although much has been written on the subject, no empirical study on the role and tasks of the director of corporate communications has been found. Despite an increased academic interest in organisational communication and in strategy implementation this area has received scant attention to the role of organisational communication in the process of strategy implementation and often fail to address fully the issues relating to organisational communication in diverse, dynamic and complex contemporary organisations. It {{is interesting to note that}} there is no universally accepted definition of the concept, nor a unified title for the person who holds the office (Dolphin and Fan, 2000). The role of communication is still embryonic as an established function; it is misunderstood in many organisations. One word repeated throughout this literature is 'strategic', public relations managers should provide strategic counsel, they should take part in strategy formulation, and they must be able to implement strategies. Bronn (2001) then wonders why is it, however, that so many agree that public relations are still not making it to the top management teams. This makes the task less clear cut Academics seems to be undecided about what is expected of the PR practitioner. There are a variety of different descriptions given to essentially the same task. All put different emphasis on much the same job. There can be little debate that corporate communications has become a key competitive weapon. Organisations whether in the public or private sectors can gain and sustain competitive advantage form communicating successfully with their key audiences...|$|R

The freight factoring company will then begin collecting on these invoices from the trucking company’s customers, or debtors. When a debtor sends funds to a freight factoring company, it is paying for the services rendered by the trucking company. As such, the freight factoring company is obligated to apply the funds it receives to its client’s invoices in accordance with remittance attached to the debtor’s payment. When a debtor files bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee seeks to recover as much property as possible for the bankruptcy estate. Thus, {{it is not uncommon}} for freight factoring companies to find that funds it received from a debtor may be subject to a preferential claim under Bankruptcy Code section 547 for recovery by the bankruptcy estate. However, there is a judicially created exception from recovery called the <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> defense. This Comment explores the origins of that defense, its application in cases involving banks as financial intermediaries and as payees on loans, and advocates that freight factoring companies should be viewed as mere conduits in bankruptcy preference claims...|$|E
40|$|The Electronic Commerce Directive {{sets out}} rules {{regarding}} the liability of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the European Union. Under these rules, {{three categories of}} increasing liability exist, namely being a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit,</b> caching and hosting. As a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> an ISP is not liable for damages or any criminal sanction {{as a result of}} a transmission (of content) where the ISP does not initiate the transmission, did not select the receiver of the transmission and did not select or modify the information contained in the transmission. Where an ISP is involved in caching, it is also not liable for damages or any criminal sanction resulting from the transmission of content, subject to compliance with certain rules such as not modifying the information (in the transmission), and complying with conditions on access to that information. ISPs that host content are not liable for damages or any criminal sanction as a result of the storage of illegal content unless they are aware of such content and fail to remove it. Finally the law does not impose a general obligation on ISPs to monitor any information transmitted or stored, neither is there a general obligation to actively seek out illegal activity. In the 2007 case of Sabam vs Tiscali (Scarlet) a Belgian court (of first instance) ordered an ISP (Scarlet) to filter traffic (using Audible Magic software to scan peer- 2 -peer network traffic) to prevent file sharing of unauthorised copyright material. This ruling has sparked an interesting debate regarding the limits of the protection granted to ISPs under the E-Commerce Directive, and the rights of copyright holders under the EU Copyright Directive to take action against intermediaries whose services are used to pirate copyrighted material. The debate raises wider issues related to the extent of ISP liability in general, especially in the face of new technologies that can be used for filtering, identifying and blocking illegal content. Indeed, recently, ISPs have come under increasing pressure from politicians and legislators (in the UK, Australia and Italy among other countries) with regard to blocking illegal and offensive content. In some countries such as China, ISPs are obligated by law to monitor and control transmitted content. This paper examines the current debate and the wider question of whether ISPs can or should be held liable for some kinds of illegal online activities, especially where technically feasible methods can be used to monitor and control these activities. The paper discusses the relevance and adequacy of the present law on ISP immunity, in the present climate of increasing illegal online activities and also discusses technologies that can be use by ISPs to police online activities. The paper further questions whether the present law needs to be amended in the face of new technological capabilities. Finally the paper gives recommendations for possible ways forward for the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{corporate}} portal supports {{a community of}} users on cohesively managing a shared set of resources. Such management should also include social tagging, i. e. the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize content. This task involves to know both what to tag (hence, the rendering of the resource content) and how to tag (i. e. the tagging functionality itself). Traditionally both efforts are accomplished by the same application (Flickr {{is a case in}} point). However, portals decouple these endeavours. Tagging functionality is up to the portal, but content rendering can be outsourced to third-party applications: the portlets. Portlets are Web applications that transparently render their markup through a portal. The portal is a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> for the portlet markup, being unaware of what this markup conveys. This work addresses how to make portlets tagging-aware, i. e. portlets that can be seamlessly plugged into the portal tagging infrastructure. The main challenge rests on consistency at both the back-end (i. e. use of a common structure for tagging data, e. g. a common set of tags), and the front-end (i. e. tagging interactions to be achieved seamlessly across the portal using similar rendering guidelines). Portlet events and RDFa annotations are used to meet this requirement. A running example in WebSynergy illustrates the feasibility of the approach...|$|E
40|$|Portlet {{syndication}} is {{the next}} wave following the successful use of content syn-dication in current portals. Portlets {{can be regarded as}} Web components, and the portal as the component container where portlets are aggregated to provide higher-order applications. This perspective requires a departure from how current Web portals are envisaged. The portal is no longer perceived as a set of pages but as an integrated set of Web components that are now delivered through the portal. From this perspective, the portal page now acts as a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> for portlets. Page and page navigation dilute in favor of portlet and portlet orchestration. However, the mapping from portlet orchestration (design time) to page navigation (implementa-tion time) is too tedious and error prone. For instance, the fact that the same portlet can be placed in distinct pages produces code clones that are repeated along the pages that contain this portlet. This redundancy substantiates in the first place the effort to move to model-driven development. This work uses the eXo platform as the target PSM, and the PIM is based on Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts. The paper shows how this approach accounts for portal validation/verification to be conducted earlier at the PIM level, and streamlines both design and implemen-tation of eXo portals. A running example is used throughout the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the current {{situation}} of Spanish case law on ISP liability. It starts by presenting the more salient peculiarities of the Spanish transposition of the safe harbours laid down in the E-Commerce Directive. These peculiarities relate to the knowledge requirement of the hosting safe harbour, and to the safe harbour for information location tools. The article then {{provides an overview of}} the cases decided so far with regard to each of the safe harbours. Very few cases have dealt with the <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> and the caching safe harbours, though the latter was discussed in an interesting case involving Google’s cache. Most cases relate to hosting and linking safe harbours. With regard to hosting, the article focuses particularly on the two judgments handed down by the Supreme Court that hold an open interpretation of actual knowledge, an issue where courts had so far been split. Cases involving the linking safe harbour have mainly dealt with websites offering P 2 P download links. Accordingly, the article explores the legal actions brought against these sites, which for the moment have been unsuccessful. The new legislative initiative to fight against digital piracy – the Sustainable Economy Bill – is also analyzed. After the conclusion, the article provides an Annex listing the cases that have dealt with ISP liability in Spain since the safe harbours scheme was transposed into Spanish law...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{liability}} remains {{perhaps the}} only meaningful remedy for rights owners {{when it comes to}} the widespread copyright and trademark infringement on the Internet. It is often extremely difficult and costly to reach the direct infringers. Right holders thus seek, under various theories of indirect liability, to hold liable those who provide the means that enable the violations. While trademark and copyright doctrines of secondary liability stem from the same roots in common law, they have evolved separately. Courts have applied secondary liability differently depending on whether the infringement pertains to copyright or trademark, with secondary liability construed more narrowly in trademark than in copyright. In addition, the safe harbors enacted in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) grant Internet service providers liability limitations for monetary and injunctive relief. These safe harbors apply to certain types of intermediary activities—namely, <b>mere</b> <b>conduit,</b> caching, hosting and linking. While the DMCA’s safe harbors scheme has been successful in shielding intermediaries from liability (and thus allowing new services to flourish), the statute lacks clarity and coherence, which sometimes makes the outcomes difficult to predict. Moreover, the statute’s lack of clarity may lead to unintended consequences, particularly in connection with potential abuses of the “notice and takedown” procedure. On the other hand, activities that fail to qualify for safe harbors are analyzed under the ordinary rules of secondary liability, which continue to evolve in courts...|$|E
40|$|This {{article has}} two primary goals: (a) to {{illustrate}} how a closer analysis of language can lead to fruitful insights into the activities that it helps constitute, and (b) to demonstrate {{the complexity of the}} practices that make up Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming (MMOGaming) through just such an analysis. The first goal is in response to the way we sometimes treat language in studies of activity, despite calls for more nuanced analyses (e. g., Wells, 2002), as a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> for information in which its other (so-cial, identity) functions are overlooked. The second goal is in response to the diatribes against video games in the media and their frequent dismissal as barren play. In this article, I use functional linguis-tics to unpack how a seemingly inconsequential turn of talk within the game Lineage reveals important aspects of the activity in which it is situated as well as the broader “forms of life ” enacted in the game through which members display their allegiance and identity. Before symbolic processing theory developed in the late 1950 s, psychology was dominated by the-ories of behaviorism that treated human behavior as nothing more than a direct response to envi-ronmental stimuli (SR). Symbolic processing theory later rejected this assumption, concluding that human behavior could not be explained without positing an intermediate stratum of mental processes that occur between input (stimuli from the environment) and output (behavior).

40|$|Executive Summary During 2010 - 2012, a Leonardo da Vinci-funded EU project {{focused on}} {{enhancing}} the language skills of Deaf people, interpreters and Health Care Professionals. Project partners from Cyprus, Ireland, Poland, Scotland and Sweden reviewed current knowledge {{of policy and}} practice, and embedded the resulting analysis into a programme of materials to support reflection, knowledge and skills development internationally. This report presents the project's initial 'state-of-the-art' review, with particular reference to the partner countries. Sign languages are now widely recognised, for theoretical and practical purposes, as full, natural languages, and sign language interpreting has consequently been established as a respected profession. Sign language interpreters mediate between hearing and deaf people: this entails a complex transfer of meaning between languages, cultural domains and linguistic modalities, and between members of highly literate communities and those whose languages have no written form. Decades of development in understanding {{of the most effective}} part to be played by interpreters in small-group dialogue have concluded that communication is best facilitated with recognition of the interpreter as a linguistic partner, and an active participant in the joint creation of meaning. Good practice in interpreting rarely entails a passive role whereby the interpreter acts as a <b>mere</b> <b>conduit</b> for others' words.   In respect of healthcare interpreting, the situation in the partner countries (and beyond) varies widely, from minimal recognition of the need for dedicated provision for deaf patients, to relatively explicit and well-resourced entitlement to services. In none of the partner countries do services address all identified requirements, despite recognition that inadequate provision can lead to damaging and indeed life-threatening consequences. Training and associated resources for all three key groups – interpreters, healthcare staff and deaf people – are insufficient or non-existent across the board. No-one has a stable, clear set of expectations about how communication can most effectively proceed in these situations. In this context, it is predictable that regulation of quality can be highly problematic. Comparison with North America and Australia highlights a range of adoptable best practices, requiring investment over time in order to generate and implement more effective approaches. It must be recognised that the mere provision of sign language interpreters is only the beginning of true access to healthcare for deaf people. In order to maximise positive outcomes, members of all three key groups must become familiar with a common set of assumptions and practices to reinforce the need to operate as a collaborating triad in the co-constructing of effective interaction. Consistent, high-quality outcomes need to be assured through empowered regulatory mechanisms, for which models exist internationally.  MEDISIGN...|$|E
