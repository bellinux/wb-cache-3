The bridge is modeled as a continuous supported Bernoulli-Euler beam and the boundary value problem of the beam is solved to get the exact mode shape functions of vibrating beam with inner supports.

Results obtained from simulation study show that the method is effective in identifying <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> and acceptable results can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{identify}} <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> on a continuous bridge {{has been developed}} in this paper. The bridge is modelled as a Bernoulli-Euler beam and the boundary value problem of the beam is solved to get the exact mode shape functions of the vibrating beam with intermediate supports. As the number of spans of the bridge increases, the identification accuracy decreases {{and at the same}} time more execution time is needed to finish one case study. To minimize this problem, a method has been developed to identify <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> on a selected span of interest from the continuous bridge. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the coefficient matrix of the overdetermined equation is used in the solution. To evaluate the method, simulations of two <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> on a continuous bridge and on one selected span from the continuous bridge are studied. White noise is added to the simulated bending moment and acceleration responses to study the effect of noise in <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> identification problem for different numbers and arrangements of sensors.

40|$|According {{to its own}} purposes, {{including}} survival, {{the cell}} reacts to the conditions of its medium. Such a vital phenomenon implies relational energetics. It includes unconscious psychic energy whose regulating model is the Life and Sense archetype. Its relational power could result from a natural algebraic property of extension. This extension can extend any organic magnitude to 4 D event. Thus it allows some perception of the extracellular structure variations. This perception applies to <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> of the cell signaling activators, through psychic energy. This psychical energy includes a potential, the cell attitude or status, and psychic <b>moving</b> <b>forces,</b> or tendencies.

Opposed by the Labour leadership, the Unity Campaign failed in its intentions. Rather than face expulsion from Labour, Cripps dissolved the Socialist League in 1937. Tribune, set up as the campaign's newspaper by Cripps and George Strauss, survived. In early 1939, however, Cripps was expelled from the Labour Party for his advocacy of a Popular Front with the Communist Party, the Independent Labour Party, the Liberal Party and anti-appeasement Conservatives.|$|E

Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician.

500|$|Expressed {{justifications}} {{for refusing to}} obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from {{a deep sense of}} responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of [...] "moral innocency" [...] and inexpertness in moral training: [...] "the <b>moving</b> <b>force</b> of events is always too much for conscience". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for example, [...] "then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced." [...] As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that [...] "radical pacifism" [...] could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{load data}} have been Valuable for bridge and {{pavement}} design. Traditional ways to acquire truck axle and gross weight information are expensive {{and subject to}} bias, and {{this has led to}} the development of Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) techniques. Most of the existing WIM systems have been developed to measure only the static axle loads. This paper aims to introduce a method to identify moving dynamic loads on bridges using the bridge responses caused by such loads. A closed-form solution can be obtained to identify moving constant loads, while numerical methods must be used to identify the time-varying moving loads. The set of equations that leads to the solution is based on Euler's equation of beams. A two-axle vehicle model is developed to generate the theoretical responses and the corresponding interactive <b>moving</b> <b>forces.</b> Studies were carried out to check whether the proposed method could recover the original interactive <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> and the method was found to be feasible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the statistical prediction of dynamic response of a bridge structure with inherent uncertainty under stochastic moving loads. The uncertainty in bridge structure, which is assumed with Gaussian properties, is modeled by the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method. The uncertain <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> with Gaussian distribution {{are represented by}} the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. The Polynomial chaos expansion is adopted to represent the uncertain response such that the proposed algorithm {{is not limited to}} system with small uncertainty. The bridge is modeled as a simply supported Bernoulli-Euler beam and the bridge-vehicle interaction forces are modeled as Gaussian random processes related to the power spectral density of the surface roughness defined in the ISO standard. The mathematical model of the bridge-vehicle system is formulated and solved with the Newmark-beta method. The response statistics of the bridge are compared with those from Monte Carlo simulation. Different levels of uncertainty in both the system parameters and the <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> are studied to investigate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in the stochastic analysis of the bridge-vehicle interaction problem.

2500|$|It was {{probably}} the first introductory book that examined Indian philosophy through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on anthropological, economic and philological studies. The book traced the philosophical development in India from the Vedic period to later Buddhism. In this introductory study, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya targets another important myth that overshadows the study of Indian philosophy – that of the presupposed predominance of shastrartha or textual interpretation. He views the development of Indian philosophy as the consequence of real clashes of ideas – [...] "contradiction constituted the <b>moving</b> <b>force</b> behind the Indian philosophical development".

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{flexural}} vibrations of a rectangular plate having arbitrary supports at both ends is investigated. The solution technique which is suitable for all variants of classical boundary conditions involves using the generalized two-dimensional integral transform to reduce the fourth order partial differential equation governing the vibration of the plate to a second order ordinary differential equation which is then treated with the modified asymptotic method of Struble. The closed form solutions are obtained and numerical analyses in plotted curves are presented. It is also deduced that for the same natural frequency, the critical speed for the system traversed by uniformly distributed <b>moving</b> <b>forces</b> at constant speed is {{greater than that of}} the uniformly distributed moving mass problem for both clamped-clamped and simple-clamped end conditions.
