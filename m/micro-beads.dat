The few people who returned to Lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city, but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions, living in poorly built houses and reed huts.

While the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone, the people retained several Harappan ways in writing, pottery and utensils. About this time ASI archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from Punjab and Sindh into Saurashtra and to the valley of Sarasvati (1900-1700 BCE). Hundreds of ill-equipped settlements have been attributed to this people as Late Harappans a completely de-urbanised culture characterised by rising illiteracy, less complex economy, unsophisticated administration and poverty. Though Indus seals went out of use, the system of weights with an 8.573 gram (0.3024 oz avoirdupois) unit was retained. Between 1700 and 1600 BCE, trade would revive again. In Lothal, Harappan ceramic works of bowls, dishes and jars were mass-produced. Merchants used local materials such as chalcedony instead of chert for stone blades.

In this paper, results are discussed from a two-dimensional computational investigation of the atmospheric pressure plasma functionalization of non-planar and porous surfaces of polypropylene with NHx and O-containing groups. For the former, the discharge is sustained in He/NH 3 /H 2 O mixtures in a dielectric barrier–corona configuration. Significant microscopic non-uniformities arise due to competing pathways for reactive gas phase radicals such as OH and NH 2, and on the surface by the availability of OH to initiate amine attachment. The treatment of inside surfaces of porous polymer <b>micro-beads</b> placed on an electrode is particularly sensitive to view angles to the discharge and pore size, and is ultimately controlled by the relative rates of radical transport and surface reactions deep into the pores.

The modelled chains develop an anti-symmetric S-shape that is stable, if the Mason number for a given chain length does not surpass a critical value.

Moreover, we performed experiments with superparamagnetic <b>micro-beads</b> in a small fluid volume exposed to a uniform rotating magnetic field.

The effects of micro-bead diameters in the range 0. 3 - 2. 0 mm on yeast cell growth were investigated.

The change in micro-bead density was then converted to strain in the gel, from which we estimated the spatial distribution of compressive stress around the spheroids.

As a substrate, the porous alumina, which is prepared by a gel-casting process using the binary slip of alumina powder and PMMA spherical <b>micro-bead,</b> is dried {{at room temperature}} for 24 h and then sintered at 1600 for 2 h. Porcelain is coated on the porous alumina substrate and then re-sintered at 987. Bi- and tri-layered structures are produced by the different dwell times (2 min, 10 min) at re-sintering temperature.

The indentation cracks do not propagate into the porous alumina through interface (porosity; 36 ~ 62 %) except for another one (porosity; 70 %) in the bi-layered samples. In the case of the high porosity bi-layered sample (porosity; 70 %), cracks are scattered along the 3 -D open-pore channels.

40|$|The brain blood {{vasculature}} {{consists of}} a highly ramified vessel network that is tailored to meet its physiological functions. How the brain vasculature is formed has long been fascinating biologists. Here we report that the developing vasculature in the zebrafish midbrain undergoes not only angiogenesis but also extensive vessel pruning, which is driven by changes in blood flow. This pruning process shapes the initial exuberant interconnected meshwork into a simplified architecture. Using in vivo long-term serial confocal imaging of the same zebrafish larvae during 1. 5 – 7. 5 d post-fertilization, {{we found that the}} early formed midbrain vasculature consisted of many vessel loops and higher order segments. Vessel pruning occurred preferentially at loop-forming segments via a process mainly involving lateral migration of endothelial cells (ECs) from pruned to unpruned segments rather than EC apoptosis, leading to gradual reduction in the vasculature complexity with development. Compared to unpruned ones, pruned segments exhibited a low and variable blood flow, which further decreased irreversibly prior to the onset of pruning. Local blockade of blood flow with <b>micro-bead</b> obstruction led to vessel pruning, whereas increasing blood flow by noradrenergic elevation of heartbeat impeded the pruning process.

This study describes a novel method to isolate primary ECs from healthy organs, repair blastemas and tumors as examples of non-proliferating and proliferating benign and malignant tissues and their functional characterization. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single cell suspensions from hearts, lungs, repair blastemas and tumors were incubated consecutively with an anti-CD 31 antibody and magnetic <b>micro-beads,</b> coupled to a derivative of biotin and streptavidin, respectively. Following magnetic bead separation, CD 31 -positive ECs were released by biotin-streptavidin competition. In the absence of <b>micro-beads,</b> ECs became adherent to plastic surfaces. ECs from proliferating repair blastemas and tumors were larger and exhibited higher expression densities of CD 31, CD 105 and CD 102 compared to those from non-proliferating normal tissues such as heart and lung. The expression density of CD 34 was particularly high in tumor-derived ECs, and that of CD 54 and CD 144 in ECs of repair blastemas. Functionally, ECs of non-proliferating and proliferating tissues differed in their capacity to form tubes in matrigel and to align under flow conditions. Conclusions/Significance: This method provides a powerful tool to generate high yields of viable, primary ECs of different origins.

The movement towards and immobilisation of streptavidin coated beads onto a biotin functionalised waveguide surface is achieved by using a quarter-wavelength mode pushing beads onto the surface, while the removal of non-specifically bound beads uses a second quarter-wavelength mode which exhibits a kinetic energy maximum at the boundary between the carrier layer and fluid, drawing beads towards this surface. This has been achieved using a multi-modal acoustic device which exhibits both of these quarter-wavelength resonances. Both 1 -D acoustic modelling and finite element analysis has been used to design this device and to investigate the spatial uniformity of the field. We demonstrate experimentally that 90 % of specifically bound beads remain attached after applying ultrasound, with 80 % of non-specifically bound control beads being successfully removed acoustically. This approach overcomes problems associated with lengthy sedimentation processes used for bead-based bioassays and surface (electrostatic) forces, which delay or prevent immobilisation.

RSA has been used extensively for monitoring prosthesis fixation in hip and knee replacements. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying RSA towards the monitoring of fracture healing. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of using RSA to measure strain, stress, and plate migration in a distal femur fracture model. Methods: Femoral sawbones with a distal femur fracture were used as models. A distal femur condylar locking compression plate (LCP) was used to reduce the fracture model. Stainless steel screws were used to fasten the plate to the sawbone. In addition, translucent polyester screws were composed, embedded with 1 mm steel beads, and fastened to the most proximal and distal portions of the plate. This allowed for recognition by the RSA imaging modality. The femoral sawbones were then placed in a mechanical testing complex and RSA X-rays taken at different forces of compression. The radiographs were analyzed for plate migration using the 1 mm steel beads as points of reference. Results: Preliminary data indicate that it is possible to use a plate model that incorporates a <b>micro-bead</b> system to measure migration. Further analysis will quantify the amount of migration to determine whether significant changes occur at different stages of compression. Conclusion: The ability to measure plate migration in a Radiostereometric Analysis X-ray model is an important step towards improving the ability of orthopedic surgeons to monitor fracture healing and prevent non-union.

Acclimation alone, or {{in conjunction}} with starvation had no significant effect on supercooling. Surface moisture on the aphid cuticle during cooling resulted in a significant loss in supercooling. Repeat coolings to temperatures markedly above the mean supercooling point resulted in increasing levels of mortality. Field collected avenae showed a seasonal variation in supercooling with a higher mean supercooling point in the winter than {{in the remainder of}} the year. Field populations showed a dramatic decline in December when environmental temperatures were well above mean and individual supercooling points. It was concluded that the aphids were dying before they froze and that the supercooling point was not a reliable indicator of the lower lethal temperature. The development and reproduction of s. avenae in the field over winter were directly and positively related to temperature whilst mortality increased with decreasing temperature. The development of a multi-channel <b>micro-bead</b> thermistor unit allowed the study of a previously unrecorded thermal event (exotherm) during the cooling of aphids. The cause of the exotherm is unknown and warrants further investigation. Laboratory experiments on avenae and the lupin aphid, Macrosiphum albifrons revealed that the adults of the two species had lower lethal temperatures (LT 50) of approximately - 7. 5 °C and - 7. 0 °C respectively.

The three building blocks of the proposed baseline were fifty-micron poly(methyl methacrylate) thin films as substrates, channel patterning by laser ablation, and device assembly by thermal-fusion bonding. Channel fabrication was characterized and tuned to produce the desired dimensions and surface roughness. Thermal bonding was performed using an adapted mechanical testing device and optimized to produce the maximum bonding strength without significant channel deformation. Bonding multilayered devices, incorporating conduction lines, and integrating various types of membranes as passive elements demonstrated the versatility of the process. Finally, this baseline was used to fabricate a droplet generator and a DNA detection chip based on <b>micro-bead</b> agglomeration. It was found that a combination of low laser power and scanning speed produced channel surfaces with better uniformity than those obtained with higher values. In addition, the implemented bonding technique provided the process with the most reliable bond strength reported, so far, for thin-film microfluidics. Overall, the present work proved to be versatile, reliable, and fast, making it a good candidate to reproduce several on-chip functions. Future work includes implementing thick-substrate bonding techniques to further improve the process and decrease energy requirements...|$|R
