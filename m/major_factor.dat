There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>major</b> <b>factors</b> influencing adoption of smartphone to promote its use by older adults. Background: Despite increasing proportion of elderly people and elderly market, the proportion of elderly smartphone user is still relatively small compared to whole smartphone users. Thus, we need to find out <b>major</b> <b>factors</b> influencing adoption of smartphone to increase proportion of elderly smartphone users. Method: Seven <b>major</b> <b>factors</b> were extracted from 36 survey questions using factor analysis. Regression analysis was also applied to determine specific factors affecting intention of use based on user versus non-user of smartphone, age, gender, and educational background. Results: As results of factor analysis and regression analysis, <b>major</b> <b>factors</b> influencing adoption of smartphone for elderly users were significantly different according to gender, age, educational background based on smartphone users or non-users. Conclusion: The result of this study identified <b>major</b> <b>factors</b> influencing adoption of smartphone for the elderly and provided basic information related to adoption of smartphone according to elderly people's characteristics. Consequently, we can expect to reduce the information gap and to improve quality of life for the elderly. Application: The development and marketing strategy could be applied differently based on the factors influencing adoption of smartphone. It is also possibl...|$|R
