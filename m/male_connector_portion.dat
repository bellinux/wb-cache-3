50|$|While {{the female}} {{connector}} is slotted such that a cable {{with a matching}} keyed <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> can not be inserted upside-down, some manufacturers (including Sun Microsystems) supplied internal cables with <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> {{that did not have}} the key, allowing for incorrect (and possibly damaging) connections.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} cables used in DMX512 networks employ XLR5 <b>connectors,</b> with a <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> {{on one end}} and {{a female}} connector on the other end. The cable's <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> attaches to the transmitting, female jack (OUT), and its female connector attaches to the receiving, male jack (IN).|$|R

50|$|Pigtails {{can have}} female or <b>male</b> <b>{{connectors}}.</b> Female connectors could be mounted {{in a patch}} panel, often in pairs although single-fiber solutions exist, {{to allow them to}} be connected to endpoints or other fiber runs with patch fibers. Alternatively they can have <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> and plug directly into an optical transceiver.|$|R

50|$|The {{connector}} is circular, {{with the}} <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> having two pins placed symmetrically inside a circular shield, {{and the female}} connector having two receptacles surrounded by a circular groove to accept the male shield, in turn surrounded by a second circular shield which projects 6 mm past the mating surface and encloses the <b>male</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|An edge <b>connector</b> is the <b>portion</b> of {{a printed}} circuit board (PCB) {{consisting}} of traces leading {{to the edge of the}} board that are intended to plug into a matching socket. The edge connector is a money-saving device because it only requires a single discrete female <b>connector</b> (the <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> is formed out of the edge of the PCB), and they also tend to be fairly robust and durable. They are commonly used in computers for expansion slots for peripheral cards, such as PCI, PCI Express, and AGP cards.|$|R

50|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} can {{be improved}} by coating all bare copper wires with silicone grease. The <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> body is typically crimped, or sometimes screwed, onto the exposed outer braid. Female F Type connectors have an external 3/8-32 UNEF thread (3/8 in diameter). Most <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> have a matching internally threaded connecting ring, though push-on versions are also available.|$|R

50|$|Most typically, {{external}} drive enclosures will have female connectors, while cables {{will have two}} <b>male</b> <b>connectors.</b> As with everything SCSI, there are exceptions.|$|R
50|$|There is {{typically}} a single spring-loaded contact {{at the side}} of the <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> and a pin in the center corresponding to the intended female plug.|$|R
50|$|Attachment is {{made with}} a 5/8-27 {{threaded}} ring that can be unthreaded over {{the body of the}} connector body allowing the female connector to become a <b>male</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Where XLR {{connectors}} {{are used}} for DC power, the genders are reversed {{with respect to their}} standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors [...] "follow the pin," [...] such that a <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> is an output and a female connector is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR connectors) the female connector is the output and the <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> is the input. This makes accidental contact with live parts less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.|$|R
50|$|RS-232 devices may be {{classified}} as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> have DTE pin functions, and female connectors have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.|$|R

50|$|The widest {{application}} of D-subs is for RS-232 serial communications, though the standard {{did not make}} this connector mandatory. RS-232 devices originally used the DB25, but for many applications the less common signals were omitted, allowing a DE-9 to be used. The standard specifies a <b>male</b> <b>connector</b> for terminal equipment and a female connector for modems, but many variations exist. IBM PC-compatible computers tend to have <b>male</b> <b>connectors</b> at the device and female connectors at the modems. Early Apple Macintosh models used DE-9 connectors for RS-422 multi-drop serial interfaces (which can operate as RS-232). Later Macintosh models use 8-pin miniature DIN connectors instead.|$|R
5000|$|Garden hoses connect using a male/female thread connection. Spigots {{typically}} have <b>male</b> <b>connectors,</b> and {{one end of}} a hose has a captive nut which fits the threads. The technical term for this arrangement is a [...] "hose union".|$|R
