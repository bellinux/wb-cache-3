500|$|Although no Hugo Awards were {{presented}} in 1954, the 2004 World Science Fiction Convention awarded [...] "Retro Hugos" [...] for that year. Two Beyond stories appeared as runners-up: Sturgeon's [...] "…And <b>My</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>Is</b> Great…" [...] placed third in the novella category, and Cogswell's [...] "The Wall Around the World" [...] fifth in the novelette category. In addition, Gold placed fifth in the editor category, though this recognized his work at Galaxy {{as well as at}} Beyond.|$|E
500|$|Two {{series of}} {{companion}} novels were {{issued by the}} publishers. [...] The first series, Galaxy Science Fiction Novels, began in 1950 with Eric Frank Russell's Sinister Barrier; seven titles were released by World Editions, and a further twenty-eight by Guinn's Galaxy Publishing Corporation. [...] The books were initially in digest format but this was changed to a standard paperback format {{for the last four}} titles. In 1959 the line was sold to Beacon Books, which produced another 11 volumes. Beacon specialized in softcore pornography, and changed the titles of most of the books they published to be more suggestive. [...] The last title, Sin in Space (originally Outpost Mars), by Cyril Judd (a pseudonym for Cyril Kornbluth and Judith Merril) appeared in 1961. Two years later a second series, Galaxy Magabooks, appeared; each of these consisted of two short novels, both by the same author, published in a single volume. Only three were released; the last, And <b>My</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>Is</b> Great/Baby Is Three by Theodore Sturgeon, appeared in 1964.|$|E
2500|$|The route {{includes}} unstable {{areas such}} as Trebanos, liable to landslide and earthquake due to extensive historic mineworkings, which are deemed too dangerous for mains gas to be piped to local homes. Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: [...] "If there was a shift or a landslip again, <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak." [...] National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during {{the building of the}} pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result.|$|E

60|$|I was {{so tired}} that even <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> not able to keep me awake long.|$|R
60|$|See, {{where he}} comes, all pensive and alone; A gloomy fury has o'erspread his face: 'Tis so! and all <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> come to pass.|$|R
2500|$|On December 9, Brian Chase {{admitted}} he had posted the false biography to Wikipedia {{because he believed}} Wikipedia to be [...] "some sort of joke Web site." [...] After confessing, Chase was fired from his job at Rush Delivery. Seigenthaler received a hand-written apology and spoke with Chase on the phone. Seigenthaler confirmedas he had previously statedthat he would not file a lawsuit {{in relation to the}} incident, and urged Rush Delivery to rehire Chase, which it did. Seigenthaler commented: [...] "I'm glad this aspect of it is over." [...] He stated that he was concerned that [...] "every biography on Wikipedia is going to be hit by this stuffthink what they'd do to Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton, to mention two. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that we're going to get government regulation of the Internet as a result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if {{she only}} would! <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> she'll be like other amateur performers--'subject to a cold' or something. These gifted {{people are so}} often disappointing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{difficulty}} about that. He is {{even now}} in the colony. I saw him in a gambling-house half-an-hour since. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that, now the murder's out, he'll bolt before we can secure him." ...|$|E
60|$|She stirred herself, {{put back}} the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: {{she looked so}} little changed that <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> {{instantly}} dissipated.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is peril, then!" [...] exclaimed Cecilia; [...] "your looks {{announce}} it. Captain Borroughcliffe! The changing countenance of {{my cousin}} {{tells me that}} <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> too true!" ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--A dreadful thought {{has just}} {{occurred}} to me--that {{this is a}} quadruple letter, and that Elstree may not be within the twopenny post. Pray Heaven <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> unfounded.|$|R
6000|$|Ber. So great a fear {{of death}} I have not shown, [...] That I would shed his blood to save my own; [...] <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> but from human frailty brought, [...] And never mingled with a wicked thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you {{proposed}} {{to me to}} join you in forcing Oscar to speak out," [...] he said, [...] "I was not quite easy in my mind about the consequences. After what I have just heard, <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> removed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not punctilio,' {{said his}} grandmother, looking distressed. 'It is needful {{to be on}} the safe side with such a man as Mr. Ponsonby. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that he may send her home with orders not to come near us.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was alarmed}} by Mrs. Decker's request. Suppose the trio should come out? I would surely <b>be</b> discovered. But <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> groundless, {{as the next}} words of Mr. Woodward proved.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mistake me," [...] she replied, {{and looked}} up at him suddenly. [...] "Do you suppose <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> for myself?" [...] She paused again, and then {{abruptly}} asked him, [...] "What will befall you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bunyan got quit of his terror at last, briefly by {{believing in}} the {{goodness}} of God. He did not say, like Mr. Carlyle, [...] "Well, if all <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> true, what then?" [...] His was a Christian, not a stoical deliverance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have taken}} the east from me, you {{have taken the}} west from me, you have taken what is before me and what is behind me; you have taken the moon, you have taken the sun from me, and <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> great you have taken God from me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> lest {{this sort}} of thing shall lead to a demand {{on the part of the}} public for {{condensed}} novels. What busy man is going to spend a week of evenings reading a book when a nice kind sub-editor is prepared in five minutes to tell him what it is all about! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{people have}} set their hearts on the thing, and Ujarak {{will try to}} escape. He will perhaps say that his torngak has {{told him to go}} hunting to-morrow. But our customs require him to keep his word. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that he will sneak off in the night. He is a sly fox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An unanswerable argument," [...] said Wilding, smiling. [...] "But the Lord, I am told by {{the gentlemen}} of your cloth, works in His own good time, and <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> all lest, finding us {{unprepared}} of ourselves, the Lord's good time be not yet." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} when I went back, <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> realised: the door was refused to me--my Lady was not at home. This I knew to be false: I had watched the door the whole morning from a lodging I took at a house opposite.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I would, I say, {{but for a}} peril to you. I see <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> unfounded. You were safe; but in {{my desire}} to guard you from what has come on poor Amy, my feelings, though not wont to {{overpower}} me, carried me further than I intended.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{you will}} require it. You {{do not know}} yet how much you have gone through. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is,</b> that you will feel {{it all the more}} painfully when the {{excitement}} is past. I shall send you up a cordial; and you must promise me to take it. You owe me a little debt you know, to-day; you must pay it by taking my medicines." ...|$|E
60|$|In my days {{only did}} I attain any measure of happiness. My nights marked {{the reign of}} fear--and such fear! I make bold to state that no man of all the men who walk the earth with me ever suffer fear of like kind and degree. For <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> the fear of long ago, the fear that was rampant in the Younger World, and in the youth of the Younger World. In short, the fear that reigned supreme in that period known as the Mid-Pleistocene.|$|E
6000|$|... "I conjure you, Madam, I repeat it, Be not {{precipitate}} in anything; lest, as <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is,</b> you replunge Europe {{into the}} troubles {{it has only}} just escaped from! As to me, I have found, since the Peace, {{so much to do}} within my own borders, that I have not, I assure you, had time, Madam, to think of going abroad. I confine myself to forming a thousand wishes for the prosperity of your Electoral Highness, assuring you of the high esteem with which I am,--F." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xxiv. 48.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} brute would rush on us. But it did not. For all that dreadful night we saw or heard it no more. Indeed, I began {{to hope that}} after all the bullet had reached some mortal part and that the great ape was dead.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the silence}} was broken by the well-remembered tones of Mehevi, and at the kindly accents of his voice, <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> {{immediately}} dissipated. “Tommo, Toby, ki ki!” (eat). He had waited to address us, until he had assured himself that we were both awake, at which he seemed somewhat surprised.|$|R
60|$|Joc. Then <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> true. Methought I {{heard your}} voice,--and yet I doubted,-- Now roaring like the ocean, when the winds Fight with the waves; now, in a still small tone Your dying accents fell, as {{wrecking}} ships, After the dreadful yell, sink murmuring down, And bubble up a noise.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not doubt}} the play's being well received, but <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> {{that these people}} would be looked upon as mere abstractions, and would have but a cold welcome in consequence, and would not lay hold of your {{audience}}. Now, when you have laid hold of your audience and have accustomed them to your theatre, you may produce [...] "The White Rose," [...] with far greater justice to the author, and to the manager also. Wait. Feel your way. Perkin Warbeck is too far removed from analogy with the sympathies and {{lives of the people}} for a beginning.|$|E
6000|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> over, I {{can laugh}} at my last night's adventure. I find that at fifty all men grow incorrigible, and lovers especially; for, certainly, never any {{creature}} {{could be worse}} treated than your father; [How's this, Valerio? I am amazed.] and yet the good, old, out-of-fashion gentleman heard himself rallied and bore it with all the patience of a Christian prince. [Now, 'tis plain, the lady in masquerade is a mistress of my son's, and the undutiful wretch was in the plot to abuse me.] Ascanio {{will tell you the}} latter part of our misfortune, how hardly we got into the cloister. [A nun, too! Oh, the devil!] When we meet next, pray provide to laugh heartily; for there is subject sufficient for a plentiful fit, and fop enough to spare for another time. [...] LUCRETIA.|$|E
6000|$|... "With the sad {{experience}} of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task {{is now in}} reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see {{the characteristics of the}} vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight. But it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without prejudge. Her teeth are sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotize her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fel. That mercy, tyrant, thou deny'st to me, [...] At thy {{last breath}} may heaven refuse to thee! [...] <b>My</b> <b>fears</b> <b>are</b> going, and I death can view: [...] I see, I see him there thy steps pursue, [...] And, with a lifted arm, and silent pace, [...] Stalk after thee, just aiming in his chace.|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} I had my doubts myself when I {{reflected}} upon the great traffic which had passed along the London {{road in the}} interval. <b>My</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> groundless, however, as {{the other}} Martians, at first struck dumb with wonderment, finally broke into wild peals of {{laughter}} and applause. I did not recognize the applause as such, but later, when I had become acquainted with their customs, I learned that I had won what they seldom accord, a manifestation of approbation.|$|R
