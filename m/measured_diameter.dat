5000|$|The best {{method for}} {{modeling}} {{that is to}} divide the trunk into adjacent segments no more than 3 to 5 feet in height/length and then apply either the cone, paraboloid, or neiloid frustum form to each. [...] This is a labor-intensive process. To gain efficiency, longer sections can be chosen that appear to the eye to have uniform curvature. However, the longer the segment, the more {{important it is to}} choose the optimum solid. Over longer frustums, the greater volume contribution of the paraboloid or the lesser volume of the neiloid becomes apparent when compared to the basic conical form. Therefore, when modeling longer frustums the measurer needs to perform independent checks to insure that the right solid has been chosen. One way to check is to take a diameter measurement at an intermediate point and then project what the diameter would be for the chosen model at the point. If the projected diameter is substantially greater or lesser than the <b>measured</b> <b>diameter,</b> then the selected solid is not the right choice. In this case, an intermediate form that combines the two forms through weighting may be appropriate. The measurer selects weights and applies them to each solid formula to arrive at an intermediate result. Each frustum can represent a different parent cone, paraboloid, or neiloid so {{that there is not a}} need to impose a single form on the entire tree.|$|E
5000|$|To assure accuracy, the {{calibration}} of {{the optical}} factor should be checked for each instrument rather than solely relying upon the manufacturer’s specifications. A series of tree diameters up {{the trunk of}} the tree are systematically measured using this procedure {{from the base of the}} tree to the top and their height is noted. Diameters can sometimes be measured with the monocular w/reticle in sections where it is difficult to obtain accurate laser distances because intervening thin brush or branches. Distances to the obscured section may be interpolated from measurements made above and below the obscured section. Some photographic methods are being developed to allow calculation of diameters of trunk and limb segments in photographs that contain a scale of known size and where distance to the target is known. Essentially, the camera is treated as if it were a monocular w/reticle and the [...] "optical factor" [...] for the camera at a particular focal length is calculated for each photograph based upon the size of a reference scale and its distance from the camera. The scale need not be present in every image of an individual tree so long as the focal length has not been changed between images. Using this principle a shot can be made of each measurement point through an enlarged image to make the girth measurements easier and more accurate. In addition, this allows the central, less optically distorted portion of the image to be used for the measurements. The <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> of the almost cylindrical section is not going to vary significantly with viewing angle. Using data from clinometer and distance measurements at each end of a segment, the height, length, and distance of intermediate points can be calculated and the trunk diameters at these points can be measured. One advantages of the photographic method is the ubiquity of the digital camera. In addition, once the framework data is measured in the field, the trunk diameter measurement process can be done later on a computer. The photographic image can be also easily be re-measured if an error is encountered in the calculations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{effects of}} {{hypertension}} and diabetes {{on the physical}} properties of large arteries were compared in men. Background. Although these two diseases are linked to vascular stiffening, no study has analyzed whether the arterial rigidity in diabetes is as substantial as in hypertension. Methods. Noninvasive measurements of brachial artery mean pressure, diameter (pulsed Doppler study) and compliance (pulse wave velocity) were obtained in 29 men: 11 control subjects, 9 hypertensive nondiabetic patients and 9 diabetic normotensive patients. Individual diameter- and compliance-pressure curves extrapolated from the <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> and mean pressure point with a logarithmic elastic model permitted calculation of isobaric diameter and compliance {{at the same pressure}} in each subject. Results. Compared with control subjects, hypertensive patients had a larger brachial artery <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> and isobaric diameter (p < 0. 01) and lower measured and isobaric compliance (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 01). Compared with control subjects, diabetic patients had lower measured and isobaric compliance (p < 0. 01). Comparison of diabetic and hypertensive patients showed that <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> and isobaric diameter were decreased in the former (p < 0. 01). In the control and hypertensive groups, mean pressure correlated positively with <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> and isobaric diameter (p < 0. 01) and negatively with measured and isobaric compliance (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 01, respectively). In the control and diabetic groups, fasting glucose correlated negatively with measured and isobaric compliance (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 05). Conclusions, Intrinsic alterations of the large artery independent of a stretching pressure effect reduce arterial elasticity similarly in those with hypertension or diabetes. The loss of compliance is related to the chronic elevation of blood pressure in hypertension and to that of glycemia in diabetes and is associated with a relative large artery vasoconstriction in diabetic patients as compared with patients with hypertension...|$|E

Area of study: Central-Bohemian highlands, Czech Republic; a region that represents average stand conditions of production forests of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) in central Europe Material and methods: The accuracy of stem curves modeled using natural cubic splines from a set of <b>measured</b> <b>diameters</b> was evaluated for 85 closely measured stems of Norway spruce using five statistical indicators and compared {{to the accuracy of}} three additional models based on different spline types selected for their ability to represent stem curves. The optimal positions to <b>measure</b> <b>diameters</b> were identified using an aggregate objective function approach. Main results: The optimal positions of the input points vary depending on the properties of each spline type. If the optimal input points for each spline are used, then all spline types are able to give reasonable results with higher numbers of input points. The commonly used natural cubic spline was outperformed by other spline types. The lowest errors occur by interpolating the points using the Catmull-Rom spline, which gives accurate and unbiased volume estimates, even with only five input points. Research highlights: The study contributes to more accurate representation of stem form and therefore more accurate estimation of stem volume using data obtained from terrestrial imagery or other close-range remote sensing methods...|$|R

40|$|Wave {{intensity}} (WI) is a hemodynamics index, {{which is}} the product of changes in pressure and velocity across the wave-front. Wave Intensity Analysis, which is a time domain technique allows for the separation of running waves into their forward and backward directions and traditionally uses the measured pressure and velocity waveforms. However, due to the possible difficulty in obtaining reliable pressure waveforms non-invasively, investigating the use of wall displacement instead of pressure signals in calculating WI may have clinical merits. In this paper, we developed an algorithm in which we use the <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> of flexible tube's wall and flow velocity to separate the velocity waveform into its forward and backward directions. The new algorithm is also used to separate wave intensity into its forward and backward directions. In vitro experiments were carried out in two sized flexible tubes, 12 mm and 16 mm in diameters, each is of 2 m in length. Pressure, velocity and diameter were taken at three measuring sites. A semi-sinusoidal wave was generated using a piston pump, which ejected 40 cc water into each tube. The results show that separated wave intensity into the forward and backward directions of the new algorithm using the <b>measured</b> <b>diameter</b> and velocity are almost identical in shape to those traditionally using the measured pressure and velocity. We conclude that the new algorithm presented in this work, could have clinical advantages since the required information can be obtained non-invasively...|$|E
