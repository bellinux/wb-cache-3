5000|$|Unlike {{other members}} of the infraorder, the front of the lower jaw is not flattened, but curved and {{tapering}} anteriorly. Cox [...] suggests this feature, as well as the strong jaw musculature, indicated by the large lateral wing on the dentary, <b>may</b> point towards <b>grubbing</b> in the dirt for food. However, subsequent analyses of other specimens have not featured the same degree of bluntness of the anterior end of the lower jaw, and call this theory into question. Nevertheless, the significant reduction of the tough, horny covering of the palate in Dicynodontoides suggests that whatever it <b>may</b> have <b>grubbed</b> up and consumed would have been both small, soft, and required minimal preparation. Roots or small invertebrates could provide the answer to this problem. [...] Nevertheless, the exact nature of the feeding ecology of Dicynodontoides continues to elude researchers.|$|R

If the compost pile was stored outside, it <b>may</b> contain <b>grubs</b> or other insects attracted to decaying matter.

He did tell me he meant to stay about there, and it may be he has done so. He said if he moved away and got a chance he would send me word; but as there ain't nairy a post-office within about five hundred miles of where he is, his only chance of sending a letter would be by a hunter who chanced to be going down to the settlements, and who, like enough, would put it into his hunting-shirt and never give it another thought. So whether he has stayed there or not is more nor I can say." ...|$|R

But, when these savages made the assault on us, killing Corporal M'Nab and his men {{as if they had}} been so many rabbits, Lieutenant Muir and myself took refuge in one of the holes of this here island, of which there are so many among the rocks, and there we remained stowed away like two leaguers in a ship's hold, until we gave out for want of <b>grub.</b> A man <b>may</b> say that <b>grub</b> is the foundation of human nature. I desired the Quartermaster to make terms, for we could have defended ourselves for an hour or two in the place, bad as it was; but he declined, on the ground that the knaves wouldn't keep faith if any of them were hurt, and so there was no use in asking them to. I consented to strike, on two principles; one, that we might be said to have struck already, for running below is generally thought to be giving up the ship; and the other, that we had an enemy in our stomachs that was more formidable in his attacks than the enemy on deck. Hunger is a d----ble circumstance, as any man who has lived on it eight-and-forty hours will acknowledge." ...|$|R

'Unfortunately, {{these stories}} were {{somewhat}} {{disturbed by the}} unlooked-for reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself, some ten years afterwards, a ragged, contented, rheumatic old man. He told his story to the clergyman, and also to the mayor; and in course of time it began to be received {{as a matter of}} history, in which form it has continued down to this very day. The believers in the weathercock tale, having misplaced their confidence once, were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again, so they looked as wise as they could, shrugged their shoulders, touched their foreheads, and murmured something about Gabriel Grub having drunk all the Hollands, and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone; and they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblin's cavern, by saying that he had seen the world, and grown wiser. But this opinion, which was by no means a popular one at any time, gradually died off; and be the matter how it <b>may,</b> as Gabriel <b>Grub</b> was afflicted with rheumatism {{to the end of his}} days, this story has at least one moral, if it teach no better one--and that is, that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas time, he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it: let the spirits be never so good, or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof, as those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin's cavern.' ...|$|R
40|$|A close {{relative}} of spotted knapweed in the Asteraceae taxonomic family, diffuse knapweed is typically biennial, reproducing exclusively by seed. It forms a rosette {{with a central}} crown and tap root in the juvenile stage and a single upright stem one to three feet (0. 3 to 0. 9 m) tall with numerous spreading branches at maturity. White (occasionally purple) flowers are borne in heads with spiny bracts (see Figure 1). It is generally found on more arid sites than spotted knapweed. Native to the Mediterranean region, diffuse knapweed was first recorded in Montana from Mineral County in 1951 and by 2008 had been reported from 39 of Montana’s 56 counties. Its dense, spiny overstory reduces the availability of desirable forage plants to livestock and wildlife, and grass production can be reduced by over 90 % in heavy infestations. Declines in diffuse knapweed populations in western North America {{have been attributed to}} the lesser knapweed flower weevil (Larinus minutus), one of 14 approved biological control insects it is host to. Herbicidal management can best be achieved by application of any of the following chemicals at the rosette to bolt stages: aminopyralid, clopyralid, dicamba, picloram, and 2, 4 -D. Grazing management using sheep or goats should be applied during the rosette and bolt stages before the formation of spiny flowerheads, and animals should be removed when 50 % of grass forage has been utilized. Tillage can be used to remove plants and release the seed bank. Persistent hand pulling and <b>grubbing</b> <b>may</b> be practical on small scale infestations. Diffuse knapweed re-sprouts following fire, including intense wildfire. Cultivating and re-vegetating competitive plants will improve the longevity of control applications and reduce re-establishment from the seed bank.

40|$|Digenetic trematodes infest {{many types}} of fish and are common in cultured fish in areas frequented by {{fish-eating}} birds. In the past, most trematode infestations in cultured channel catfish were caused by either Clinostomum complanatum (“yellow grubs”) or Diplostomum spathaceum (“eye flukes”). Such infestations are rarely more than a nuisance, though severe infestations of yellow <b>grub</b> <b>may</b> make fish unsuitable for processing. Recently, a digenetic trematode identified as Bolbophorus sp. (hereafter referred to only as Bolbophorus) {{has been reported in}} commercially raised channel catfish from Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. Evidence indicates that Bolbophorus infestations have caused high mortality rates and decreased production in channel catfish. The management strategies discussed here for the control of Bolbophorus apply to other digenetic trematodes with similar life cycles. and two intermediate hosts. The life cycle (Fig. 1) begins when the adult trematode, which lives in the gastrointestinal tract of the American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), releases eggs that are then deposited into ponds when the birds defecate. The eggs hatch to produce miracidia that infest the first intermediate host, the ram’s horn snail (Helisoma sp., Fig. 2). The miracidia mature in the snail and eventually release larval trematodes called cercariae. The cercariae infest and encyst in fish to form metacercariae (Fig. 3). The life cycle is completed when pelicans eat infected fish and metacercariae develop into adult flukes. Trematode life cycle Pelican (adult fluke) Some digenetic trematodes may have several different final and intermediate hosts. Studies to date, however, indicate that the only final and intermediate host for Bolbophorus are the pelican and the ram’s horn snail, respectively. Without these hosts the life cycle of the trematode cannot be completed. Many different species of fish-eating birds from locations across North America have been necropsied and examined for the presence of Bolbophorus. Some of the birds sampled were from ponds in Louisiana and northwestern Mississippi containing severel...|$|R
