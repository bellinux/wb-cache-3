50|$|The Picher area {{became the}} most {{productive}} lead-zinc mining field in the Tri-State district, producing over $20 billion worth of ore between 1917 and 1947. More than {{fifty percent of the}} lead and zinc metal used during World War I were produced by the Picher district. At its peak more than 14,000 miners worked the mines and another 4,000 worked in mining services. Many workers commuted by an extensive trolley system {{from as far away as}} Joplin and Carthage, Missouri. Mining ceased in 1967 and water pumping from the mines ceased. The contaminated water from some 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of <b>mill</b> <b>sand</b> and sludge remained as a huge environmental cleanup problem. As a result of national legislation to identify and remediate such environmentally hazardous sites, in 1980 the area was designated as part of the Tar Creek Superfund site.|$|E
40|$|The {{first two}} {{prototype}} lunar regolith simulants were to replicate {{characteristics of the}} lunar highlands. A major change from initial plans was to use an estimate of typical Apollo 16 highland material rather than a specific core. This change was compatible with project objectives and necessitated {{by the lack of}} adequate data from a single core. To make the initial simulant, a crystalline component and a glass component were deemed necessary. Lithic feedstocks were obtained {{with the assistance of the}} Stillwater Mining Company. The mixing of the rock constituents was done based on normative mineralogy rather than modal mineralogy. This was done to simplify development. A major design decision was not to attempt simulation of the range of glass chemistries observed in Apollo samples. A single glass was assumed to be adequate for engineering purposes for which the simulant would be used. Glass was made in a process developed at Zybek Advanced Products of Boulder, Colorado. <b>Mill</b> <b>sand</b> was used as the feedstock for this process. A second generation of the simulant was made that incorporated the additional minerals apatite, synthetic whitlockite, and pyrite.

30|$|Cutting {{force is}} one of the {{research}} hotspots in direct <b>sand</b> mould <b>milling</b> because the cutting force directly affects the machining quality and tool wear. Unlike metals, sand mould is a heterogeneous discrete deposition material. There is still a lack of theoretical research on the cutting force. In order to realize the prediction and control of the cutting force in the <b>sand</b> mould <b>milling</b> process, an analytical model of cutting force is proposed based on the unequal division shear zone model of orthogonal cutting. The deformation velocity relations of the chip within the orthogonal cutting shear zone are analyzed first. According to the flow behavior of granular, the unequal division shear zone model of sand mould is presented, in which the governing equations of shear strain rate, strain and velocity are established. The constitutive relationship of quasi-solid–liquid transition is introduced to build the 2 D constitutive equation and deduce the cutting stress in the mould shear zone. According to the cutting geometric relations of up milling with straight cutting edge and the transformation relationship between cutting stress and cutting force, the dynamic cutting forces are predicted for different milling conditions. Compared with the experimental results, the predicted results show good agreement, indicating that the predictive model of cutting force in <b>milling</b> <b>sand</b> mould is validated. Therefore, the proposed model can provide the theoretical guidance for cutting force control in high efficiency <b>milling</b> <b>sand</b> mould.|$|R

A total of 15 aggregate sources from five different regions in China were selected and tested using a specially-designed device stationed at the State Key Laboratory of Tribology in Tsinghua University. A total of 4 groups of experimental tests were performed to measure the aggregate frictional coefficients under different testing conditions. In the first group, a total of 25 tests were performed to study the impact of loading levels and rotational velocities of the rolling shaft on the measured frictional coefficients. The second and third groups of tests were conducted to study the dry and wet friction at the surfaces between the aggregate specimens and the outer ring of the rolling shaft with the <b>milled</b> <b>sands</b> pretreated. The fourth group of tests was performed to measure the dry friction at the surfaces between the aggregate specimens and the outer ring with the car tire rubber pretreated. From the experimental test results for most aggregate sources, it was observed that: 1) in the second and third groups of tests, both wet and dry frictional coefficients sharply increased at the beginning, then after their peak values the dry frictional coefficients kept constant while the wet frictional coefficients decreased smoothly over the testing time; 2) the wet frictional coefficients were lower than the dry frictional coefficients; 3) the dry frictional coefficients at the surfaces between aggregates and the <b>milled</b> <b>sands</b> were smaller than those at the surfaces between aggregates and the car tire rubber.

30|$|One of {{the reasons}} for this was {{expected}} to be the oil contamination during the filtration stage due to the possible leakage of lubricant oil from the larox filter pressing stage; hence, the same larox lubricating oil, RENOLIN B, grade 46 was doped with the pigment during filtration. Another source for oil contamination is from the <b>sand</b> <b>mills</b> during the grinding process.

It has been observed that the gyration motion {{plays an important role in}} the power consumption of cohesive powders. The relation between a modified power number(N-pM=P/rho(b) u(ch) (3) d(s) (2)) and a modified Froude number (Fr-M = u(ch) (2) /gd(s)) used in several previous publications is adapted and shown to depend on powder cohesion. These dimensionless numbers are built on the basis of a characteristic speed an, a characteristic length d(s), the bulk density rho(b) and the power consumption A. The filling ratio f is also taken in account. For a free flowing powder, of cohesion smaller than 0. 3 kPa, N-pM= a(f) center dot F-rM(- 1) while for a more cohesive powder, of cohesion higher than 0. 6 kPa the correlation N-pM= 6 center dot F-rM(b(f)) is more appropriate. For both equations, a and b are powder-dependent parameters. Their linear dependency on the filling ratio of the blender has been established. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

One of the causes of that fact is that lots of brands have become this aspect into their hallmark; a clear example is the red of Ferrari or the green of Jaguar. Thus, {{due to the fact that}} exists a continuous competence between companies to be the industry leader, paints suffer a fast and continuous evolution process to provide better protection and larger range of colours and effects. That is the reason why AkzoNobel, leading global company headquartered in Amsterdam, has decided to carry out a project to study the gloss stability of matte clearcoats due to their increasing demand. This is a hard task even for the most experienced technicians. That is because these clearcoats are characterized by having a hard gloss adjust due to their non-linear performance on the addition of matting agents. By this study, it is expected to achieve a better comprehension of how the gloss is affected by the coat thickness and by the time. In addition, it is also studied if these clearcoats show good painting reproducibility related to the liquid product stability. For this study, the performance of four currently used clearcoats will be observed and compared in order to determine which of them is the best.
