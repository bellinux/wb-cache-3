In this paper, {{we have developed}} a model based on Master-Slave Design Pattern of mobile agent systems called Master-V-Slave (MVS) model throughout a computational agent, namely (V-agent). The proposed model utilizes V-agent to analyze a new computing model, namely Message Broadcast Model (MBM) for managing broadcast messages between a set of <b>master</b> <b>agents</b> carrying out tasks {{on a set of}} clients and corresponding slave agents receiving and performing tasks within a predefined allocating time on a set of servers. We analyzed the MBM using Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) to optimize and minimize message time performance distribution architecture. Furthermore, we implemented a prototyping scenario of MBM that computes total number of expected delivery messages from a set of <b>master</b> <b>agents</b> to set of slave agents based on slave time message response with V-agent. Our proposed model could potentially exploit Message Delivery/Response Matrix (MDRM) based on MBM that can be integrated with parallel distributing computing systems and knowingly analyses approaches in operations research.

Several DIET platforms are shared by interconnecting their respective <b>Master</b> <b>Agent</b> (MA). Clients request available SeDs from their MA as usual. If the MA finds an available SeD able to resolve the problem, it returns its reference to the client. If it does not find a SeD, it forwards the request to other MAs which can also forward it to other ones, and so on. When a MA finds a SeD which can resolve the client's request, it returns its reference to the client's MA which returns the reference to the client. The client can then use that SeD to resolve its problem.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a multi-agent system which {{performs}} speculative computation under incomplete communication environments. In a master-slave style multi-agent system with speculative computation, a <b>master</b> <b>agent</b> asks queries to slave agents in problem solving, and proceeds computation with default answers when answers from slave agents are delayed. We rst provide a semantics for speculative computation using default logic. Then, {{in the proposed}} system, we use the consequence- nding procedure SOL written in the Java language to perform data-driven deductive reasoning. The use of a consequence- nding procedure is convenient for updating agents' beliefs according to situation changes in the world. In our system, slave agents can change their answers frequently, yet a <b>master</b> <b>agent</b> can avoid duplicate computation. As long as actual answers from slave agents do not con- ict with any previously encountered situation, the obtained conclusions are never recomputed.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is the design of an {{intelligent}} coordinator (IC) of fuzzy controller-agents (FCAs) to control indoor environmental conditions in buildings by using a 3 -D fuzzy comfort set. The basic factors that participate in the control of indoor environmental conditions are the controllers and users ’ comfort requirements. Harmonization of these factors results in energy saving, and occupants ’ comfort, both very significant. Synchronization of the control system is obtained by the design and implementation of an intelligent coordinator, which is a centralized one. It consists of a <b>master</b> <b>agent</b> and a slave agent that are both implemented by fuzzy logic theory. <b>Master</b> <b>agent</b> evaluates the energy efficiency of the building and comfort of occupants. A fuzzy inference mechanism produces signals that activate the slave agent and change the set points of the controllers. The slave agent is a fuzzy negotiation machine (FNM), which synchronizes the interaction of the FCAs and manages to avoid conflicts between them. When some conditions determined by the slave agent are satisfied FCAs are activated, otherwise they stay inactive. The ultimate goal is the harmonization of all factors that contribute for control of ambient intelligent environments. In addition, the hardware architecture that implements the proposed intelligent system for multi zone buildings is presented. Finally, the applicability of the suggested system is demonstrated via TRNSYS-MATLAB computer simulation...|$|E
