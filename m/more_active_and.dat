5|$|After {{the death}} of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the {{archbishop}} of Vidin {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople to demonstrate his independence. Due to its geographical position, Vidin was initially safe from attacks by the Ottoman Turks who were ravaging the Balkans to the south and Ivan Sratsimir made no attempts to assist Ivan Shishman in his struggle against the Ottomans. Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did his policy become <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in Bursa where he was probably strangled. Although his son Constantine II claimed the title Emperor of Bulgaria and at times controlled some parts of his father's realm, Ivan Sratsimir is generally regarded by historians as the last ruler of medieval Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were <b>more</b> <b>active,</b> <b>and</b> were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species tend to be <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> pause for shorter times.|$|E
5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps because they are <b>more</b> <b>active</b> <b>and</b> thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both {{during the day and}} at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
