40|$|Accelerated {{trends of}} {{digitalisation}} and media convergence {{contribute to an}} increasingly important role of radio in modern society. In the last decade, {{we have seen in}} the field of radio broadcasting in the Republic of Slovenia an overwhelming expansion of radio broadcasters who acquired the radio broadcasting licences. The topic of this paper are issued radio broadcasting licences and granted statuses of station of special importance within radio broadcasting activity. Based on our own research of secondary data obtained from the documentation of co-regulators in the field of broadcasting for the period from 2004 to 2014, we attempted to identify the modus operandi of radio broadcasters in their everyday practice after acquiring the licences and statuses. Findings of our research indicate that the radio broadcasters over the period considered have often changed programme-related requirements and limitations resulting from their licences and the Mass Media Act, while broadcasting and distributing programming contents. In comparison with the <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences,</b> they did not transfer the broadcasting right to another legal entity so frequently. It has been also established that the regulator in ten cases temporarily had revoked the broadcasting licences or decided to withdraw the statuses, because the irregularities were detected during expert supervision. The authors set out proposals for the improvement of the situation in the subject field, based on the obtained results. They consider that it could be a challenge for all broadcasting stakeholders, who however have to tackle the elimination of the multi-annual delay of the harmonisation of the broadcasting sector with the standards of European Union. According to the results of the present study, the stakeholders cannot be satisfied with the situation in Slovenian media landscape and with its development nowadays...|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to regulatory references, the CC's role was {{dictated by the}} relevant sector-specific legislation. Companies regulated under the gas, electricity, water and sewerage, postal services, railways or airports legislation generally had a formal instrument (a licence) setting out the terms of their operation. If a regulated company did not agree to a <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> its <b>licence</b> proposed by the regulator, the regulator was required to refer the question to the CC. The CC then considered whether any matter {{referred to in the}} reference could be expected to operate against the public interest and, if so, whether it could be remedied by modifications to the licence. These references could involve the price control applied to the company.|$|R
40|$|Organisational {{policies}} express {{constraints on}} generation and processing of resources. However, application domains rely on transformation processes, {{which are in}} principle orthogonal to policy specifications and domain rules and policies may evolve in a non-synchronised way. In previous papers, we have proposed annotations as a flexible way to model aspects of some policy, and showed how they {{could be used to}} impose constraints on domain configurations, how to derive application conditions on transformations, and how to annotate complex patterns. We extend the approach by: allowing domain model elements to be annotated with collections of elements, which can be collectively applied to individual resources or collections thereof; proposing an original construction {{to solve the problem of}} annotations remaining orphan, when annotated resources are consumed; introducing a notion of contract, by which a policy imposes additional pre-conditions and post-conditions on rules for deriving new resources. We discuss a concrete case study of linguistic resources, annotated with information on the licenses under which they can be used. The annotation framework allows forms of reasoning such as identifying conflicts among licenses, enforcing the presence of licenses, or ruling out some <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> a <b>licence</b> configuration...|$|R

The law, approved on January 20, 2014, allows {{the use of the}} 5 MHz spectrum from 5418 to 5430 kHz, a continuous 12 kHz-wide segment. The allocation is as a secondary user as per ITU RR 4.4 regulations, with the emphasis on its use in nets during emergencies - as Cuba is {{in the path of the}} Caribbean Hurricanes every year, this band provides a stable communication path for the island. The new law allows for everyday use, but once an Official Emergency is declared by the Cuban State then purely emergency traffic is permitted. Modes allowed are SSB, CW and Digital, the latter being limited to PSK31 and PSK63. All three Cuban licence categories can access the band based on Maximum Powers of 10W for Novices and 50W for all Other Licensees with a relaxation of this power limitation of up to 100W for all users in emergency conditions as needed for a reliable link establishment. ACS, the Cuban regulator, states that the allocation is for emergencies & experimentation. Access to this band is by individual operators requesting and obtaining approval from the authority which results in the <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> the amateur's <b>licence.</b>|$|R
