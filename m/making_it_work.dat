5|$|Eleusis is {{probably}} Abbott's most prominent game, {{due to its}} metaphors and its suitability {{for use as a}} teaching tool. He invented it in 1956, and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games. It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later. Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June1959 issue of Scientific American. Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis; the result was considered to be far better than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> quite a bit better. Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October1977 issue of Scientific American. Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis. It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games, among others.|$|E
500|$|During the {{post-production}} of the film, Bakshi {{found that}} the cost of the optical effect required to complete live-action scenes with animated characters was larger than the film's budget. In order to complete these scenes cost effectively, Bakshi and his camera man Ted C. Bemiller purchased a 35 mm camera to project the footage onto the glass under the animation camera, which was reflected onto where the animation was shot. The same technique was used for the rotoscoped scenes in The Lord of the Rings. According to Bakshi, [...] "The illusion I attempted to create was that of a completely live-action film. <b>Making</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> almost drove us crazy." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
