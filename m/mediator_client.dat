This prototype adopts a three-tier architecture and includes three main components: GRI wrapper for distributed GRI web sites, GRI integration <b>mediator</b> and <b>client</b> side visualization interface. In this prototype, XML {{is used as a}} communication protocol between distributed web sites that provide GRI and the mediator, and between the <b>mediator</b> and <b>clients.</b> Java Servlets are written to translate data in distributed websites into XML documents. Data in distributed websites can be stored in a flat file, relational database, object-oriented database or objectrelational database. Java Servlet in the mediator server retrieves data from related distributed websites in an XML format upon a request from the client side, parses the retrieved XML documents, performs merge or other operations on the retrieved XML documents to build a new XML document and sends it to the client side. When the client side gets the requested data from the mediator server, it will parse the returned XML document and draw it inside the browser window by using a Java applet...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Three join {{algorithms}} {{are evaluated}} {{in an environment}} with distributed main-memory based mediators and data sources. A streamed ship-out join ships bulks of tuples to a mediator near a data source, followed by post-processing in the client. An extended streamed semi-join in addition builds a main-memory hash index in the <b>client</b> <b>mediator.</b> A ship-in algorithm materializes and joins the data in the <b>client</b> <b>mediator.</b> The first two algorithms are suitable for sources that require parameters to execute a query, as web search engines and computational software, and the last is suitable otherwise. We compare the execution times for obtaining all and the first N tuples, and analyze the percentage time spent in subsystems, varying the network communication speed, bulk size, and data duplicates. The join algorithm leads to orders of magnitude performance difference in different mediation environments. ...|$|R

In respect to security and privacy, the AAI acts as a <b>mediator</b> within the <b>client</b> service provider relationship, or, more likely, the client federation relation. Since an AAI is a loosely coupled combination of services architectural decisions influence its effects on privacy and security focusing either on customer demands or service provider requirements.

INTEGRATING DIGITAL LIBRARIES Nowadays, there is a trend to integrate several digital libraries to offer richer information.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{composition}} of Web services to create mashups has been achieved by using an application server as a <b>mediator</b> between a <b>client</b> browser and services. To avoid this bottleneck, mashups are sometimes implemented so that Web service composition takes place directly from the end user’s browser. Creating such implementations is difficult because developers must manage the separation of software into various distributable pieces, in different lan-guages, and coordinate their communication. In this pa-per we describe a middleware for managing Web service mashups in a disciplined, and flexible way. We build upon the established abstraction of XML pipelines, but describe a new approach for selectively partitioning pipeline compo-nents between a browser client and application server. We provide a performance evaluation for a common mashup application scenario. 1...|$|R

Thus, having efficient solutions for traffic measurement and monitoring supports {{a good deal of}} their business and it is essential to fair development of Internet. However, even if service management is well recognized, QoS strategies must evolve from circuit switching technological framework towards next generation networks and convergent services concepts. Standardizing IP traffic measurement is a requirement for interoperable service aware management systems upon which future Internet business would be based. A few projects have recently tackled the task of building rich infrastructures to provide IP traffic measurements. The European project MOMENT approach combines SOA and semantic search concepts: a <b>mediator</b> between <b>clients</b> and measurement tools has been designed in order to offer integrated access to the infrastructures, regardless their specific details, with the possibility of achieving complex queries. Pervasiveness of ontologies has been used for various purposes in the project. As such, one ontology deals traffic measurement data, another one describes metadata that is used instead of data for practical reasons, a third one focuses on anonymization required for ethical (and legal) restrictions and the las...|$|R

We show how mobile code {{can be used}} to ensure condentiality of data in a secure mediation system. We analyze what advantages mobile code has over mobile data for secure mediation. We present a Java implementation of a system that mediates SQL queries. Security risks for the client and the mobile code are delineated; oending the integrity of its own data is identied as a special type of attack of mobile code in a mediation system. We name appropriate countermeasures and describe the amount of trust needed in our system. As an extension, we consider security in a hierarchy of mediators. Finally, we combine mobile code with mobile agent technology. ...|$|R

This article explores recent changes in disputants’ conflict behaviour, together with potential implications for practitioner skills, strategies, values and training. It will provide some theoretical frameworks related to conflict behaviour and conflict ideologies that can be applied to practice. Recent developments in electronic and social mass media communications are explored, together with the impact these have had on conflict patterns in dispute resolution. It considers the extent to which developments in conflict behaviour may need to be challenged more overtly by mediators, for example through a more pro-active mentoring dialogue, including in individual pre-mediation meetings. Finally it offers some recommendations as to how such challenges and ideas for change, can be utilised {{in a way that does}} not impair the quality of the <b>client</b> <b>mediator</b> relationship...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} work on determining efficient joins for mediator systems. Mediator sys-tems have to dynamically integrate {{the results of}} multiple sources in a timely and efficient fashion. Thus, a {{focus has been on}} the ability to produce initial results early and to handle network latency and blocking. The issue of limited client capa-bilities and its impact on join algorithm selection has not been examined. A mediator system may be a large database system in itself or as small as a PDA, cellphone, or embedded Java applet on a web page. It is these smaller, dynamic mediator systems that hold promise of rapid integration of web resources. In this work, we examine several of the existing join methods under the context of supporting thin <b>client</b> <b>mediators</b> which have lim-ited memory, CPU, or disk space. Somewhat sur-prisingly, the basic sort-merge join applies excep-tionally well to this environment with its paral-lel exploitation of server resources and minimal client resource constraints. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{democratization of}} {{ubiquitous}} computing (access data anywhere, anytime, anyhow), the increasing connection of corporate databases to the Internet and the today's natural resort to Webhosting companies strongly emphasize {{the need for}} data confidentiality. Database servers arouse user's suspicion because no one can fully trust traditional security mechanisms against more and more frequent and malicious attacks {{and no one can}} be fully confident on an invisible DBA administering confidential data. This paper gives an in-depth analysis of existing security solutions and concludes on the intrinsic weakness of the traditional server-based approach to preserve data confidentiality. With this statement in mind, we propose a solution called C-SDA (Chip-Secured Data Access), which enforces data confidentiality and controls personal privileges thanks to a clientbased security component acting as a <b>mediator</b> between a <b>client</b> and an encrypted database. This component is embedded in a smartcard to prevent any tampering to occur. This cooperation of hardware and software security components constitutes a strong guarantee against attacks threatening personal as well as business data...|$|R
30|$|The {{adoption}} of software {{fault tolerance techniques}} based on design diversity has been advocated {{as a means of}} coping with residual software design faults in operational software (Lee and Anderson [1990]). Design diversity is the provision of software components called variants, which have the same or an equivalent specification but with different designs and implementations (Gärtner [1999]). An assumption of software fault tolerance techniques is that the probability of having the same fault in multiple variant components is lower, meaning that a fault present in a component should be detected and tolerated based on the behaviour of other variants (Lyu [1996]). In the nineties, the use of techniques based on design diversity to tolerate software faults was widely criticised since variant software components used to be developed from scratch, which is very expensive (Anderson et al. [1985]; Vouk et al. [1993]). Therefore these techniques were generally used only in highly critical systems, in which the occurrence of failures would result in large financial losses or even loss of life. Nevertheless, in the context of SOA on the web, there are already many services that provide equivalent functionality, thus making such techniques more practical (Zheng and Lyu [2010 b]). These variant services might be simply cost-free and open access, or even offered by external organizations to cope with changes to user quality of services (QoS) requirements (Papazoglou et al. [2007]). Due to the low cost of reusing existing variant services, several diversity-based approaches have been developed to support reliable SOA-based applications. These approaches operate as <b>mediators</b> between <b>clients</b> and variant services. The latter are structured in fault-tolerant composite web services (Nascimento et al. [2011]; Zheng and Lyu [2010 b]). Hereafter we refer to fault-tolerant composite web services as FT-compositions. From the clients’ viewpoint, an FT-composition works as a single, reliable service.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{generate}} a theory of what happens between the body of the therapist and the body of the client in a psychotherapeutic setting. This was achieved through documenting and analysing first-hand therapists’ experiences of their own embodied being in the psychotherapeutic process. A descriptive phenomenological design was adopted using a grounded theory methodology. Participants were experienced psychological therapists, nine of whom were female and three of whom were male. Through use of semi-structured interviews the research captured therapists’ direct experience of their embodied interaction with clients. It was discovered that at any given juncture the body of the therapist registers a considerable amount of intersubjective somatic information. The Core Category of Between Bodies emerged from this analysis and this is divided into five sub-categories. These include (i) Body to Body (ii) Connection (iii) Somatic Experiencing of Other (iv) Embodied Process and (v) Intersubjective Space. Findings describe a theoretically salient Implicit Relational Model of what happens between bodies in the psychotherapeutic encounter. Movement to and between each of the sub-categories is mediated by the embodied processes of the first sub-category Body to Body. These embodied relational processes are co-created and act as a <b>mediator</b> between <b>client</b> and therapist for generating one or more of the sub-categories Connection, Somatic Experiencing of Other, Embodied Process and Intersubjective Space. This research study highlights the importance of exploring and attending to implicit processes. The findings are discussed in relation to current research on neuroscience and infant studies. Such theory will add to knowledge and understanding of the implicit intersubjective field of the therapeutic relationship. It will also help to inform specific recommendations for supervisors, trainers, therapists and researchers...|$|R

40|$|Selecting {{the most}} {{relevant}} Web Service according to a client requirement is an onerous task, as there are innumerous functionally same Web Services (WS) {{that are able to}} satisfy the request of user. However non-functional attributes also matter a lot. A web Service Selection Process involves two major points: Recommending the pertinent Web Service and avoiding unjustifiable web service. The deficiency in keyword based searching is that it doesn’t handle the client request accurately. UDDI and search engines are based on keyword search, which is insufficient for providing the relevant service. So the search mechanism must be incorporated with the Semantic behavior of Web Services. In order to strengthen this approach, the proposed model is incorporated with Quality of Services (QoS) based Ranking of web services. This paper enlightens on various concepts of Quality of Service associated with web services. Various QoS parameters like performance, availability, reliability and stability etc. are formalized in order to enhance the pertinence of web service selection. A QoS mediator agent based Web Service Selection Model is proposed where QoS Consultant acts as a <b>Mediator</b> Agent between <b>clients</b> and service providers. Model suggests user’s preferences on QoS parameter selection. The proposed model helps to select pertinent Web Service as per user’s requirement and reduce the human intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{contributions}} that twelve classifications of presenting problems and the counseling relationship make in determining client satisfaction with counseling in a college counseling center context. Participants were 155 undergraduate and graduate students who engaged in counseling during the Fall, 1997, semester at a large southwestern university counseling center. Data utilized in this study was archival. A recursive, just-identified path model was developed. Multiple regression analyses were used and the maximum likelihood estimation method was applied to the structural equation model. Analysis of Moment Structures (Amos; Arbuckle, 1995) was utilized in the analysis of the structural model. Findings from the study supported one classification of presenting problem (issues related to romantic relationship difficulties) as being an indirect predictor of client satisfaction via its effects on the counseling relationship. When the presenting problem of anxiety was studied in isolation, it was shown to be a significant predictor of client satisfaction. Personally-related problems were identified as four times as influential on client satisfaction than were academic and vocational problems. Findings also attested to the important role of the counseling relationship as a significant predictor of client satisfaction and as a <b>mediator</b> variable between <b>clients</b> 2 ̆ 7 presenting problems and their satisfaction with counseling. Based on these findings, implications for practice include the importance of counselors being highly skilled in building therapeutic relationships with clients and the possibility of modifying the counseling process used with clients addressing vocational and academic issues to more similarly reflect the process in place with clients addressing personally-related issues. Such modification may serve to increase client satisfaction. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{repeated measures}} {{study was designed}} to evaluate and compare the ffectiveness of volunteer support versus traditional case management for those with HIV in improving level of independent functioning. A non-random sample of one hundred and fifty-three clients (eighty-two in professional, seventy-one in the volunteer program) participated in the study. Evaluative tools utilized included a Checklist of Needs and Level of Independent Functioning Scale (LIF). It was predicted that volunteer case managers would be more effective than professionals in improving the independent functioning of clients with HIV and mental health/drug and alcohol problems. It was also predicted that volunteers would be more effective than professionals in assisting clients with obtaining a greater percentage of outside needs (needs provided by other agencies and defined as more critical in increasing independence). Multivariate analyses of data collected were used to test for relationships between two case management interventions (independent variables), time spent with <b>clients</b> (<b>mediator)</b> and two outcome (dependent) variables, level of independent functioning and percentage of outside needs met. Results supported the prediction that clients of volunteers improved their level of independent functioning and had more outside needs met than clients in the professional group. Path analyses revealed that increased time spent by volunteers (total time, number of contacts) partially mediated improvement in level of independent functioning. Face to face time, the most intense form of time, appeared to fully mediate the relationship between independent and dependent variables. However, the time variables did not mediate the relationship between type of intervention and outside needs met. Recommendations were made for agencies to consider utilizing volunteers in a professional capacity. Also, the evaluative tools developed for this study may be useful to demonstrate outcomes to support lobbying efforts for increased funding. Future research could focus on further refining the LIF scale...|$|R
