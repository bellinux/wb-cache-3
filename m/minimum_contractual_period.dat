We first propose a means to define and quantify the flexibility of a commercial building.

Alvarez agreed on principle to a new contract with the UFC, reportedly including a share of pay-per-view revenue in addition to show and win money. Bellator, however, invoked a clause in the original contract to match the UFC's offer and re-sign Alvarez, matching the show and win purse and alleging that the pay-per-view cut in the UFC's offer to be strictly hypothetical.

A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all flat-rate allowances.

30|$|Regarding wages, {{the wage}} setting system in Portugal {{is common to}} both native and {{immigrant}} workers irrespective {{of the type of}} contract (permanent or fixed-term). This framework is mainly determined by three thresholds and there is not an automatic wage indexation mechanism (see (Carneiro et al. 2012) for {{a detailed description of the}} Portuguese wage setting system in this period). First, the lower limit is defined, at the national level, through the legal mechanism of the minimum wage. Second, nominal base wage cuts in the private sector are forbidden by law. Finally, in the context of wage bargaining, the majority of the lower wage limits for each professional group are defined by sectoral agreements, as firm agreements are the exception. Afterwards, the Ministry of Labour extends the collective agreements to the workers initially not covered, so the distinction between union and non-union membership is largely meaningless in Portugal. Whatever the <b>minimum</b> <b>contractual</b> wage levels set by collective bargaining, firms are free to pay higher wages and they often deviate from that benchmark (Cardoso and Portugal 2005).|$|R

Although Europeans are often physically removed from the locations where {{and the ways in which}} the goods they buy are made, the knowledge thereof is often not so remote. Indeed, as a topic of debate, cases involving deplorable production conditions have proven to be structural and persistent over time, receiving media, political, and academic attention, raising broad moral concern. This dissertation takes the example of transactions for goods made in sweatshops to raise questions regarding the minimum standards applicable to market conduct in Europe. It argues from a capabilities perspective to <b>minimum</b> <b>contractual</b> justice that a society aiming to be minimally just should not support market activities that have adverse effects on the central capabilities of others elsewhere. As such, the book provides reasons of justice for why economic transactions for goods made in sweatshops should be considered immoral and for that reason invalid under rules of contract law in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Outsourcing of {{logistics}} {{activities is}} a popularly employed logistics strategy by many industries within the South African context. However, {{it is not}} fully understood what is required to ensure the sustainability of such a strategy. More specifically, the alignment of the logistics service provider and the customer is not fully understood. Customers adhere to strict procurement policies, which often result in short <b>contractual</b> <b>periods,</b> while logistics service providers aim to generate proper returns during these short <b>contractual</b> <b>periods.</b> Customers and logistics service providers require assistance in structuring the approach to a logistics outsourcing arrangement to ensure {{the success of the}} transaction. This study aims to develop a framework or roadmap to be used by customers and logistics service providers either considering to enter a logistics outsourcing arrangement or already committed to such an arrangement. The framework will provide guidance to both parties to ensure that the arrangement achieves the objectives of a modern-day logistics outsourcing arrangement. The objectives of a successful logistics outsourcing arrangement include: ensuring the sustainability of the arrangement; meeting the expectations of both parties; achieving joint and own objectives; ensuring a fair price; extending the duration of the contract; and ensuring that on termination the arrangement ends amicably. The framework is developed by means of an in-depth analysis of the life cycle of a logistics outsourcing arrangement within the South African context. Each phase within the life cycle is investigated by means of industry interviews, questionnaires, case studies and equity research. Factors affecting the success of logistics outsourcing arrangements are identified. Subsequently, possible solutions are recalled from existing research, or developed and tested to aid both parties in identifying and managing these factors throughout the life cycle. These solutions include methods for dealing with the insource versus outsource and supplier selection decisions and a method of managing detrimental behaviour of the customer and logistics service provider within the arrangement.

The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law or by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.|$|R

The paper {{presents}} {{the provisions of}} Directive 2011 / 7 /EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions by virtue of which the EU Member States are obliged to limit the contractual freedom in contracts between undertakings. The Directive’s rules on the <b>contractual</b> payment <b>period</b> of 60 calendar days and on the exceptionally longer <b>contractual</b> payment <b>period,</b> {{as well as on}} payment schedules providing for instalments, are also analysed. The author argues the position that, if the payment period is not fixed in the contract but the contract stipulates that the determination of the payment period is left to the will of one of the contracting parties, then such unilaterally decided payment period should be considered as the payment period fixed in the contract {{in the sense of the}} provisions of Directive 2011 / 7 /EU.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the impact of mutual firms on {{competition}} in the insurance market. We distinguish two actors in this market: mutual firms, which belong to their pooled members, and traditional companies, which belong to their shareholders. Our approach differs from the literature by one crucial assumption: the expected utility of the consumers depends on the size of their insurance firm, which generates network externalities in this market. Thus, the choice of a contract results in a trade-off between the premium level and the probability of that premium being ex-post adjusted. The optimal contract offered by a mutual firm involves a systematic ex-post adjustment (negative or positive), while the contracts a company offers imply a fixed premium that is possibly negatively adjusted at the end of the <b>contractual</b> <b>period.</b> In an oligopoly game, we show that three types of configurations are possible at equilibrium: either one mutual firm or insurance company is active, or a mixed structure emerges in which two or more companies share the market with or without a mutual firm.
