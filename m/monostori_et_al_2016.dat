30|$|A few common {{industrial}} wastewater remediation methods include ozonation, membrane filtration, adsorption (Kooh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> b), ion-exchange (Naushad <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015) and phytoremediation (Kooh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> c). Adsorption {{is the most}} popular water remediation method (Wang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011) due to its simple remediation process and can be adopted by any textile mill without the need of advanced knowledge. The cost of the water treatment depends on the type of adsorbent and its adsorption efficiency. Examples of low-cost alternatives may include soil materials such as peat (Chieng <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015), abundant weeds (Lim <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016),</b> or wastes derived from agriculture or industries such as walnut shell (Dahri <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014), breadfruit peel (Lim <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014 b), soya waste (Kooh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015 a; Mital and Kurup 2006), dextrin (Mittal <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> b), alginate (Mittal <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> a, c), egg shell (Mittal <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> e), hibiscus fibre (Sharma <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015) and hen feather (Mittal and Mittal 2015).

30|$|Emission of SOx, {{originating}} from the combustion of sulfur compounds in fuel, {{has become an}} increasingly serious issue (Wu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> b; Zhao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Xiao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Lu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Gu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; He <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017). Thus, increasingly stringent regulations have been proposed (Xiao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; Jiang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Zhu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014 a; Xu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Zhu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013 c; Wu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> a). Generally, the sulfur contents in fuel are limited to < 10  ppm in many countries. To realize such a goal, higher requirements are needed in industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS), such as higher operating temperature and reaction pressure. However, the conventional HDS process is less efficient for aromatic sulfur compounds, making it a choke point for production of ultra-low sulfur fuel oil. Therefore, numerous substitute technologies have been developed, including extractive desulfurization (EDS) (Gao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; Li <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Zhao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016),</b> adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) (Xiao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Khan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; Xiong <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Xiao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013), biodesulfurization (BDS) (Ferreira <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Aksoy <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017 a), oxidative desulfurization (ODS) (Wu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016</b> a, 2017 a, b, 2018; Jiang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Xun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016),</b> etc. Among all the developed substitutes, ODS is a potential one because of its mild reaction conditions and high activity to aromatic sulfur compounds. The above advantages make ODS a promising complementary method to the HDS process (McNamara <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; Jiang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016,</b> 2017; Li <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Miao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2016).</b>|$|R
