5|$|Gallium nitrate (brand name Ganite) {{has been}} used as an {{intravenous}} pharmaceutical to treat hypercalcemia associated with tumor <b>metastasis</b> to bones. Gallium is thought to interfere with osteoclast function, and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{analysis}} of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma, a low-grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and <b>metastasis,</b> with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node <b>metastasis</b> and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metastasis</b> of {{lung cancer}} {{requires}} transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cell type. This may occur through activation of signaling pathways such as Akt/GSK3Beta, MEK-ERK, Fas, and Par6.|$|E
5|$|The {{evaluation}} of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM classification. This {{is based on}} the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and <b>metastasis.</b> A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and <b>metastasis</b> of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|Prophylactic cranial {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of radiotherapy to the brain, used {{to reduce}} the risk of <b>metastasis.</b> PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (<b>metastasis)</b> may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
25|$|A major use of {{systemic}} radioisotope therapy {{is in the}} treatment of bone <b>metastasis</b> from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used {{in the treatment of}} bone <b>metastasis</b> are strontium-89 and samarium (153Sm) lexidronam.|$|E
25|$|Involved {{in growth}} and <b>metastasis</b> of {{some types of}} tumors.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} sites of <b>metastasis</b> are the lung, {{abdominal}} lymph nodes, and bone.|$|E
25|$|M {{describes}} distant <b>metastasis</b> (spread {{of cancer}} {{from one part}} of the body to another).|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{mutations}} are cumulative {{and sometimes}} {{are related to}} disease stage. <b>Metastasis</b> and drug resistance are distinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The AJCC/TNM staging system {{indicates}} {{where the}} tumor has developed, spread to lymph nodes, and <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound of {{the abdomen}} and blood tests {{evaluating}} liver function are often performed {{to rule out}} <b>metastasis</b> to the liver.|$|E
25|$|C. l. <b>metastasis,</b> {{described}} by Richard Schodde in 1989, {{is found in}} southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|CSCs have {{implications}} for cancer therapy, including for disease identification, selective drug targets, prevention of <b>metastasis</b> and intervention strategies.|$|E
25|$|Stage II: {{the cancer}} {{involves}} the testis and <b>metastasis</b> to retroperitoneal and/or paraaortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes below the diaphragm).|$|E
25|$|Lung cancer* {{is usually}} the result of <b>metastasis</b> in dogs. Primary tumors are rare. The most common type is adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Initially, nearby {{lymph nodes}} are struck early. The lungs, liver, brain, and bones {{are the most}} common <b>metastasis</b> {{locations}} from solid tumors.|$|E
25|$|External {{irradiation}} may be {{used when}} the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from bone <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{is typical}} route of <b>metastasis</b> for sarcomas, {{but it is}} also the favored route for certain types of {{carcinoma}}, such as renal cell carcinoma originating in the kidney. Because of their thinner walls, veins are more frequently invaded than are arteries, and <b>metastasis</b> tends to follow the pattern of venous flow. That is, hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor. For example, colorectal cancer spreads primarily through the portal vein to the liver.|$|E
25|$|This path {{results in}} the {{accumulation}} of sulfatide in renal cancer cell lines. Additionally, sulfatide can accumulate {{on the surface of}} cancer cells. This indicates that sulfatide may serve as a specific ligand for P-selectin. This would contribute to increased <b>metastasis</b> of the cancer. However, {{more research is needed to}} elucidate the relationship between the elevated levels of sulfatide expression and the initiation and <b>metastasis</b> mechanisms of cancer, but sulfatide may be a useful serum biomarker for early tumor detection.|$|E
25|$|The Mx {{designation}} {{was removed}} from the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC system, but referred to cancers that could not be evaluated for distant <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{breast cancer}} {{presents}} as metastatic disease—that is, cancer that has spread beyond the original organ. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer {{will depend on}} the location of <b>metastasis.</b> Common sites of <b>metastasis</b> include bone, liver, lung and brain. Unexplained weight loss can occasionally signal breast cancer, as can symptoms of fevers or chills. Bone or joint pains can sometimes be manifestations of metastatic breast cancer, as can jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific, meaning they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Palliative care, care {{aimed at}} {{improving}} {{the quality of life of}} people with major illness, has been recommended as part of management programs for <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} distant <b>metastasis,</b> the cancer is {{generally}} considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many {{months or even years}} with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis. Survival is better with <b>metastasis</b> in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{are taken}} prior to surgery because {{about one in}} five cases of VAS will develop <b>metastasis,</b> usually to the lungs but {{possibly}} to the lymph nodes or skin.|$|E
25|$|Cases of SBO {{related to}} cancer are more {{complicated}} and require additional intervention to address the malignancy, recurrence, and <b>metastasis,</b> and thus are associated with poorer prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Bisphosphonates {{are used}} to treat osteoporosis, osteitis deformans (Paget's disease of the bone), bone <b>metastasis</b> (with or without hypercalcaemia), {{multiple}} myeloma, and other conditions involving fragile, breakable bone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metastasis</b> is {{the major}} cause of tumor lethality. However, not every tumor cell can metastasize. This {{potential}} depends on factors that determine growth, angiogenesis, invasion and other basic processes.|$|E
25|$|Most deaths due to {{colon cancer}} are {{associated}} with metastatic disease. A gene that appears {{to contribute to the}} potential for metastatic disease, <b>metastasis</b> associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), has been isolated. It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and <b>metastasis</b> in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in vitro}} and in vivo, ROS {{have been shown}} to induce {{transcription}} factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and <b>metastasis</b> (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN).|$|E
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Snail protein expression and a decrease in E-cadherin and Tight Junctions. Hedgehog signaling also appears to be a crucial regulator of angiogenesis and thus <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Metastasis</b> {{involves}} a complex {{series of steps}} in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate {{to other parts of}} the body via the bloodstream, via the lymphatic system, or by direct extension. To do so, malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues. By degrading these proteins, cancer cells are able to breach the ECM and escape. The location of the metastases is not always random, with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone. Breast cancer, for example, tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs. This specificity seems to be mediated by soluble signal molecules such as chemokines and transforming growth factor beta. The body resists <b>metastasis</b> by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as <b>metastasis</b> suppressors, of which about a dozen are known.|$|E
