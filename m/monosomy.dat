25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the absence of one complete or partial copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X (<b>monosomy)</b> (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of partial <b>monosomy</b> like a deletion of the short p arm of one X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) or the presence of an isochromosome with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq)) Turner syndrome has distinct features {{due to the lack of}} pseudoautosomal regions, which are typically spared from X-inactivation. In mosaic individuals, cells with X <b>monosomy</b> (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY). The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67â€“90%).|$|E

25|$|The term sex {{chromosome}} aneuploidy summarizes conditions with an abnormal number of {{sex chromosome}}s, i.e. other than XX (female) or XY (male). Formally, X chromosome <b>monosomy</b> (Turner syndrome, see above) {{can also be}} classified {{as a form of}} sex chromosome aneuploidy.|$|E
25|$|The {{only known}} survivable <b>monosomy</b> in humans is Turner syndrome, where the {{affected}} individual is monosomic for the X chromosome (see below). Other monosomies are usually lethal during early fetal development, and survival is only possible {{if not all}} {{the cells of the}} body are affected in case of a mosaicism (see below), or if the normal number of chromosomes is restored via duplication of the single monosomic chromosome ("chromosome rescue").|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where <b>monosomy</b> occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. Isochromosome X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.|$|E

The most common additional abnormalities are loss of the Y chromosome, + 8, +Ph, and i(17 q). Since these additional chromosome abnormalities are signs of disease progression, it is important to perform cytogenetic analyses periodically in patients with CML [1]. We have published our results on clonal chromosome abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome in Ph+ and Ph- cells of CML patients who were followed in our center a few years ago [2, 3]. <b>Monosomies</b> were the most frequently observed chromosome abnormalities in these reports.

50|$|Partial {{aneuploidy}} {{can also}} {{occur as a}} result of unbalanced translocations during meiosis. Deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial <b>monosomies,</b> while duplications can cause partial trisomies. If the duplication or deletion is large enough, it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual. Autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases, ranging from cancer to schizophrenia. Unlike single gene disorders, diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper gene dosage, not nonfunctional gene product.|$|R
25|$|About half of {{individuals}} with Turner syndrome have <b>monosomy</b> X (45,X), which means each cell in a woman's body has only one copy of the X chromosome {{instead of the usual}} two copies. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely missing. Some women with Turner syndrome have a chromosomal change in only some of their cells. These cases are called Turner syndrome mosaics (45,X/46,XX).|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} this error is a cell with an {{imbalance}} of chromosomes. Such a cell {{is said to be}} aneuploid. Loss of a single chromosome (2n-1), in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect will have one chromosome missing from one of its pairs, is referred to as a <b>monosomy.</b> Gaining a single chromosome, in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect will have one chromosome in addition to its pairs is referred to as a trisomy. In the event that an aneuploidic gamete is fertilized, a number of syndromes might result.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of FISH, in some centres only embryos are {{replaced}} that {{are found to be}} chromosomally normal (that is, showing two signals for the gonosomes and the analysed autosomes) after the analysis of one or two blastomeres, and when two blastomeres are analysed, the results should be concordant. Other centres argue that embryos diagnosed as monosomic could be transferred, because the false <b>monosomy</b> (i.e. loss of one FISH signal in a normal dipoloid cell) is the most frequently occurring misdiagnosis. In these cases, there is no risk for an aneuploid pregnancy, and normal diploid embryos are not lost for transfer because of a FISH error. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} embryos diagnosed as monosomic on day 3 (except for chromosomes X and 21), never develop to blastocyst, which correlates with the fact that these monosomies are never observed in ongoing pregnancies.|$|E

The phenotypic variability between trisomic persons within and between families is discussed.

25|$|Diagnosis and {{misdiagnosis}} in PGD using PCR {{have been}} mathematically modelled {{in the work}} of Navidi and Arnheim and of Lewis and collaborators. The most important conclusion of these publications is that for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of an embryo, two genotypes are required. This can be based on a linked marker and disease genotypes from a single cell or on marker/disease genotypes of two cells. An interesting aspect explored in these papers is the detailed study of all possible combinations of alleles that may appear in the PCR results for a particular embryo. The authors indicate that some of the genotypes that can be obtained during diagnosis may not be concordant with the expected pattern of linked marker genotypes, but are still providing sufficient confidence about the unaffected genotype of the embryo. Although these models are reassuring, they are based on a theoretical model, and generally the diagnosis is established on a more conservative basis, aiming to avoid the possibility of misdiagnosis. When unexpected alleles appear during the analysis of a cell, depending on the genotype observed, it is considered that either an abnormal cell has been analysed or that contamination has occurred, and that no diagnosis can be established. A case in which the abnormality of the analysed cell can be clearly identified is when, using a multiplex PCR for linked markers, only the alleles of one of the parents are found in the sample. In this case, the cell can be considered as carrying a <b>monosomy</b> for the chromosome on which the markers are located, or, possibly, as haploid. The appearance of a single allele that indicates an affected genotype is considered sufficient to diagnose the embryo as affected, and embryos that have been diagnosed with a complete unaffected genotype are preferred for replacement. Although this policy may lead to a lower number of unaffected embryos suitable for transfer, it is considered preferable to the possibility of a misdiagnosis.|$|E

A correlation between phenotype and extent of deletion reveal that there is no correspondence between the size of the deletion and impairment of gonadal function.

Structural chromosome rearrangements are considered balanced when there is no apparent gain or loss of chromosome material.

An extensive intratumor heterogeneity {{in the form of}} 29 karyotypically related as well as unrelated clones was found.

40|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} {{are thought}} to be the leading cause of spontaneous abortions, accounting for approximately 50 % of clinically recognized early pregnancy losses. 1 It is estimated that a minimum of 10 - 15 % of conceptions have a chromosomal abnormality, and at least 95 % of these abnormal conceptions are lost before term. 2 Karyotype studies of miscarriages indicate that about 50 % of the chromosomal abnormalities are trisomies, 20 % are <b>monosomies</b> and 15 % are triploids.
