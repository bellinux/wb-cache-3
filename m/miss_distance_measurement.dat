3000|$|An {{experimental}} study of sensor self-localization in the free-space outdoor environment was conducted using acoustic ranging by Kwon et al. in [34]. In addressing the issue of <b>missing</b> and noisy <b>distance</b> <b>measurements,</b> a weighting function that was coupled with a soft constraint of minimum distances were introduced. The key difference in their approach is in that a gradient descent algorithm was applied {{in the process of}} minimization, and that a multiple restart scheme was used to avoid local minima. Separately, an alternative method of addressing <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> within a 3 D environment was studied by Birchfield [35], which iteratively uses a subset of points (up to 4 for 3 D) with the highest availability of <b>distance</b> <b>measurements</b> to derive an estimate of local coordinates, until all the coordinates based on relative distances are obtained.

In the fluctuating underwater environment, {{a complete set}} of pair-wise <b>distance</b> <b>measurements</b> can often be difficult to acquire, thus hindering a straightforward closed-form solution in deriving the assets' relative coordinates. An iterative multidimensional scaling approach is presented based upon a weighted-majorization algorithm that tolerates <b>missing</b> or inaccurate <b>distance</b> <b>measurements.</b> Substantial modifications are proposed to optimize the algorithm, while the effects of refractive propagation paths are considered. A parametric study of the algorithm based upon simulation results is shown.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} node localization given partial pairwise <b>distance</b> <b>measurements.</b> Current solutions first complete the <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> and then apply the classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm. Instead, we extend the classical MDS to a setup where the sensor network is composed of a fully connected group of nodes that {{communicate with each other}} (e. g., beacons), and a group of nodes that cannot communicate with each other, but each one of them communicates with each node in the first group. The positions of all nodes are unknown. We localize the fully connected nodes by exploiting their <b>distance</b> <b>measurements</b> to the disconnected nodes. At the same time, the positions of the disconnected nodes are obtained up to a translation relative to the positions of the connected nodes. Recovering this translation, can be obtained with an additional step. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms current MDS-like solutions to the problem.

A weight matrix in the formulation captures the confidence in individual dissimilarity measures, including the case of altogether <b>missing</b> <b>distances.</b> For an important class of nearness measures, the problem can be attacked with convex optimization techniques.

30|$|Each data-point of the {{simulation}} results is obtained by averaging over 10 random geometrical configurations. This {{relatively small number}} of random trials contributed to the non-smoothness in the data, but this sufficiently illustrates the trend of relationship between the parameters. Figure 3 shows the result under ideal measurement conditions, while Figure 4 shows the result where the distances are corrupted with Gaussian noise of zero mean and 5 [*]m standard deviation. Both the MDSInit and RandInit approaches are shown to have comparable minimization performance in terms of error from the actual distances, while the MDSInit approach has a lower tolerance to incomplete pairwise distances. Where the distances are corrupted by Gaussian noise (Figure 4 (a)), the error performance is dominated by the noise, demonstrating that the error performance is very similar in both approaches. The spikes in the error charts are due to a node's coordinate being resolved inaccurately, hence biasing the average error. As the missing pairwise measurements are those with the furthest distances, this occurred in the random arrangements where a single node was located much further away {{than the rest of the}} nodes, hence sharing most of the <b>missing</b> <b>distances.</b> This is verified by the results in Figure 5 obtained using ideal <b>distance</b> <b>measurements,</b> but with <b>distances</b> set to <b>missing</b> in a random manner as opposed to the largest <b>distances.</b> When <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> are set as missing in a random manner, there is a smaller probability that any one node would suffer a much higher loss of measurements, hence the higher missing pairwise tolerances in both the approaches.|$|R
