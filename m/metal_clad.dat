5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), <b>metal</b> <b>clad</b> cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A large {{attenuation}} of TM-polarized {{light has}} been observed when a thin film of Al or Cr is coated on the rib of a large cross-section SOI waveguide. While TM-polarized light is attenuated due to the motion of free electrons / plasmonic absorption in the <b>metal</b> <b>cladding,</b> TE-polarized light remains almost unaffected. Thus, we could develop an integrated optical TE-pass polarizer in SOI platform. For a <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> of length 1 mm, the TE vs TM extinction ratio of ~ 15 dB has been obtained for single-mode guiding at λ = 1550 nm. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} study {{of the effects of}} different metal claddings on the performance of terahertz quantum cascade lasers. The experimental results show that by using a <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> made of Ta/Cu/Au to replace that of Pd/Ge/Ti/Pt/Au, the maximum lasing temperature of the devices is increased from 132 to 172 K, and the threshold current density of the devices at 10 K can be reduced from 0. 74 to 0. 68 kA cm 2 ̆ 2122. The improvement of the device performance is attributed to lower optical losses associated with the <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> layers.

40|$|We analyze {{metal-clad}} disk cavities {{designed for}} nanolasers in the visible red spectrum with subwavelength device size and mode volume. <b>Metal</b> <b>cladding</b> suppresses radiation loss and supports low order modes with room temperature Q of 200 to 300. Non-degenerate single-mode operation with enhanced spontaneous emission coupling factor β is expected with the TE_(011) mode {{that has a}} 0. 46 (λ_ 0 /n) ^ 3 mode volume and Q = 210 in a device of size 0. 12 λ_ 0 ^ 3. Threshold gain calculations show that room temperature lasing is possible using multiple GaInP/AlGaInP quantum wells as the gain medium. Placing a planar metal reflector under the cavity can enhance radiation and extraction efficiencies or increase the Q, without incurring additional metallic absorption loss. We show that the far-field radiation characteristics are strongly affected by the devices’ immediate surroundings, such as changes in <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> thickness, even as the resonant mode profile, frequency, and Q remain the same. When the <b>metal</b> <b>cladding</b> is 1 µm thick, light radiates upward with a distinct intensity maximum at 45 ° when the cladding is 100 nm thick, the emitted light spreads in a near-horizontal direction...|$|R
