40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{rheological properties}} of stable and weakly aggregated two-dimensional suspensions are studied experimentally using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> interfacial rheometer. Particle monolayers with well controlled structures were prepared. Charged polystyrene particles create two-dimensional colloidal crystals at the water-decane interface {{over a wide}} range of concentrations. Under similar conditions a predominantly liquid structure is obtained at the water-air interface for the same particles. The addition of appropriate combinations of the anionic surfactant sodiumdodecylsulfate (SDS) and sodium chloride (NaCl) to the aqueous subphase leads to a destabilization of these monolayers with the formation of fractal aggregates at low concentrations and a heterogeneous gel forming as the surface coverage is increased. After the structures have been built up a reproducible structure can be obtained, of which the interfacial rheological properties can be investigated using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> stress rheometer. In all cases, numerical calculations were used to assess the importance of instrumental artifacts and the effect of the coupling between surface and subphase flows. The rheology of aggregated suspensions was compared to the reference case of a colloidal crystal. The two-dimensional aggregated suspensions display rheological features which are similar to their three-dimensional counterparts. These include an elastic response with small linearity limits, a power law dependence on surface coverage and a dependence on the strength of attraction. The results shed some light on the possible role of interfacial rheology on the stability of particle laden high interface systems. Additionally, the 2 D suspensions could present fundamental insights in the rheological properties of dense colloidal suspensions. status: publishe...|$|R

Using computer simulations we investigate the translational and rotational diffusion of dilute suspensions of magnetic nanorods with and without a (homogeneous) external magnetic field. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> are represented as spherocylinders with a longitudinal point dipole at their center and length-to-breadth ratios L/D = 3 or L/D = 9. In {{the absence of a}} field, the rods tend to form compact clusters with antiparallel ordering and thus behave very differently to dipolar spheres (L/D = 0), which tend to form head-to-tail chains. Furthermore, for rod-like particles the external field tends to destabilize rather than to support cluster formation. We show that these differences in the aggregation behavior have profound consequences not only in static material properties such as the field-induced magnetization and the zero-frequency susceptibility, but also in the dynamics. In particular, for <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> the translational diffusion constant parallel to the field is larger than the perpendicular one, in contrast to the behavior observed for magnetic spheres. Moreover, the rod-like character greatly affects the shape and the density dependence of the single-particle and collective dipole–dipole time correlation functions and their counterparts in the frequency domain...|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{colloidal}} {{materials and}} their assembly are of scientific significance and industrial importance. The development of 2 D colloidal structures {{is a key}} stepping stone towards three-dimensional (3 D) structures in relation to controlled chemical composition, morphology, assembly and so on. Nowadays, uniform colloidal structures with complexity in both shape and interactions have become a popular topic in fundamental colloid science and applications. Being motivated by this, in this thesis, micro-scale colloidal rods and self-assembled dipeptides have been studied experimentally at the air-water interface. Monolayers containing these colloidal materials were created in a Langmuir trough. Surface pressure measurements, microscopic observations and many other techniques were combined for the investigation. The aim of this work is to understand the phase behaviours in complex monolayers, including the phase transitions during compression, the flipping dynamics of micro-rods, the contribution of dipole-dipole interactions between <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods,</b> and the interfacial self-assembly process of dipeptide molecules. Iron oxide micro-rods (β-FeOOH @silica) with different aspect ratios have been synthesized to create the monolayers at an air-water interface. Microscopic observations reveal a sequence of phase transitions by compressing the monolayers. It has been proved that the aspect ratio of the rods {{plays an important role}} in the phase transitions, —short rods flip into a perpendicular position relative to the interface to relieve the compressional stress, while longer rods form multilayers under compression. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> (Fe 3 O 4) were converted from the synthesized FeOOH rods. They can be aligned in an external field, which further induces the reorganization at the interface. To study these <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods,</b> differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) was carried out to measure the magnetic moment. Their interfacial properties were investigated in an external field applied perpendicular and parallel to the interface, respectively. A magnetic field-induced flipping process has been observed, which proves the theoretical prediction. Besides rod-like particles, naphthalene dipeptides have been successfully trapped at the interface of a low pH subphase, self-assembling into a hydrogel film. The mechanism of interfacial self-assembly has been studied. Both FTIR spectra and AFM images are used to investigate the fibrous structures of the film.

The paper will demonstrate how full 3 -axis stability is achieved without the use this wheel. The pushbroom imager is still able to scan target areas accurately using a forward motion compensation method (FMC 4), simultaneously doing a roll offset manoeuvre for cross track scanning. Target tracking by pointing the high data rate S-band antenna is also successfully demonstrated, while allowing the satellite to freely rotate around the antenna boresight during these periods. The satellite has a Y-body mounted main solar panel and the attitude control system must ensure a sufficient level of solar energy collected during the sunlit part of each orbit. The control actuators employed are 3 -axis magnetic torquer rods and X/Y reaction wheels. During initial detumbling and safe mode operations, a magnetic control law is used to bring the satellite to a sun pointed Y-Thompson spinning attitude for maximum power collection. From this sun-pointed, spinning attitude an intermediate control mode is entered where the Y-reaction wheel is utilised as a momentum wheel, to absorb the body spin rate and to inertially stabilise the momentum vector initially towards the sun direction and finally aligned with the orbit normal. During this mode the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> are used to maintain the momentum vector in size and steer the pressesion direction while doing nutation damping.

Our aim is to tailor the rheological properties of fluid in¬terfaces and link them with their structure at the molecular scale. Langmuir quasi-monolayers were built by employing three different types of molecular systems, a series of semifluorinated alkanes that consist of two hydrophobic segments, a homopolymer, Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and block copolymers of PEO-PDMS with differ¬ent molecular architectures. The techniques employed in this thesis include Langmuir-Pockels trough, to measure surface pressure/ area isotherms, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> in-terfacial stress rheometer, double wall ring fixture and bi-conical device in commercial rheometers for interfacial rheology studies. For structural studies of the films at the air-water interface we performed neutron reflectivity measurements and scanning force microscopy. We observed great tunability of the structural and rheological properties of the semifluorinated alkanes moving from simple linear molecules to more complex and branched architectures, showing that molecular modification can change dramatically the viscoelastic response of the layers. Regardless of the molecular architecture effect, the external light stimulus effect was investigated for photo-sensitive semifluorinated alkanes that could change their conformation reversibly from trans to cis. One of the main {{findings of this study}} was the transition from ordered to mixed (disordered) struc¬tures whose onset is signaled by the drop of the interfacial storage modulus of about one order of magnitude. The predominantly elastic layers of PMMA were used to investigate the presence of even harmonics among different rheometry techniques. By analysing the strain signal in the Fourier space, {{it was found that the}} bi-conical and the double wall ring fixture do not generate even harmonics while the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> showed the presence of 2 nd harmonics that are connected with asymmetry in the stress-strain profile, apparently stemming from ununiformity in flow and the subphase contribution.
