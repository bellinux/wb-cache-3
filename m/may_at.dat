5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player <b>may</b> <b>at</b> any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E

He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's Rasping, who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from Rasping, with Hornby in third and Whiff last of the four runners.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it <b>may</b> <b>at</b> times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
