5|$|In late March, West Nohno {{began the}} first of three Boston–Liverpool round trips. On the Halifax–Liverpool leg of this first trip, she had some {{unspecified}} problem that required her return to Halifax, but {{it must have been a}} minor problem since she sailed again for Liverpool a week later.

5|$|Kentuckian resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, {{which resulted in the}} delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.|$|E
60|$|He {{talked for}} an hour with the girl, gave her {{explicit}} instructions, thrust some money into her hand, and then drove {{her back to the}} bend in the path whence she quickly <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> up <b>to</b> the great house.|$|R
60|$|Trot wasn't sure, either, {{when she}} thought of it in that light. After awhile she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the sands again, and Cap'n Bill {{followed}} her. As they sat down, the child looked thoughtfully at the sailor's bulging pockets.|$|R
50|$|Redesignated AK-276 (7 May 1956), Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton carried {{supplies}} to northern bases in Greenland in July and in August; and, in September, she sailed for northern Europe, whence she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the Pacific via the Suez Canal.|$|R
5|$|West Nohno had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, {{when she}} sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks {{to clean it}} while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered the tank and removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did not. For his efforts, Vaagsnes received {{a pair of binoculars}} from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|With her {{reconditioning}} complete, West Cheswald {{arrived in}} New York from Baltimore on 23 March. Although {{she may have}} been scheduled to begin her African service as early as 29 March, she sailed from New York on 11 April for the Cape Verde Islands, and from there, to Cape Town, where she arrived on 15 May. Beginning the next day, West Cheswald visited Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Mombasa, Tanga, and Zanzibar through 11 June. She returned to Tanga, then sailed from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar and back on 23 and 24 June. She next <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Lourenço Marques, where she arrived on 3 July. From Lourenço Marques, she sailed back to Durban and Cape Town, before she began her transatlantic journey to Trinidad on 18 July. After calling at that Caribbean port, she returned to New York to complete her first circuit on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the village}} of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken {{to one of the}} bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run {{from the top of the}} masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
