40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how inside and outside directors differ in their cognition and reasoning in regards to environmental sustainability issues. The theoretical background derives from a cognitive view and Stakeholder theory. The paper is further based on current research regarding insiders’ and outsiders’ relationship to environmental sustainability. In order to capture the cognition and reasoning of insiders and outsiders, a Think-aloud study was conducted, interviewing a total of 20 board members in the food industry. Results from this study showed that, when faced with environmental issues, outsiders are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> request, repeat, ponder as well as clarify the information given. Secondly, outsiders are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider a long-term perspective. Thirdly, outsiders are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider an environmental view. Lastly, both insiders and outsiders use analogical reasoning when contemplating around environmental issues. However, insiders are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>experience</b> from their current position or company while outsiders are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>experience</b> from outside their current position or company when solving environmental issues...|$|R

5000|$|Assuming that {{determination}} {{is influenced by}} the emotion of challenge and the expectations placed on an individual by their social context, determination is fostered in educational, occupational and familial environments that encourage men and women. If an individual is provided resources and surrounded by people who believe they are capable of goal achievement, said individual is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experienced</b> increases in determination and subsequent improvement in performance and well-being. For example, research has shown that students enrolled in positive learning environments where teachers incorporate strategies meant to meet students' motivational needs (i.e., encouragement aimed at intrinsic rewards, using student-directed forms of discipline) are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become responsible learners who display a determination to succeed. In the essay [...] "College Pressures" [...] by William Zinsser, the pressures faced by college students at Yale are studied. The pressures include the need to develop time management and study skills appropriate for college work, the desire for good grades, the desire to meet parents' expectations, and the need to find employment in a competitive job market after graduation.|$|R
25|$|About 100million {{bacteria}} must typically be ingested {{to cause}} cholera {{in a normal}} healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having {{the highest rates of}} infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or children who are malnourished, are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Predictors of poor {{mental health}} after a trauma, such as mental health status {{prior to a}} trauma and {{individual}} characteristics, can help determine those who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior to an earthquake will be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> negative life changes than positive life changes with regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can predict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior to the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and low self-control {{are associated with a}} lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake, however optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A major {{motive for}} lynchings, {{particularly}} in the South, was the white society's efforts to maintain white supremacy after emancipation of slaves following the American Civil War; they punished perceived violations of customs, later institutionalized as Jim Crow laws, which mandated racial segregation of whites and blacks, and second-class status for blacks. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that more racially segregated counties were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> lynchings. Economic competition was another major factor; independent black farmers or businessmen were sometimes lynched or suffered destruction of their property. In the Deep South, the number of lynchings was higher in areas with a concentration of blacks in an area (such as a county), dependent on cotton {{and at a time}} of low cotton prices, rising inflation, a predominance of Democrats, and competition among religious groups.|$|E

25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they may be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration {{have been shown to}} be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{immunity}} {{can also}} be gained passively, in which antibodies to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily immunoglobulin G antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns, or artificially, by which antibodies from the serum or plasma of an immune individual are injected into a susceptible person. Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate but wanes {{over the course of}} weeks to months, so any contribution to herd immunity is temporary. For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns, such as influenza and tetanus, pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child. In the same way, high-risk groups that are either <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> infection or are more likely to develop complications from infection may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms.|$|E

40|$|The {{inability}} to reach orgasm {{is probably the}} least common and least understood of all male sexual dysfunctions. The present study aims to investigate the incidence of the {{inability to}} reach orgasm, and the psychological and interpersonal factors associated with this sexual difficulty. A total of 3, 672 heterosexual men from three European countries (1, 937 Portuguese, 1, 215 Croats, 520 Norwegians) participated in this web survey (M age = 36. 6  years, SD = 18 - 75  years). A total of 354 (9. 6 %) reported the inability to reach orgasm. Among those men, 89. 8 % reported moderate to extreme distress regarding this sexual difficulty. A multivariate assessment revealed that men in short-term relationships and taking antidepressants were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report inability to reach orgasm. Men who reported having difficulties getting or maintaining an erection were 4  times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>experienced</b> the inability <b>to</b> reach orgasm than were {{those who did not}} report this difficulty. Men who experienced difficulty "'letting go' and surrendering to sexual pleasure during sex" were 2. 7  times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>experienced</b> the inability <b>to</b> reach orgasm than were those who did not report this difficulty. This difficulty of "letting go" might reflect the unwillingness to give oneself, an idea presented in previous research...|$|R

25|$|Māori suffer more health problems, {{including}} {{higher levels}} of alcohol and drug abuse, smoking and obesity. Less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to {{higher levels of}} morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions, such as cervical cancer, diabetes per head of population than non-Māori. Although Māori life expectancy rates have increased dramatically in the last 50 years, they still have considerably lower life-expectancies compared to New Zealanders of European ancestry: in 2004, Māori males lived 69.0 years vs. non-Māori males 77.2 years; Māori females 73.2 yrs vs. non-Māori females 81.9 years. This gap had narrowed by 2013: 72.8 years for men and 76.5 years for women, compared to 80.2 years for non-Māori men and 83.7 years for non-Māori women.

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
500|$|The {{co-occurrence of}} major {{depressive}} disorder and alcoholism is well documented. Among those with comorbid occurrences, a distinction is commonly made between depressive episodes that remit with alcohol abstinence ("substance-induced"), and depressive episodes that are primary and do not remit with abstinence ("independent" [...] episodes). Additional use of other drugs may {{increase the risk of}} depression. Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or borderline personality disorder. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulse disorders or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Women with alcoholism are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> physical or sexual assault, abuse and domestic violence than women in the general population, which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.|$|E

It investigates whether female-headed households are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>experiencing</b> a food price shock, and whether female-headed households experiencing a shock are <b>more</b> (or less) <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> adopt certain coping strategies, controlling for individual, household, and community characteristics. Our findings suggest that female-headed households are more vulnerable to food price changes and are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>experienced</b> a food price shock in 2007 – 08. Because female-headed households are also resource poor and have a larger food gap compared with male-headed households, they cope by cutting back on the number of meals they provide their households during good months and eating less preferred foods in general. Our findings that land—particularly better quality land—has a protective effect against food price shocks also highlight the role of strengthening land rights of the poor, particularly poor women, to enable them to cope better with food price increases. coping mechanisms, food price crisis, Gender,...|$|R
