In search of genes that are involved in the regulation of hepA, we transposon <b>mutagenized</b> <b>strain</b> DR 1069, which bears a chromosomal hepA::luxAB fusion. One resulting mutant, designated HNL 3, grows normally in medium with nitrate and shows poor induction of hepA in response to nitrogen deprivation. In HNL 3, transposon Tn 5 - 1058 is inserted within gene hcwA, a constitutively expressed open reading frame whose predicted product resembles N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases. Reconstruction of the mutation confirmed that the mutant phenotype resulted from the insertion of the transposon. The induction of hepA in HNL 3 is partially restored upon recombination of HNL 3 with plasmid-borne, wild-type hcwA. Moreover, HcwA expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits wall-lytic activity. These results suggest that the degradation, or possibly reconstruction, of the cell peptidoglycan layer is a prerequisite for heterocyst maturation...|$|E

Since these single-strand breaks can be detected by both alkaline sucrose and neutral formamide-sucrose gradient sedimentation, we concluded that the single-strand breaks observed in UV-irradiated uvrC cells are due to phosphodiester bond interruptions in DNA and are not due to apurinic/apyrimidinic sites...|$|R

Reversions or additional mutations were not detected in the U 3 and R regions of proviral DNA from CEMxl 74 cells infected with the SIVmac 239 mutants. Similar results were obtained when mutants of SIVmacMER (a macrophage-competent derivative of SIVmac 239) were tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cell and CEMx 174 cultures. However, the growth of most mutated viruses was suppressed in primary rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages (SIVmacMER approximately 2 xNFkappaB approximately substNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl 234 approximately deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl > deltaSpl 234 approximately substSpl 2 > substSp 23 approximately substSp 34 approximately substSpl 234 > or = SIVmac 239). Thus, changes in the Sp 1 binding sites had the most dramatic effects on SIVmac replication in primary macrophage cultures.

This region is responsive to transactivation by Tat. In addition, the SIV TATA box was shown to be stronger than that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

Neither the protein F-deficient mutant nor its revertants had gross surface alterations as judged by their sensitivities to 31 phages with diverse receptors and their low degrees of leakage of periplasmic beta-lactamase into the supernatant. Outer membrane permeability was measured in whole cells by examining the rates of hydrolysis of a chromogenic beta-lactam, nitrocefin, by periplasmic RP 1 -encoded beta-lactamase. It was found that the outer membrane permeabilities of wild-type and protein F revertant strains were similar, but low when compared with those of Escherichia coli and an antibiotic-supersusceptible mutant Z 61 of P. aeruginosa.

In this strategy, a mutant retrieved from a genetic screen is crossed with a polymorphic C. elegans strain, individual F 2 progeny from this cross is selected for the mutant phenotype, the progeny of these F 2 animals are pooled and then whole-genome-sequenced.

40|$|Polyketides are a {{group of}} {{bioactive}} natural products synthesized by bacteria, fungi and plants with various acyl-CoA precursors, such as malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA. A sufficient supply of these precursors {{is a prerequisite for}} the high level production of polyketide products. A thorough understanding of relative roles of various metabolic pathways involved in precursor supply makes increased production by genetical manipulation, and thus rational strain improvement, a reality. Monensin A is a polyketide antibiotic assembled from one ethylmalonyl-CoA, seven methylmalonyl-CoA and five malonyl-CoA molecules by Streptomyces cinnamonensis. In the present work, the origin of these biosynthetic precursors was investigated using an industrially mutagenized monensin producer and industrial fermentation conditions. A hitherto disregarded metabolic pathway was discovered to {{play a significant role in}} providing methylmalonyl-CoA for monensin biosynthesis by gene disruption, isotope-labeling of monensin and analysis of in vivo acyl-CoA pools. This pathway starts from biosynthesis of butyryl-CoA from two molecules of acetyl-CoA, and goes through the intermediate of isobutyryl-CoA, and finally produces methylmalonyl-CoA by direct oxidation of the pro-S methyl group of isobutyryl-CoA. Industrial fermentation of the industrially mutagenized monensin producer yields significantly more monensin than the routine laboratory fermentation. This suggested the presence of abundant in vivo malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA in this process and presented an opportunity to utilize it as a biological system for the high-titer production of heterologous polyketides derived from malonyl-CoA and/or methylmalonyl-CoA. The tetracenomycin C polyketide synthase (PKS) synthesizes tetracenomycin C, a polyketide with ten molecules of malonyl-CoA. In this work, the tetracenomycin C PKS gene cluster was introduced into two industrially <b>mutagenized</b> <b>strains</b> of Streptomyces cinnamonensis. Unprecedented multi-gram/liter of tetracenomycin production was observed in the resulting two strains, indicating the high potential of industrially <b>mutagenized</b> monensin production <b>strains</b> as efficient hosts for the production of malonyl-CoA-derived polyketides. For additional improvement in tetracenomycin yield, we attempted to increase malonyl-CoA supply to tetracenomycin C PKS by genetically manipulating metabolic pathways affecting production of malonyl-CoA and eliminating competition from monensin PKS for malonyl-CoA. However, only decreased tetracenomycin production was observed, demonstrating that the regulation of malonyl-CoA-related metabolic pathways is a complex process...|$|R

Strain RG 99, which carries both the cyd- and cyo- alleles, grows normally under anaerobic conditions {{in the presence of}} nitrate. Introduction of the cyd+ allele into the strain restores the respiration function of the strain, indicating that the cytochrome o branch of the respiratory chain is dispensable under normal laboratory growth conditions...|$|R
40|$|Of seven chloramphenicol-producing {{actinomycetes}} examined, only Streptomyces venezuelae strain 13 s contained extrachromosomal DNA detectable by agarose {{gel electrophoresis}} and cesium chloride-ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation. The single 17 -megadalton plasmid present in this strain was indistinguishable from plasmid pUC 3 previously isolated from <b>mutagenized</b> cultures. <b>Strains</b> selected for their inability to produce chloramphenicol after treatment with acriflavine or ethidium bromide still contained a plasmid that had the same electrophoretic mobility as plasmid pUC 3 and yielded similar fragments when digested with restriction endonucleases. By regenerating protoplasts of strain 13 s and screening for isolates lacking extrachromosomal DNA, strain PC 51 - 5 was obtained. The absence of plasmid pUC 3 sequences in this strain was confirmed by Southern hybridization using 32 P-labeled plasmid as a probe. Since the plasmidless strain produced as much chloramphenicol as did the parent strain, pUC 3 contains neither structural nor regulatory genes for antibiotic production. Evidence from electrophoretic analysis of BamHI digests of total cellular DNA from wild-type and dye-treated nonproducing progeny indicated that acriflavine caused structural changes in the chromosome...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutophagy in {{the yeast}} {{is similar to}} that in {{mammalian}} cells. A mutant designated as apg 1 (autophagy) defective in accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was isolated by selection using a light microscope from a <b>mutagenized</b> proteinase-deficient <b>strain.</b> In the apg 1 strain, which has normal vacuolar proteinases, nitrogen starvation did not induce protein degradation. The apg 1 mutant lost its viability faster than wild-type cells during nitrogen starvation. By using the loss of viability as a first screening test, 75 other apg mutants were selected. These apg mutants including apg 1 fell into 15 complementation groups. Genetic analyses of representative apg mutants revealed that they all had single recessive chromosomal mutations. Strains with each apg mutation were defective in protein degradation in the vacuoles induced by nitrogen starvation and homozygous diploids for each apg mutation did not sporulate. These results on the apg mutants suggest that autophagy via autophagic bodies is indispensable for protein degradation in the vacuoles under starvation conditions, and that at least 15 APG genes are involved in autophagy in yeast...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a decade}} ago, the last {{mutagenesis}} to generate mutations affecting associative learning in Drosophila ended. In all, about 3500 <b>strains,</b> <b>mutagenized</b> with ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), were screened first in S. Benzer's laboratory at CalTech {{and then in}} W. G. Quinn's laboratory at Princeton (for eview, see Aceves-Pina et al. 1983). Associative learning was as-sayed with an olfactory shock-avoidance conditioning procedure specifically designed to produce an average learning index for a population of flies, which were trained and tested en masse (Quinn et al. 1974). The conditioning procedure employed two conditioned stimuli (CSs) : Flies received electric shock (US) if they approached one odor (CS+), but not if they ap-proached a second odor (CS-). In a subsequent tes...|$|R
40|$|Three polynucleotide {{phosphorylase}} mutations, {{isolated in}} heavily <b>mutagenized</b> Escherichia coli <b>strains</b> Q 7, Q 13, and Q 27, were characterized after their transfer by P 1 transduction to nearly isogenic strains which lack ribonuclease I. Each strain {{has a different}} altered form of polynucleotide phosphorylase. One enzyme exhibited sharply reduced activity under all conditions tested. A second had reduced activity which was stimulated by Mn++. The third enzyme was thermolabile and could be > 95 % inactivated in vivo at 44 C and pH 6 if the cells were prevented from growing; during growth under these and other conditions, the full enzyme level was maintained. The strains showed no differences from the wild type in their growth rates, their adjustments to changes in media and temperature, or their recoveries from starvation...|$|R
40|$|Antimycotic-producing {{strains of}} Pseudomonas syringae are being tested as Dutch elm disease control agents. We {{examined}} {{the role of}} antimycotic production in disease control. Transposon Tn 903 was used to <b>mutagenize</b> the antimycotic-producing <b>strain</b> MSU 174. Eighty-one mutants that did not inhibit fungal growth were identified among 15, 000 Tn 903 -containing derivatives. Linkages between Tn 903 insertions and defects in antimycotic metabolism were established. Three Tn 903 -containing strains (two antimycotic producers and one nonproducer) were individually introduced into American elm seedlings. The seedlings were subsequently challenged with Ceratocystis ulmi, the causal agent of Dutch elm disease. Protection of the elms was observed with the two antimycotic-producing strains {{but not with the}} nonproducing strain. The introduced strains could be readily recovered from the seedlings after two growing seasons. They were unequivocally identified by the Tn 903 insertions they contain...|$|R
40|$|The {{suicide plasmid}} pfdA 31 −Tn 5 was {{constructed}} to mutagenize Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli strains by electorporation. This vector carries the bacteriophage fd replication origin, a beta−lactamase gene and the transposon Tn 5. For propagation the plasmid depends on host cells producing fd gene− 2 protein. Electroporation of E. amylovora or E. coli cells with plasmid pfdA 31 −Tn 5 yielded more than 10 (4) transposition events per micrograms DNA. We have produced and characterized transposon mutants of E. amylovora affecting either galactose metabolism or {{the synthesis of}} the phytotoxin (L) − 2, 5 −dihydrophenylalanine. A Tn 5 −insertion in a gene, involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis of E. amylovora strain Ea 7 / 74, was subcloned into vector pfdA 31 and used to <b>mutagenize</b> E. amylovora <b>strain</b> Ea 1 / 79 by site−directed recombinatio...|$|R
40|$|A new {{insertion}} element of 1, 449 bp with 25 -bp perfect terminal repeats, designated IS 1409, was {{identified in the}} chromosome of 4 -chlorobenzoate-degrading Arthrobacter sp. strain TM 1 NCIB 12013. Upon insertion, IS 1409 causes a target duplication of 8 bp. IS 1409 carries only a single open reading frame of 435 codons encoding the transposase TnpA. Both TnpA and the overall organization of IS 1409 are highly {{similar to those of}} some related {{insertion element}}s of the ISL 3 group (J. Mahillon and M. Chandler, Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 62 : 725 – 774, 1998). IS 1409 was also found in other 4 -chlorobenzoate-degrading Arthrobacter strains and Micrococcus luteus. Based on IS 1409, a series of transposons carrying resistance genes for chloramphenicol and gentamicin were constructed. These transposons were used to demonstrate transposition events in vivo and to <b>mutagenize</b> Arthrobacter sp. <b>strains...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (A 4. 85) which reacted with Fe-regulated proteins of Neisseria meningitidis, {{was used to}} isolate a lambda gt 11 clone from N. meningitidis FAM 20. Chromosomal fragments flanking the fragment expressing the A 4. 85 epitope were cloned, and their DNA sequences revealed a 3, 345 -bp open reading frame predicting a 122 -kDa protein. This gene was named frpA (Fe-regulated protein). A computer similarity search of GenBank revealed high levels of similarity {{to members of the}} RTX family of cytotoxins, especially in a region of tandem 9 -amino-acid repeats. These repeats are found in all members of the RTX family; similar repeats were present 13 times in the predicted FrpA protein. Antigenic relatedness between the meningococcal proteins and the RTX proteins was demonstrated by the reactivity of A 4. 85 with Escherichia coli hemolysin (HlyA) and Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (CyaA). Similarly, FrpA was recognized by 9 D 4, a {{monoclonal antibody}} directed against B. pertussis CyaA. In addition to the frpA gene, a second gene (frpC) produced a larger RTX-related protein. The frpA and frpC loci were <b>mutagenized</b> in <b>strain</b> FAM 20, resulting in the loss of RTX-related proteins. A 120 -kDa protein was expressed from the reconstructed frpA gene in E. coli. The biological function of FrpA is unknown, but its similarity to other RTX toxins suggests that it may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of meningococcal infection...|$|R
