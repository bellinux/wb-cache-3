Tow truck drivers claimed that the program hurt their business and nine wrecker companies filed lawsuits against the city. White testified in court in the case. In addition the SafeClear Program has been blamed for causing the deaths of people, who seemed to be trying to get their cars off the freeway without having to pay fees to the tow truck drivers. The cause of death of these people, however, is uncertain. State Senator John Whitmire recruited 30 out of 31 Texas State Senators' votes to make the SafeClear program illegal. White responded to the controversy and criticism by changing the rules of the program and the towing laws, including free towing for limited distances funded by the city. The program was adapted to include strict licensing of SafeClear wreckers including criminal background checks, allowing the towed motorist to be towed for one mile for free, preventing the City leasing stretches of state-owned highway to private wrecker companies, and requiring revenue generated from the program to enter a <b>mobility</b> <b>fund.</b> White also worked with John Whitmire to address the objections of the senators, keeping the program alive but in a different format. He also rode with a wrecker and conducted several studies of the program. Despite the controversy, independent studies have found that the program has helped. Studies show that the program has been successful in decreasing accidents. A study, conducted by Rice University and Texas A University found that the number of freeway crashes decreased by 10.4%, [...] or nearly 2,000 crashes. According to these results, drivers in Houston saved approximately $35 million by the implementation of the program. However Suzanne Poole, president of the Houston Professional Towing Association, says those numbers are misleading and actual crashes are actually higher. In reference to the program's objective to decrease traffic congestion, a study by KHOU-TV found that average drive times increased at 86% of freeways into Houston six months after the program was implemented compared to before the program. However, some claim that more cars were on the roads during these six months and that construction on the freeways, particularly on US 59, caused drive times to increase. Nonetheless, SafeClear remained one of the most controversial, and one of few controversies, during his time as mayor.|$|E

MethodsCross-sectional analyses were conducted using marital violence data collected during the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys from Bangladesh (n= 3665), India (n= 56357), and Nepal (n= 3037). Data were pooled to assess associations of marital violence (physical or sexual) with modern contraception use (current spacing or sterilization). ResultsSexual marital violence was associated with both modern spacing contraception (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1. 30; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 13 – 1. 49) and sterilization (AOR 0. 79; 95 % CI, 0. 70 – 0. 88). Sexual violence was reported more often by pill users (9. 8 % vs 5. 5 % for non-users) but less often by condom users (4. 5 % vs 5. 8 % for non-users).

One way to pay for this would be to transfer $15.5 billion to a Connect America Fund for areas not adequately served. This money would come from the Universal Service Fund created for telephone service for individuals and Internet access for schools and libraries. In addition, a <b>Mobility</b> <b>Fund</b> would provide funds for states to offer their own broadband programs.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{position}} of the thiazole orange derivative in triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) is varied and the fluorescence of the resulting complexes with DNA duplexes, single-stranded DNAs and RNAs are evaluated. Under similar conditions single attachment of the TO-dye to 2 '-O-propargyl nucleotides in the TFOs (assembly dependent fluorescence enhancing nucleic acids, AFENA) led to probes with low fluorescent intensity in the single-stranded state with fluorescence quantum yield (FF) of 0. 9 %- 1. 5 %. Significant increase in fluorescence intensity was detected after formation of DNA triplexes (FF= 23. 5 %- 34. 9 %). Under similar conditions, Watson- Crick-type duplexes formed by the probes with single stranded (ss) RNA and ssDNA showed lower fluorescence intensities. Bugle insertions of twisted intercalating nucleic acid (TINA) monomers were shown to improve the fluorescent characteristics of GT/GA-containing antiparallel AFENA-TFOs. Self-aggregation of TFOs caused by guanosines was eliminated by TINA insertion which also promoted DNA triplex formation at pH 7. 2. Importantly these AFENA-TINA-TFOs can bind to the duplex in the presence of complementary RNA at 37 8 C. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|A {{computational}} predictive {{tool for}} assessing patient-specific corneal tissue properties is developed. This predictive tool considers as input variables the corneal central thickness (CCT), the intraocular pressure (IOP), and the maximum deformation amplitude of the corneal apex (U) when {{subjected to a}} non-contact tonometry test. The proposed methodology consists of two main steps. First, an extensive dataset is generated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations based on finite element models with patient-specific geometric features that simulate the non-contact tonometry test. The cornea {{is assumed to be}} an anisotropic tissue to reproduce the experimentally observed mechanical behavior. A clinical database of 130 patients (53 healthy, 63 keratoconic and 14 post-LASIK surgery) is used to generate a dataset of more than 9000 cases by permuting the material properties. The second step consists of constructing predictive models for the material parameters of the constitutive model {{as a function of the}} input variables. Four different approximations are explored: quadratic response surface (QRS) approximation, multiple layer perceptron (MLP), support vector regressor (SVR), and K-nn search. The models are validated against data from five real patients. The material properties obtained with the predicted models lead to a simulated corneal displacement that is within 10 % error of the measured value in the worst case scenario of a patient with very advanced keratoconus disease. These results demonstrate the potential and soundness of the proposed methodology.

40|$|ArticleSocial-ecological {{systems are}} often highly complex, making {{effective}} governance a considerable challenge. In large, heterogeneous systems, hierarchical institutional regimes may be efficient, but effective management outcomes {{are dependent on}} stakeholder support. This support is shaped by perceptions of legitimacy, which risks being undermined where resource users are not engaged in decision-making. Although legitimacy is demonstrably critical for effective governance, less {{is known about the}} factors contributing to stakeholders’ perceptions of legitimacy or how these perceptions are socially differentiated. We quantitatively assessed stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy (indicated by support for rules) and their contributory factors among 307 commercial fishers and tourism operators in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Legitimacy was most strongly associated with trust in information from governing bodies, followed by confidence in institutional performance and the equity of management outcomes. Legitimacy differed both within and among resource user groups, which emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of commonly defined stakeholder groups. Overall, tourism operators perceived higher legitimacy than did commercial fishers, which was associated with higher trust in information from management agencies. For fishers, higher levels of trust were associated with: (1) engagement in fisheries that had high subsector cohesion and positive previous experiences of interactions with governing bodies; (2) location in areas with greater proximity to sources of knowledge, resources, and decision-making; and (3) engagement in a Reef Guardian program. These findings highlight the necessity of strategies and processes to build trust among all user groups in large social-ecological systems such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Furthermore, the social differentiation of perceptions that were observed within user groups underscores the importance of targeted strategies to engage groups that may not be heard through traditional governance channels.

Highly motile human spermatozoa, were exposed for one hour to 900 MHz mobile phone radiation at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2. 0 W/kg and examined at various times after exposure. The acrosome reaction was evaluated using flow cytometry. The radiation did not affect sperm propensity for the acrosome reaction. Morphometric parameters were assessed by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Significant reduction in sperm head area (9. 2 ± 0. 7 μm 2 vs. 18. 8 ± 1. 4 μm 2) and acrosome percentage of the head area (21. 5 ± 4 % vs. 35. 5 ± 11. 4 %) were reported among exposed sperm compared with unexposed controls.

40|$|Broadband {{networks}} only {{create value}} to {{consumers and businesses}} when they are {{used in conjunction with}} broadband-capable devices to deliver useful applications and content. The plan seeks to ensure that the entire broadband ecosystem - networks, devices, content and applications - is healthy.   Executive Summary Broadband is the great infrastructure challenge of the early 21 st century. Like electricity a century ago, broadband is a foundation for economic growth, job creation, global competitiveness and a better way of life. It is enabling entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for existing ones. It is changing how we educate children, deliver health care, manage energy, ensure public safety, engage government, and access, organize and disseminate knowledge. Fueled primarily by private sector investment and innovation, the American broadband ecosystem has evolved rapidly. The number of Americans who have broadband at home has grown from eight million in 2000 to nearly 200 million last year. Increasingly capable fixed and mobile networks allow Americans to access a growing number of valuable applications through innovative devices. But broadband in America is not all it needs to be. Approximately 100 million Americans do not have broadband at home. Broadband-enabled health information technology (IT) can improve care and lower costs by {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} in the coming decades, yet the United States is behind many advanced countries in the adoption of such technology. Broadband can provide teachers with tools that allow students to learn the same course material in half the time, but there is a dearth of easily accessible digital educational content required for such opportunities. A broadband-enabled Smart Grid could increase energy independence and efficiency, but much of the data required to capture these benefits are inaccessible to consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. And nearly a decade after 9 / 11, our first responders still lack a nationwide public safety mobile broadband communications network, even though such a network could improve emergency response and homeland security. Fulfilling the Congressional Mandate In early 2009, Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop a National Broadband Plan to ensure every American has “access to broadband capability. ” Congress also required that this plan include a detailed strategy for achieving affordability and maximizing use of broadband to advance “consumer welfare, civic participation, public safety and homeland security, community development, health care delivery, energy independence and efficiency, education, employee training, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activity, job creation and economic growth, and other national purposes. ” Broadband networks only create value to consumers and businesses when they are used in conjunction with broadband-capable devices to deliver useful applications and content. To fulfill Congress’s mandate, the plan seeks to ensure that the entire broadband ecosystem—networks, devices, content and applications— is healthy. It makes recommendations to the FCC, the Executive Branch, Congress and state and local governments. The Plan Government can influence the broadband ecosystem in four ways: 	Design policies to ensure robust competition and, as a result maximize consumer welfare, innovation and investment. 	Ensure efficient allocation and management of assets government controls or influences, such as spectrum, poles, and rights-of-way, to encourage network upgrades and competitive entry. 	Reform current universal service mechanisms to support deployment of broadband and voice in high-cost areas; and ensure that low-income Americans can afford broadband; and in addition, support efforts to boost adoption and utilization. 	Reform laws, policies, standards and incentives to maximize the benefits of broadband in sectors government influences significantly, such as public education, health care and government operations. 1. Establishing competition policies. Policymakers, including the FCC, have a broad set of tools to protect and encourage competition in the markets that make up the broadband ecosystem: network services, devices, applications and content. The plan contains multiple recommendations that will foster competition across the ecosystem. They include the following: 	Collect, analyze, benchmark and publish detailed, market-by-market information on broadband pricing and competition, which will likely have direct impact on competitive behavior (e. g., through benchmarking of pricing across geographic markets). This will also enable the FCC and other agencies to apply appropriate remedies when competition is lacking in specific geographies or market segments. 	Develop disclosure requirements for broadband service providers to ensure consumers have the pricing and performance information they need to choose the best broadband offers in the market. Increased transparency will incent service providers to compete for customers on the basis of actual performance. 	Undertake a comprehensive review of wholesale competition rules to help ensure competition in fixed and mobile broadband services. 	Free up and allocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use, fostering ongoing innovation and competitive entry. 	Update rules for wireless backhaul spectrum to increase capacity in urban areas and range in rural areas. 	Expedite action on data roaming to determine how best to achieve wide, seamless and competitive coverage, encourage mobile broadband providers to construct and build networks, and promote entry and competition. 	Change rules to ensure a competitive and innovative video set-top box market, to be consistent with Section 629 of the Telecommunications Act. The Act says that the FCC should ensure that its rules achieve a competitive market in video “navigation devices,” or set-top boxes—the devices consumers use to access much of the video they watch today. 	Clarify the Congressional mandate allowing state and local entities to provide broadband in their communities and do so in ways that use public resources more effectively. 	Clarify the relationship between users and their online profiles to enable continued innovation and competition in applications and ensure consumer privacy, including the obligations of firms collecting personal information to allow consumers to know what information is being collected, consent to such collection, correct it if necessary, and control disclosure of such personal information to third parties. 2. Ensuring efficient allocation and use of government-owned and government-influenced assets. Government establishes policies for the use of spectrum and oversees access to poles, conduits, rooftops and rights-of-way, which are used in the deployment of broadband networks. Government also finances a large number of infrastructure projects. Ensuring these assets and resources are allocated and managed efficiently can encourage deployment of broadband infrastructure and lower barriers to competitive entry. The plan contains a number of recommendations to accomplish these goals. They include the following: 	Spectrum is a major input for providers of broadband service. Currently, the FCC has only 50 megahertz in inventory, just a fraction of the amount that will be necessary to match growing demand. More efficient allocation and assignment of spectrum will reduce deployment costs, drive investment and benefit consumers through better performance and lower prices. The recommendations on spectrum policy include the following: 	 		Make 500 megahertz of spectrum newly available for broadband within 10 years, of which 300 megahertz should be made available for mobile use within five years. 		Enable incentives and mechanisms to repurpose spectrum to more flexible uses. Mechanisms include incentive auctions, which allow auction proceeds to be shared in an equitable manner with current licensees as market demands change. These would benefit both spectrum holders and the American public. The public could benefit from additional spectrum for high-demand uses and from new auction revenues. Incumbents, meanwhile, could recognize a portion of the value of enabling new uses of spectrum. For example, this would allow the FCC to share auction proceeds with broadcasters who voluntarily agree to use technology to continue traditional broadcast services with less spectrum. 		Ensure greater transparency of spectrum allocation, assignment and use through an FCC-created spectrum dashboard to foster an efficient secondary market. 		Expand opportunities for innovative spectrum access models by creating new avenues for opportunistic and unlicensed use of spectrum and increasing research into new spectrum technologies. 	 	 	Infrastructure such as poles, conduits, rooftops and rights-of-way play an important role in the economics of broadband networks. Ensuring service providers can access these resources efficiently and at fair prices can drive upgrades and facilitate competitive entry. In addition, testbeds can drive innovation of next-generation applications and, ultimately, may promote infrastructure deployment. Recommendations to optimize infrastructure use include: 	 		Establish low and more uniform rental rates for access to poles, and simplify and expedite the process for service providers to attach facilities to poles. 		Improve rights-of-way management for cost and time savings, promote use of federal facilities for broadband, expedite resolution of disputes and identify and establish “best practices” guidelines for rights-of-way policies and fee practices that are consistent with broadband deployment. 		Facilitate efficient new infrastructure construction, including through “dig-once” policies that would make federal financing of highway, road and bridge projects contingent on states and localities allowing joint deployment of broadband infrastructure. 		Provide ultra-high-speed broadband connectivity to select U. S. Department of Defense installations to enable the development of next-generation broadband applications for military personnel and their families living on base. 	 	 3. Creating incentives for universal availability and adoption of broadband. Three elements must be in place to ensure all Americans have the opportunity to reap the benefits of broadband. All Americans should have access to broadband service with sufficient capabilities, all should be able to afford broadband and all should have the opportunity to develop digital literacy skills to take advantage of broadband. Recommendations to promote universal broadband deployment and adoption include the following: 	Ensure universal access to broadband network services. 	 		Create the Connect America Fund (CAF) to support the provision of affordable broadband and voice with at least 4 Mbps actual download speeds and shift up to $ 15. 5 billion over the next decade from the existing Universal Service Fund (USF) program to support broadband. If Congress wishes to accelerate the deployment of broadband to unserved areas and otherwise smooth the transition of the Fund, it could make available public funds of a few billion dollars per year over two to three years. 		Create a <b>Mobility</b> <b>Fund</b> to provide targeted funding to ensure no states are lagging significantly behind the national average for 3 G wireless coverage. Such 3 G coverage is widely expected to be the basis for the future footprint of 4 G mobile broadband networks. 		Transition the “legacy” High-Cost component of the USF over the next 10 years and shift all resources to the new funds. The $ 4. 6 billion per year High Cost component of the USF was designed to support primarily voice services. It will be replaced over time by the CAF. 		Reform intercarrier compensation, which provides implicit subsidies to telephone companies by eliminating per-minute charges over the next 10 years and enabling adequate cost recovery through the CAF. 		Design the new Connect America Fund and <b>Mobility</b> <b>Fund</b> in a tax-efficient manner to minimize the size of the broadband availability gap and thereby reduce contributions borne by consumers. 		Broaden the USF contribution base to ensure USF remains sustainable over time. 	 	 	Create mechanisms to ensure affordability to low-income Americans. 	Expand the Lifeline and Link-Up programs by allowing subsidies provided to low-income Americans to be used for broadband. 	 		Consider licensing a block of spectrum with a condition to offer free or low-cost service that would create affordable alternatives for consumers, reducing the burden on USF. 	 	 	Ensure every American has the opportunity to become digitally literate. 	 		Launch a National Digital Literacy Corps to organize and train youth and adults to teach digital literacy skills and enable private sector programs addressed at breaking adoption barriers. 	 	 4. Updating policies, setting standards and aligning incentives to maximize use for national priorities. Federal, Tribal, state and local governments play an important role in many sectors of our economy. Government is the largest health care payor in the country, operates the public education system, regulates many aspects of the energy industry, provides multiple services to its citizens and has primary responsibility for homeland security. The plan includes recommendations designed to unleash increased use, private sector investment and innovation in these areas. They include the following: 	Health care. Broadband can help improve the quality and lower the cost of health care through health IT and improved data capture and use, which will enable clearer understanding of the most effective treatments and processes. To achieve these objectives, the plan has recommendations that will: 	 		Help ensure health care providers have access to affordable broadband by transforming the FCC’s Rural Health Care Program. 		Create incentives for adoption by expanding reimbursement for e-care. 		Remove barriers to e-care by modernizing regulations like device approval, credentialing, privileging and licensing. 		Drive innovative applications and advanced analytics by ensuring patients have control over their health data and ensuring interoperability of data. 	 	 	Education. Broadband can enable improvements in public education through e-learning and online content, which can provide more personalized learning opportunities for students. Broadband can also facilitate the flow of information, helping teachers, parents, schools and other organizations to make better decisions tied to each student’s needs and abilities. To those ends, the plan includes recommendations to: 	 		Improve the connectivity to schools and libraries by upgrading the FCC’s E-Rate program to increase flexibility, improve program efficiency and foster innovation by promoting the most promising solutions and funding wireless connectivity to learning devices that go home with students. 		 			Accelerate online learning by enabling the creation of digital content and learning systems, removing regulatory barriers and promoting digital literacy. 			Personalize learning and improve decision–making by fostering adoption of electronic educational records and improving financial data transparency in education. 		 		 	 	 	Energy and the environment. Broadband can play a major role in the transition to a clean energy economy. America can use these innovations to reduce carbon pollution, improve our energy efficiency and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. To achieve these objectives, the plan has recommendations that will: 	 		Modernize the electric grid with broadband, making it more reliable and efficient. 		Unleash energy innovation in homes and buildings by making energy data readily accessible to consumers. 		Improve the energy efficiency and environmental impact of the ICT sector. 	 	 	Economic opportunity. Broadband can expand access to jobs and training, support entrepreneurship and small business growth and strengthen community development efforts. The plan includes recommendations to: 	 		Support broadband choice and small businesses’ use of broadband services and applications to drive job creation, growth and productivity gains. 		Expand opportunities for job training and placement through an online platform. 		Integrate broadband assessment and planning into economic development efforts. 	 	 	Government performance and civic engagement. Within government, broadband can drive greater efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery and internal operations. It can also improve the quantity and quality of civic engagement by providing a platform for meaningful engagement with representatives and agencies. Through its own use of broadband, government can support local efforts to deploy broadband, particularly in unserved communities. To achieve these goals, the plan includes recommendations to: 	 		Allow state and local governments to purchase broadband from federal contracts such as Networx. 		Improve government performance and operations through cloud computing, cybersecurity, secure authentication and online service delivery. 		Increase civic engagement by making government more open and transparent, creating a robust public media ecosystem and modernizing the democratic process. 	 	 	Public safety and homeland security. Broadband can bolster efforts to improve public safety and homeland security by allowing first responders to send and receive video and data, by ensuring all Americans can access emergency services and improving the way Americans are notified about emergencies. To achieve these objectives, the plan makes recommendations to: 	 		Support deployment of a nationwide, interoperable public safety mobile broadband network, with funding of up to $ 6. 5 billion in capital expenditures over 10 years, which could be reduced through cost efficiency measures and other programs. Additional funding will be required for operating expenses. 		Promote innovation in the development and deployment of next-generation 911 and emergency alert systems. 		Promote cybersecurity and critical infrastructure survivability to increase user confidence, trust and adoption of broadband communications. 	 	 Long-Term Goals In addition to the recommendations above, the plan recommends that the country adopt and track the following six goals to serve as a compass over the next decade. Goal No. 1 : At least 100 million U. S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second. Goal No. 2 : The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation. Goal No. 3 : Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose. Goal No. 4 : Every American community should have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals and government buildings. Goal No. 5 : To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network. Goal No. 6 : To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption. Meeting these six goals will help achieve the Congressional mandate of using broadband to achieve national purposes, while improving the economics of deployment and adoption. In particular, the first two goals will create the world’s most attractive market for broadband applications, devices and infrastructure and ensure America has the infrastructure to attract the leading communications and IT applications, devices and technologies. The third goal, meanwhile, will ensure every American has the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits broadband offers, including improved health care, better education, access to a greater number of economic opportunities and greater civic participation. Budget Impact of Plan Given the plan’s goal of freeing 500 megahertz of spectrum, future wireless auctions mean the overall plan will be revenue neutral, if not revenue positive. The vast majority of recommendations do not require new government funding; rather, they seek to drive improvements in government efficiency, streamline processes and encourage private activity to promote consumer welfare and national priorities. The funding requests relate to public safety, deployment to unserved areas and adoption efforts. If the spectrum auction recommendations are implemented, the plan is likely to offset the potential costs. Implementation The plan is in beta, and always will be. Like the Internet itself, the plan will always be changing—adjusting to new developments in technologies and markets, reflecting new realities, and evolving to realize the unforeseen opportunities of a particular time. As such, implementation requires a long-term commitment to measuring progress and adjusting programs and policies to improve performance. Half of the recommendations in this plan are offered to the FCC. To begin implementation, the FCC will: 	Quickly publish a timetable of proceedings to implement plan recommendations within its authority. 	Publish an evaluation of plan progress and effectiveness as part of its annual 706 Advanced Services Inquiry. 	Create a Broadband Data Depository as a public resource for broadband information. The remaining half of the recommendations are offered to the Executive Branch, Congress and state and local governments. Policymakers alone, t...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{based on}} plastid DNA sequences {{have recently been}} explored for the genus Grimmia, revealing a complex evolutionary history and many incongruities with respect to traditional views. Based on empirical observations it was postulated that episodes of allopolyploidy and various hybridization events have triggered speciation in the genus Grimmia. Comparisons of genes from different genomes could therefore help to detect putative reticulations that cannot be detected using a single genome. For this purpose phylogenetic inferences, based on the complete ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, were contrasted with plastid (trnS-trnF, trnK/matK) derived ones. The ITS region proved to be highly variable in Grimmia, with various lineage-specific indels interspersed among {{a considerable number of}} conserved regions that contained important phylogenetic information. The sectional placement of most species is congruent with previous results based on plastid DNA. However, some species seemingly combine nuclear sequences of one section with chloroplast sequences of another. The species of Grimmia subg. Grimmia, with the exception of G. pulvinata, are nested within Grimmia in plastid phylogenies, but are sister to the remaining Grimmia groups and closer to Dryptodon based on nuclear DNA sequences. According to the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test an alternative hypothesis in which Grimmia subg. Grimmia is nested within Grimmia could be rejected. Similarly, an alternative topology with G. tergestina close to G. laevigata as revealed by plastid data was clearly rejected by the SH test, supporting the observation that G. tergestina appears to have the nuclear sequence of section Orthogrimmia and the chloroplast sequence of section Guembelia. We hypothesize that both cases can be best explained by past reticulation events. This research was funded by a grant (BOS 2002 - 00285) from the Spanish Ministry of Education to J. Muñoz, a CSICI 3 P Fellowship to R. Hernández-Maqueda, and the <b>mobility</b> <b>funds</b> provided to D. Quandt by the European Commission’s Biodiberia Human Potential Programme.

It extends the “transnational employability” theme of related University and Leonardo <b>Mobility</b> <b>funded</b> collaborative projects involving the Technology School, b. i. b. and EISC Ltd since September 2010. All of the transnational work placement students (one in Munich and six in Hampshire) and their employers confirmed that the placement was entirely beneficial both to the student and to the employer. In particular, one of the students developed an online application for students to use in self-managing the process of meeting work placement documentation and other requirements. Furthermore, the students’ perspective that the experience enhanced their employability is entirely consistent with the literature. Outcomes from the project include: • a life-cycle model for supporting transnational work placement in the curriculum • a first attempt to attract students to transnational work placement using social media • a brief analysis of perspectives of the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to work globally with reference to a published “graduate attributes” framework • example internationalised learning activities related to graduate employability skills development However, there is scope for further development of these pilot outcomes. Whilst conclusions are drawn, all the interview transcripts (which have been checked and approved for publication by the participants) and survey data are provided for others to draw their own conclusions. This project resource is written to be as applicable as possible to other institutions, although there is inevitably some content specific to the collaborating institutions. Finally, this “Connections” project, as evidenced by its reports and events, has indeed connected faculties, services, students and employers within and across institutions and national boundaries.
