There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} <b>migratory</b> <b>route</b> {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird <b>migratory</b> <b>route</b> between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
25|$|Two Pacific Ocean {{populations are}} known to exist: one of not more than 130 {{individuals}} (according {{to the most recent}} population assessment in 2008) whose <b>migratory</b> <b>route</b> is presumed to be between the Sea of Okhotsk and southern Korea, and a larger one with a population between 20,000 and 22,000 individuals in the eastern Pacific traveling between the waters off northernmost Alaska and Baja California Sur. The western population is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. No new reproductive females were recorded in 2010, resulting in a minimum of 26 reproductive females being observed since 1995.

500|$|Modern {{subspecies}} are {{descended from}} elk that once inhabited Beringia, a steppe region between Asia and North America that connected the two continents during the Pleistocene. Beringia provided a <b>migratory</b> <b>route</b> for numerous mammal species, including brown bear, camel, horse, caribou, and moose, {{as well as}} humans. [...] As the Pleistocene came to an end, ocean levels began to rise; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America. In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra, true deserts, and the gulf coast of the U.S. The elk of southern Siberia and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of Lake Baikal including the Sayan and Altai Mountains of Mongolia and the Tianshan region that borders Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China's Xinjiang Province. The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia {{is similar to that}} of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America.|$|E
500|$|Paleo-Indian {{presence}} {{in what is}} now Grand Teton National Park dates back more than 11,000 years. Jackson Hole valley climate at that time was colder and more alpine than the semi-arid climate found today, and the first humans were migratory hunter-gatherers spending summer months in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range. Along the shores of Jackson Lake, fire pits, tools and what are thought to have been fishing weights have been discovered. One of the tools found is of a type associated with the Clovis culture, and tools from this cultural period date back at least 11,500years. Some of the tools are made of obsidian which chemical analysis indicates came from sources near present-day Teton Pass, south of Grand Teton National Park. Though obsidian was also available north of Jackson Hole, virtually all the obsidian spear points found are from a source to the south, indicating that the main seasonal <b>migratory</b> <b>route</b> for the Paleo-Indian was from this direction. Elk, which winter on the National Elk Refuge {{at the southern end of}} Jackson Hole and northwest [...] into higher altitudes during spring and summer, follow a similar migratory pattern to this day. From 11,000 to about 500years ago, there is little evidence of change in the migratory patterns amongst the Native American groups in the region and no evidence that indicates any permanent human settlement.|$|E

50|$|Birds {{that are}} hatched in captivity have no mentor birds {{to teach them}} their {{traditional}} <b>migratory</b> <b>routes.</b> D'Arrigo had one solution to this problem.

The young birds followed him {{not only on the}} ground (as with Lorenz) but also in the air as he took the path of various <b>migratory</b> <b>routes.</b> He flew across the Sahara and over the Mediterranean Sea to Sicily with eagles, from Siberia to Iran (5,500 km) with a flock of Siberian cranes, and over Mount Everest with Nepalese eagles.

50|$|Numerous {{evidence}} {{show the}} importance of the antelope to Andronovo culture settlements. Illustrations of saiga antelopes can be found among the cave paintings that were dated back to seventh-fifth century B.C. Moreover, saiga bones were found among the remains of other wild animals near the human settlements. The fragmented information shows an abundance of saigas on the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 14th-16th centuries. The <b>migratory</b> <b>routes</b> ranged throughout the country's area, especially the region between Volga and Ural rivers was heavily populated. The population's size remained high until {{the second half of the}} 19th century when excessive horn export began. The high price and demand for horns drove radical hunting. The number of animals decreased in all regions and the <b>migratory</b> <b>routes</b> shifted southward.|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{currents}} {{influence the}} choice of <b>migratory</b> <b>routes</b> and flight characteristics of birds {{as well as their}} decisions regarding migration onset and stopovers. Among long distance avian migrants, soaring birds are particularly dependent on wind and updrafts to help them complete their journeys. This review focuses on the behavioral adaptations of migratory soaring birds at various scales with regard to these atmospheric phenomena. Soaring landbirds and soaring seabirds have evolved morphological characteristics that make them specialists in soaring flight, thus enabling them to reduce the costs of migration significantly. We introduce the flight strategies of each group and discuss how <b>migratory</b> <b>routes,</b> flight characteristics, and onset and stopover decisions are all adjusted in relation to atmospheric conditions best suited for soaring. In addition, we discuss briefly how this strong dependence on atmospheric conditions makes soaring birds vulnerable to anthropogenic threats, such as wind energy development and climate change...|$|R

The results indicated that loggerhead juveniles (1) can either show a residential behaviour remaining in the Adriatic throughout the year or perform seasonal migrations to other areas, (2) can remain even in the coldest, northernmost area during winter, (3) can frequent relatively small foraging areas, (4) mostly frequent {{the eastern part of}} the Adriatic, and (5) follow preferred <b>migratory</b> <b>routes</b> along the western and eastern Adriatic coasts. The movements of the adult turtle also revealed (6) a behavioural polymorphism in Mediterranean adults, which included a lack of area fidelity and connection between distant neritic foraging grounds...|$|R
