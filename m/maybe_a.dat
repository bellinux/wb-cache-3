5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> hundred, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> thousand.|$|E

5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> short lecture on {{a topic of}} interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people.

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

25|$|Our {{works in}} stone, in paint, in print are spared, {{some of them}} for a few decades, or a {{millennium}} or two, but everything must finally fall in war or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash.

25|$|During the off-season, English {{attended}} Boston University {{evenings and}} Saturdays to attain her degree. But combining baseball with {{going to college}} nights took her nine years to graduate. Nevertheless, playing professional baseball did help to pay her college expenses. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved from Racine, Wisconsin to Battle Creek, Michigan, English and some original Belles members were disappointment and decided {{not to make the}} move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. English and teammates thought that all would be different, like a new team, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> new manager and, specially, a new location.|$|E

2500|$|Interpretations of the film's {{themes and}} {{messages}} {{have been widely}} discussed among critics and general commentators. In his review for The Washington Times, Peter Suderman expressed that [...] "aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>a</b> libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>a</b> feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>a</b> bloody satire of reality television", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion.|$|R
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|The emperor Avitus finally {{responded to}} Rechiar's {{defiance}} on 456 in autumn, sending the Visigoth king Theodoric II over the Pyrenees and into Galicia, {{at the head}} of a large army of foederati which also included the Burgundians kings Gundioc and Hilperic. The Suevi mobilized their people and both armies met on October 5, by the river Órbigo near Astorga. The Goths of Theoderic II, fighting from the right, defeated the Suevi. While many Sueves were killed in the battle, and many others were captured, most managed to flee. King Rechiar fled wounded in direction to the coast, pursued by the Gothic army, which entered and plundered Braga on October 28. King Rechiar was captured later, in Porto, while trying to embark, being executed in December. After the execution of Rechiar, Theodoric continued his war on the Suevi for three months, but in April 459 he returned to Gaul alarmed by the political and military movements of the new emperor, Majorian, and of the magister militum Ricimer —a half-Sueve, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> kinsman of Rechiar— while his allies and the rest of the Goths sacked Astorga, Palencia and other places, on their way back to the Pyrenees.|$|E
25|$|However, {{infrared}} telescopes have an Achilles heelthey {{need to stay}} extremely cold, and {{the longer}} the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium. This has meant most infrared telescopes have a lifespan limited by their coolant, as short as a few months, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> few years at most. It has been possible to maintain a temperature low enough through {{the design of the}} spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of Spitzer or NEOWISE. Another example is Hubble's NICMOS instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple years, but was then converted to a cryocooler that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sun-shield and radiators with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.|$|E
