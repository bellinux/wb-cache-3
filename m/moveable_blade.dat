50|$|The {{variants}} in {{the design}} of the coypu depend on the builder. The hull is normally glass-reinforced plastic construction, with buoyancy tanks on front, sides, and rear. The centreboard is metal, and the rudder is removable, either fixed (i.e. does not have a downhaul) or with a <b>moveable</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
50|$|A plate switch {{incorporates}} the tapered points {{of a typical}} switch into a self-contained plate. Each point blade is moved separately by hand. Plate switches are only used for double-flanged wheels, with wheels running through the plates on their flanges, guided by {{the edges of the}} plate and the <b>moveable</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Nd:YAG {{surgical}} laser is introduced in laparoscopy and is investigated through comparison with bipolar electrocoagulaion (BEC) in laparoscopic ovariectomy (lapOVE) in healthy dogs, comparing use, complications, hemostasis, and recovery. The Remorgida BEC forceps combines two instruments in one: BEC forceps and sharp resection by an independently <b>moveable</b> knife <b>blade.</b> It {{is compared to}} the Nd:YAG {{surgical laser}} in lapOVE. Because of its dual function, the Remorgida device is expected to enhance laparoscopic surgery and reduce surgery duration...|$|R
