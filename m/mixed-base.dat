E.g., the sexagesimal Babylonian notation and the Chinese rod numerals, which can be classified as standard systems of base 60 and 10, respectively, counting the space representing zero as a numeral, can also be classified as non-standard systems, more specifically, <b>mixed-base</b> systems with unary components, considering the primitive repeated glyphs making up the numerals.|$|E

50|$|Many FFT users, however, prefer natural-order outputs, and a separate, {{explicit}} bit-reversal stage {{can have}} a non-negligible impact on the computation time, even though bit reversal {{can be done in}} O(N) time and {{has been the subject of}} much research. Also, while the permutation is a bit reversal in the radix-2 case, it is more generally an arbitrary (<b>mixed-base)</b> digit reversal for the mixed-radix case, and the permutation algorithms become more complicated to implement. Moreover, it is desirable on many hardware architectures to re-order intermediate stages of the FFT algorithm so that they operate on consecutive (or at least more localized) data elements. To these ends, a number of alternative implementation schemes have been devised for the Cooley-Tukey algorithm that do not require separate bit reversal and/or involve additional permutations at intermediate stages.|$|E
40|$|Multiplex bisulfite-PCR {{sequencing}} is {{a convenient}} and scalable method for the quantitative {{determination of the}} methylation state of target DNA regions. A challenge of this application {{is the presence of}} CpGs in the same region where primers are being placed. A common solution to the presence of CpGs within a primer-binding region is to substitute a base degeneracy at the cytosine position. However, the efficacy of different substitutions {{and the extent to which}} bias towards methylated or unmethylated templates may occur has never been evaluated in bisulfite multiplex sequencing applications. In response, we examined the performance of four different primer substitutions at the cytosine position of CpG 2 ̆ 7 s contained within the PCR primers. In this study, deoxyinosine-, 5 -nitroindole-, <b>mixed-base</b> primers and primers with an abasic site were evaluated across a series of methylated controls. Primers that contained mixed- or deoxyinosine- base modifications performed most robustly. <b>Mixed-base</b> primers were further selected to determine the conditions that induce bias towards methylated templates. This identified an optimized set of conditions where the methylated state of bisulfite DNA templates can be accurately assessed using <b>mixed-base</b> primers, and expands the scope of bisulfite resequencing assays when working with challenging templates...|$|E

40|$|Immediate {{activation}} of biosensors {{is not always}} desirable, particularly if activation is due to non-specific interactions. Here we demonstrate the use of deoxyribozyme-based logic gate networks arranged into visual displays to precisely control {{activation of}} biosensors, and demonstrate a prototype molecular automaton able to discriminate between seven different genotypes of Lyssaviruses, including Rabies virus. The device uses novel <b>mixed-base</b> logic gates to enable detection of the large diversity of Lyssavirus sequence populations, while a NOT logic gate prevents non-specific activation across genotypes.

40|$|Following an {{approach}} used to specifically identify polioviruses and enterovirus 71, {{we have developed}} reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR primers containing <b>mixed-base</b> residues or deoxyinosine at positions of codon degeneracy. These primers permit specific RT-PCR amplification of echovirus 30 (E 30) sequences by targeting sites that encode conserved amino acid motifs within the major capsid protein, VP 1. All 221 E 30 strains tested, isolated in 16 countries over a 44 -year period, yielded the predicted 158 -bp PCR product. No specific products were obtained by PCR assays containing templates {{from any of the}} other 63 EV serotypes.

Oligothymidylate decamers terminated with a 3 '-amino group or containing a 3 '-NHP(O) (O-) O- 5 ' internucleoside link are found to form unusually stable complexes with poly(dA), poly(A), and oligo(dA). For related derivatives of 5 '-amino- 5 '-deoxythymidine enhancement is less or absent, {{and in the case}} of multiple substitution destabilization of the heteroduplex may be observed. That the effect of the 3 '-amino group is general for oligonucleotide derivatives is indicated by enhanced Tm values for heteroduplex complexes of the <b>mixed-base</b> oligomer, d(TATTCAGTCAT(NH 2)), and the methyl phosphonate derivatives, TmTmTmTmTmTmTmTmTmT(NH 2) and d(TmAmTmTmCmAmGmTmCmAmT(NH 2)) ...|$|E

Depurination half-times obtained for dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in methylene chloride {{were found to be}} 3 % DCA >> 15 % DCA > 3 % TCA. In order to understand the implications of depurination during DNA synthesis, the detritylation kinetics of model compounds DMT-dG-pT dimer and DMT-[17 mer] <b>mixed-base</b> sequence were also measured.

40|$|Distinct number {{systems for}} certain objects {{within the same}} {{language}} seem to reveal a lack of abstract thinking and are therefore often taken as cognitively deficient. The case of the Polynesian languages will prove this assumption to be mis-taken. In addition to a general, perfectly consistent, and deci-mal system with high numerals, some of these languages also traditionally applied apparently <b>mixed-base</b> systems {{for a range of}} frequently used objects. Maori, Hawai'ian, and Ton-gan in particular are conspicuous for such ‘irregularities’, and one broadly accepted conjecture is that their decimal systems were introduced by Western missionaries. In order to demon-strate that the opposite is in fact true, this article scrutinizes their main numeration principles.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for determining the serotypes of poliovirus isolates by PCR. Three sets of serotype-specific antisense PCR-initiating primers (primers seroPV 1 A, seroPV 2 A, and seroPV 3 A) were designed to pair with codons of VP 1 amino acid sequences that are conserved within but that differ across serotypes. The sense polarity primers (primers seroPV 1 S, seroPV 2 S, and seroPV 3 S) matched codons of more conserved capsid sequences. The primers contain <b>mixed-base</b> and deoxyinosine residues {{to compensate for the}} high rate of degeneracy of the targeted codons. The serotypes of all polioviruses tested (48 vaccine-related isolates and 110 diverse wild isolates) were correctly identified by PCR with the serotype-specific primers. None of the genomic sequences of 49 nonpolio enterovirus reference strains were amplified under equivalent reaction conditions with any of the three primer sets. These primers are useful for the rapid screening of poliovirus isolates and for determining the compositions of cultures containing mixtures of poliovirus serotypes...|$|E

In this approach, such oligonucleotides {{are used to}} replace a segment of DNA required for a desired function, and functional sequences are identified by an appropriate genetic or biochemical selection. Here, a collection of 500, 000 [corrected] altered beta-lactamase proteins was generated by cloning a <b>mixed-base</b> oligonucleotide {{in place of the}} sequences coding for a 17 -amino acid portion of the enzyme's active site. Approximately 2000 enzymes from this collection were able to confer ampicillin resistance on Escherichia coli. Fifty-eight of these were chosen for further study after characterization with various beta-lactam substrates. beta-Lactamases having altered specificity against different antibiotics, resistance to the suicide inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam, and temperature-dependent activities were obtained. The amino acid residues responsible for these altered properties as well as for basic enzyme activity are defined. This approach should prove to be an effective and general tool for creating proteins with novel properties, especially in situations in which a high-resolution structure of the protein is not known...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{well-known}} Watson-Crick complementarity rules, {{which were}} discovered 50 years ago, elegantly direct the specific pairing of two DNA single strands. On the contrary, once formed, the double-stranded (ds) DNA lacks {{such a simple}} and sequence-universal recognition principle, {{since most of the}} characteristic chemical groups of nucleobases are now buried deep inside the double helix, the major DNA form. We report a promising versatile approach for highly selective recognition of designated sites within dsDNA featuring considerable practical potential for a variety of molecular-biological, biotechnological, gene-therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. It may also have implications for prebiotic evolution of genetic machinery at the primordial stages of the origin of life. Our design synergistically employs the robust helix-invasion ability of recently developed DNA mimics and analogs, pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acids and pseudocomplementary oligonucleotides, thus enabling the sequence-unrestricted recognition of chosen DNA duplexes by nucleobase oligomers. Using this basically general approach, we selectively tagged a unique <b>mixed-base</b> site on the target dsDNA fragment with streptavidin and/or multiply labeled this site with fluorophores via the primer-extension reaction...|$|E
40|$|Few-atom silver {{clusters}} encapsulated by DNA 1 (AgN-DNA) possess unique fluorescence {{properties that}} depend on the specific DNA template that stabilizes the cluster. 2, 3 Particular choices of this template select for fluorescent silver clusters with peak emission wavelengths throughout the visible and near-IR spectrum. 4, 5 This wide color palette, combined with proposed low toxicity, high quantum yields of some clusters, 6 low synthesis costs, and compatibility with DNA have enabled many applications that employ AgN-DNA, including colorimetric sensing for single base mutations, 7, 8 metal ions, 9, 10 and microRNAs, 11 as well as logic devices 12 and cell labeling. 13, 14 Yet despite {{the rapid growth of}} applications relying on these silver clusters, it is not understood why certain <b>mixed-base</b> DNA templates produce brightly fluorescent solutions that are temporally stable while other apparently similar sequences do not. For this reason, template design 15 relies on experimentally testing oligomers with sequences selected by informed guessing. To aid development of applications employing AgN-DNA, we explore methods to efficiently select DNA template sequences that stabilize brightly fluorescent clusters...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} of a PST 2 ̆ 7 s {{understanding}} of regrouping with multidigit whole numbers in base- 10 and non-base- 10 contexts shows that although {{she seems to have}} all the knowledge elements necessary to give a conceptually based explanation of regrouping in the context of 3 -digit numbers, she is unable to do so. This inability may be {{due to a lack of}} connections among various knowledge components (conceptual knowledge) or a lack of connections between knowledge components and context (strategic knowledge). Although she exhibited both conceptual and strategic knowledge of numbers while regrouping 2 -digit numbers, her struggles in explaining regrouping 3 -digit numbers in the context of the standard algorithms indicate that explaining regrouping with 3 -digit is not a mere extension of doing so for 2 -digit numbers. She also accepts an overgeneralization of the standard algorithms for subtraction to a time (<b>mixed-base)</b> context, indicating a lack of recognition of the connections between the base- 10 contexts and the standard algorithms.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} two solid-phase synthetic routes to obtain a nucleo-oligolysine α-peptide containing all four natural nucleobases. The first one {{is based on the}} oligomerization of the nucleobase-containing monomers, easily synthesized as herein described. The second strategy has the advantage of avoiding the solution synthesis of the monomeric building blocks, leading to the final nucleopeptide by direct solid-phase couplings of the suitably protected nucleobases with the free amino groups on the growing peptide chain still anchored to the resin. Both strategies are general and {{can be applied to the}} synthesis of nucleopeptides having backbones formed by any other diamino acid moiety decorated with the four nucleobases. We also report the CD and UV studies on the hybridization properties of the obtained nucleopeptide, containing all four nucleobases on alternate lysines in the sequence, towards complementary DNA and RNA strands. The nucleo-oligolysine with a <b>mixed-base</b> sequence did not prove to bind complementary DNA, but was able to recognize the complementary RNA forming a complex with a higher melting temperature than that of the corresponding RNA/RNA natural duplex and comparable with that of the analogous PNA/RNA system...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for differentiating polioviruses from nonpolio enteroviruses using PCR. A pair of panpoliovirus PCR primers were designed to match intervals encoding amino acid sequences within VP 1 that are strongly conserved among polioviruses. The initiating primer hybridizes with codons of a 7 -amino-acid sequence that has been found only in polioviruses; the second primer matches codons of a domain thought {{to interact with the}} cell receptor. The panpoliovirus PCR primers contain <b>mixed-base</b> and deoxyinosine residues to compensate for the high degeneracy of the targeted codons. All RNAs from 48 vaccine-related and 110 wild poliovirus isolates of all three serotypes served as efficient templates for amplification of 79 -bp product. None of the genomic sequences of 49 nonpolio enterovirus reference strains were amplified under equivalent reaction conditions. Sensitivities of poliovirus detection were as low as 100 fg (equivalent to approximately 25, 000 genomic copies or 25 to 250 PFU) when the amplified products were visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence. These degenerate PCR primers should aid in the detection of all polioviruses, including those wild poliovirus isolates for which genotype-specific reagents are unavailable...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of 2 '-deoxy- 2 '-fluoroarabinonucleic acid (2 'F-ANA) to hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions {{was compared to}} that of DNA, RNA and 2 'F-RNA. In enzyme-free simulated gastric fluid (pH approximately 1. 2), 2 'F-ANA was found to have dramatically increased stability (virtually no cleavage observed after 2 days) with respect to both DNA (t(1 / 2) approximately 2 min) and RNA (t(1 / 2) approximately 3 h (PO) or 3 days (PS)). These results were observed for both phosphodiester and phosphorothioate backbones and with multiple <b>mixed-base</b> sequences. Under basic conditions, 2 'F-ANA also showed good stability. In 1 M NaOH at 65 degrees C, 2 'F-ANA had a t(1 / 2) of approximately 20 h, while RNA was entirely degraded in a few minutes. Furthermore, the nuclease cleavage of phosphorothioate 2 'F-ANA and DNA by snake venom phosphodiesterase was studied in detail. One diastereomer of the PS- 2 'F-ANA linkage was found to be much more vulnerable to enzymatic cleavage than the other, which is parallel to the properties observed for PS-DNA. Additional studies of 2 'F-ANA-containing oligonucleotides are warranted based on the excellent stability properties described her...|$|E
40|$|Peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) is a {{synthetic}} DNA mimic with valuable properties and {{a rapidly growing}} scope of applications. With the exception of recently introduced pseudocomplementary PNAs, binding of common PNA oligomers to target sites located inside linear double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) is essentially restricted to homopurine–homopyrimidine sequence motifs, which significantly hampers some of the PNA applications. Here, we suggest an approach to bypass this limitation of common PNAs. We demonstrate that PNA with mixed composition of ordinary nucleobases is capable of sequence-specific targeting of complementary dsDNA sites if they are located at the very termini of DNA duplex. We then show that such targeting {{makes it possible to}} perform capturing of designated dsDNA fragments via the DNA-bound biotinylated PNA as well as to signal the presence of a specific dsDNA sequence, in the case a PNA beacon is employed. We also examine the PNA–DNA conjugate and prove that it can initiate the primer-extension reaction starting from the duplex DNA termini when a DNA polymerase with the strand-displacement ability is used. We thus conclude that recognition of duplex DNA by <b>mixed-base</b> PNAs via the end invasion has a promising potential for site-specific and sequence-unrestricted DNA manipulation and detection.

40|$|Contamination of soils with {{crude oil}} {{deriving}} from e. g. exploration and processing of petroleum is of major environmental concern. The various compounds {{of crude oil}} are used to produce prod-ucts such as gasoline, kerosene propane, fuel oil, lubricating oil, wax, and asphalt (Atlas 1995). Based {{on the nature of}} the hydrocarbons (HC), crude oil can be classified into three groups: (i) paraffin-based crude oils; (ii) asphaltic-base crude oils and (iii) <b>mixed-base</b> crude oils (Cleveland 2007). Additionally, petroleum contains a complex mixture of compounds which can be categorized into four fractions: saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes (Killops and Al-Jaboori 1990, Outdot et al. 1998). In several oil-producing countries, crude oil is one of the most important contaminants of soils and sediments. Large areas have been contami-nated with petroleum oil near the oil refineries and oil storage tanks. Crude oil may cause land degradation by affecting plants and soil micro-organism. These harmful effects depend on the concentration and type of contaminant (Boethling and Alexander 1979). Bioremediation techniques have become a major tool to enhance natural biodegradation of crude oil residuals (based on indigenous microorganisms). Among the different techniques to enhance natural biodegradation by indigenous microorganisms, inoculation with hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and fertilizing the indigenous population have attracted the most interest. The application of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous was shown to be most effective in accelerating the Effect of N and P fertilisation and aeration on biodegradation of crude oil in aged hydrocarbon contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|Tricyclo-DNA {{belongs to}} the family of conformationally {{restricted}} oligodeoxynucleotide analogues. It differs structurally from DNA by an additional ethylene bridge between the centers C(3 ') and C(5 ') of the nucleosides, to which a cyclopropane unit is fused for further enhancement of structural rigidity. The synthesis of the hitherto unknown tricyclodeoxynucleosides containing the bases cytosine and guanine and of the corresponding phosphoramidite building blocks is described, as well as a structural description of a representative of an alpha- and a beta-tricyclodeoxynucleoside by X-ray analysis. Tricyclodeoxynucleoside building blocks of all four bases were used for the synthesis of fully modified <b>mixed-base</b> oligonucleotides. Their Watson-Crick pairing properties with complementary DNA, RNA, and with itself were investigated by UV melting curves, CD spectroscopy, and molecular modeling. Tricyclo-DNA was found to be a very stable Watson-Crick base-pairing system. A UV melting curve analysis of the decamers tcd(pcgtgacagtt) and tcd(paactgtcacg) showed increased thermal stabilities of up to DeltaT(m) /mod. = + 1. 2 degrees C with complementary DNA and + 2. 4 degrees C with complementary RNA. With itself, tricyclo-DNA showed an increase in stability of + 3. 1 degrees C/base pair relative to DNA. Investigations into the thermodynamic properties of these decamers revealed an entropic stabilization and an enthalpic destabilization for the tricyclo-DNA/DNA duplexes. CD spectroscopic structural investigations indicated that tricyclo-DNA containing duplexes preferrably exist in an A-conformation, a fact which is in agreement with results from molecular modelin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Peptide {{nucleic acids}} (PNAs) bind tightly and sequence-specifically to single- and {{double-stranded}} nu-cleic acids, and are hence {{of interest in}} the design of gene-targeted radiotherapeutics that could deliver the ra-diodamage to designated DNA and/or RNA sites. As a first step towards this goal, we developed a procedure for incorporation of Auger electron-emitting radionu-clide (indium- 111) into PNA oligomers and studied the efficiency of PNA-directed cleavage of single-stranded DNA targets. Accordingly, diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) was conjugated to the lysine-append-ed <b>mixed-base</b> PNAs and sequence-homologous DNA oligomer with a proper linker for comparative studies. By chelation of PNA-DTPA and DNA-DTPA conjugates with 111 In 3 + in acidic aqueous solutions, 111 In-labeled PNA and DNA oligomers were obtained. Targeting of single-stranded DNA with PNA-DTPA-[111 In] conju-gates yielded highly localized DNA strand cleavage; the distribution of breaks along the target DNA strand has two maxima corresponding to both termini of PNA oligomer. After 10 – 14 days, the overall yield of breaks thus generated within the PNA-targeted DNA by 111 In decay was 5 – 7 % versus ≤ 2 % in the case of control oligo-nucleotide DNA-DTPA-[111 In]. The estimated yield of DNA strand breaks per nuclear decay is ~ 0. 1 for the PNA-directed delivery of 111 In, which is three times more than for the DNA-directed delivery of this radionu-clide. This in vitro study shows that 111 In-labeled PNAs are much more effective than radiolabeled DNA oligonu-cleotides for site-specific damaging of DNA targets. Ac-cordingly, we believe that PNA oligomers are promising radionuclide delivery tools for future antisense/antigene radiotherapy trials...|$|E

To support the future surveillance activities, we developed a SYBR green-based, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) for detecting nucleoprotein (NP) genes and subtyping 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) genes simultaneously. Primers were improved by focusing on Eurasian or North American lineage genes; the number of <b>mixed-base</b> positions per primer was set to five or fewer, and the concentration of each primer set was optimized empirically. Also, 30 cycles of amplification of 1 : 10 dilutions of cDNAs from cultured viruses effectively reduced minor cross- or nonspecific reactions. Under these conditions, 346 HA and 345 NA genes of 349 AIVs were detected, with average sensitivities of NP, HA, and NA genes of 101. 5, 102. 3, and 103. 1 50 % egg infective doses, respectively. Utility of rRT-PCR for subtyping AIVs was {{compared with that of}} current standard serological tests by using 104 recent migratory duck virus isolates. As a result, all HA genes and 99 % of the NA genes were genetically subtyped, while only 45 % of HA genes and 74 % of NA genes were serologically subtyped. Additionally, direct subtyping of AIVs in fecal samples was possible by 40 cycles of amplification: approximately 70 % of HA and NA genes of NP gene-positive samples were successfully subtyped. This validation study indicates that rRT-PCR with optimized primers and reaction conditions is a powerful tool for subtyping varied AIVs in clinical and cultured samples...|$|E
40|$|If adenines and thymines in two {{mutually}} complementary <b>mixed-base</b> peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) oligomers are substituted with diaminopurines and thiouracils, respectively, so-called pseudocomplementary PNAs (pcPNAs) are created. Pairs of pcPNAs have recently demonstrated an ability to highly selectively target essentially any designated site on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by forming very stable PNA–DNA strand-displacement complexes via double duplex invasion (helix invasion). These properties of pcPNAs make them unique and very promising ligands capable of denying the access of DNA-binding proteins to dsDNA. To elucidate the sequence-unrestricted mechanism of sequence-specific dsDNA recognition by pcPNAs, we have studied the kinetics of formation of corresponding PNA–DNA complexes at various temperatures by the gel-shift assay. In parallel, the conditions for possible self-hybridization of pcPNA oligomers have been assayed by mixing curve (Job plot) and thermal melting experiments. The data indicate that, at physiological temperatures (≈ 37 °C), the equilibrium is shifted toward the pairing of corresponding pcPNAs with each other. This finding explains a linear concentration dependence, within the submicromolar range, of the pcPNA invasion rate into dsDNA at 37 °C. At elevated temperatures (> 50 °C), the rather unstable pcPNA duplexes dissociate, yielding the expected quadratic dependence for the rate of pcPNA invasion on the PNA concentration. The polycationic character of pcPNA pairs, carrying the duplicated number of protonated terminal PNA residues commonly used to increase the PNA solubility and binding affinity, also explains the self-inhibition of pcPNA invasion observed at higher PNA concentrations. Melting of pcPNA duplexes occurs with the integral transition enthalpies ranged from − 235 to − 280 kJ⋅mol− 1, contributing to an anomalously high activation energy of ≈ 150 kJ⋅mol− 1 found for the helix invasion of pcPNAs carrying four different nucleobases. A simplified kinetic model for pcPNAs helix invasion is proposed that interprets all unusual features of pcPNAs binding to dsDNA.
