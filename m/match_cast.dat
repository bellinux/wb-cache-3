40|$|Matching {{articulated}} shapes {{represented by}} voxel-sets reduces to maximal sub-graph isomorphism when each set {{is described by}} a weighted graph. Spectral graph theory {{can be used to}} map these graphs onto lower dimensional spaces and match shapes by aligning their embeddings in virtue of their invariance to change of pose. Classical graph isomorphism schemes relying on the ordering of the eigenvalues to align the eigenspaces fail when handling large data-sets or noisy data. We derive a new formulation that finds the best alignment between two congruent K-dimensional sets of points by selecting the best subset of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian matrix. The selection is done by matching eigenfunction signatures built with histograms, and the retained set provides a smart initialization for the alignment problem with a considerable impact on the overall performance. Dense shape <b>matching</b> <b>casted</b> into graph <b>matching</b> reduces then, to point registration of embeddings under orthogonal transformations; the registration is solved using the framework of unsupervised clustering and the EM algorithm. Maximal subset matching of non identical shapes is handled by defining an appropriate outlier class.

40|$|In a fatigue loaded {{structure}} made of Very High Strength Steels (VHSS) {{absolute and}} relative stress variations {{will be higher}} compared to those in structures made of lower grade steels. Stress concentrations in joints reduce the advantage of VHSS under cyclic loading. A hybrid connection, consisting of cast steel welded to a VHSS member, could make the use of VHSS relatively more efficient. If designed properly, cast steel parts could result in welded joints with low stress concentrations, by shifting welds out of the most severe stress location. In a recent test program at the Delft University of Technology hybrid VHSS plate connections have been tested under cyclic loading. In the research the yield strength of the plates has been varied.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} some {{concepts and}} methods for low level computer vision and learning, with object recognition {{as the primary}} application. An efficient method for detection of local rotational symmetries in images is presented. Rotational symmetries include circle patterns, star patterns, and certain high curvature patterns. The method for detection of these patterns is based on local moments computed on a local orientation description in double angle representation, which makes the detection invariant to {{the sign of the}} local direction vectors. Some methods are also suggested to increase the selectivity of the detection method. The symmetries can serve as feature descriptors and interest points for use in hierarchical matching structures for object recognition and related problems. A view-based method for 3 D object recognition and estimation of object pose from a single image is also presented. The method is based on simple feature vector matching and clustering. Local orientation regions computed at interest points are used as features for matching. The regions are computed such that they are invariant to translation, rotation, and locally invariant to scale. Each <b>match</b> <b>casts</b> a vote on a certain object pose, rotation, scale, and position, and a joint estimate is found by a clustering procedure. The method is demonstrated on a number of real images and the region features are compared with the SIFT descriptor, which is another standard region feature for the same application. Finally, a new associative network is presented which applies the channel representation for both input and output data. This representation is sparse and monopolar, and is a simple yet powerful representation of scalars and vectors. It is especially suited for representation of several values simultaneously, a property that is inherited by the network and something which is useful in many computer vision problems. The chosen representation enables us to use a simple linear model for non-linear mappings. The linear model parameters are found by solving a least squares problem with a non-negative constraint, which gives a sparse regularized solution...|$|R
