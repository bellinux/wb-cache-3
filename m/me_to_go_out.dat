I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|CMH {{distributor}} World's Fair promoted The Return of Dr. Octagon as {{the official}} sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst, and claimed that Thornton would tour {{in support of the}} album. Early news stories reported by outlets such as The Guardian, MTV2, MySpace, Remix Magazine, and The Washington Post endorsed the label's claims. Internet rumors began to spread that the album had been released without Thornton's authorization via {{what turned out to be}} an unsubstantiated piece of journalism by David Downs. In August, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not promote the album. According to Thornton, [...] "This ain't the record I did. It was totally new music. I was really pissed off about people wanting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and tour and do these songs." [...] OCD originally intended to ship 50,000 units during the first year, but halted the plan due to the remarkably high volume of downloads received by the online remixes.|$|E
500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E

[...] Regarding going solo, Walker said, [...] "Management {{came to me and}} I thought {{that it was time to}} do my own show.

Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. He was telling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chauncey Yellow Robe ("Kills in the Woods") (Canowicakte) {{was born}} {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Montana around 1867, in the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in Lakota or [...] "Burnt Thighs Nation." [...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard my father used to wake me up out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and lay down in the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if it was a man or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the Great Mystery. [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E
