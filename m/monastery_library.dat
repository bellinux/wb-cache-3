The only complete edition of this text is that in Chinese. Sanskrit fragments from this text have been found in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and are now part of the Schøyen Collection (MS 2375/08). The manuscripts at this find are thought to have been part of a <b>monastery</b> <b>library</b> of the Mahāsāṃghika Lokottaravāda sect.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} picturisation of Umberto Eco's novel "The {{name of the}} rose", <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries</b> are {{perceived}} by the public as inaccessible silos of valuable knowledge. It is less known that today's <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries</b> – provided that there is staff – are open for the public. Several of the libraries had to sell parts of their collections due to financial reasons. In order to facilitate reconstructing the provenance of books and manuscripts sold by <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries,</b> {{it is necessary to}} catalogue the collections as soon as possible. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, an overview of the current situation of Austria's <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries</b> is given. In the second part, the basics of the European union's "digital heritage" policy are presented with a focus on the cataloguing and presentation of cultural assets from Austrian <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries.</b> As an appendix, a list of 95 Austrian monastic libraries and statistic data about those libraries are provided...|$|R

25|$|The monks {{dedicated}} {{their lives}} to religious meditation, creating illuminated manuscripts in a scriptorium. The monks from the monastery produced an early authoritative history on Portugal {{in a series of}} books. The library at Alcobaça was one of the largest Portuguese mediaeval libraries, but was pillaged by the invading French in 1810, and many items were stolen in an anti-clerical riot in 1834, when the religious orders in Portugal were dissolved. The remnants of the <b>monastery</b> <b>library,</b> including hundreds of mediaeval manuscripts, are kept today in the National Library in Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|Wiborada {{was born}} to a wealthy noble family in Swabia. When they invited the sick and poor into their home, Wiborada proved a capable nurse. her brother Hatto became a priest. A pilgrimage to Rome {{influenced}} Hatto to decide to become a monk at St. Gall Abbey, a decision which Wiborada supported. After {{the death of their}} parents, Wiborada joined Hatto and became a Benedictine at the Abbey of St. Gall. Wiborada became settled at the monastery, and Hatto taught her Latin so that she could chant the Divine Office. There, she occupied herself by making Hatto's clothes and helping to bind many of the books in the <b>monastery</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E
25|$|The library also {{preserves}} {{a unique}} 9th-century document, {{known as the}} Plan of St. Gall, the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire and the 13th century. The Plan drawn was never actually built, and was so named because it was kept at the famous medieval <b>monastery</b> <b>library,</b> where it remains to this day. The plan was an ideal of what a well-designed and well-supplied monastery should have, as envisioned by one of the synods held at Aachen for the reform of monasticism in the Frankish empire {{during the early years of}} emperor Louis the Pious (between 814 and 817).|$|E

Other than Tudor (Kulygin's trustee), Dumitriu, Mironescu, and Scrima, {{the group had}} among its members some {{high-profile}} intellectuals of various backgrounds. They include the avant-garde author Marcel Avramescu and critic Vladimir Streinu, poet-scientist Ion Barbu, mathematicians Valentin Poénaru and Octav Onicescu, novelist Ion Marin Sadoveanu, poet-physician Vasile Voiculescu etc. Together with historian Virgil Cândea came a cell of social scientists and classical scholars, among them Alexandru Duțu. They were joined by high-profile Orthodox clergymen: Ghiuș, Dumitru Stăniloae, Sofian Boghiu and Arsenie Papacioc. Another occasional guest was Bartolomeu Anania, the outspoken anti-communist priest.|$|E
500|$|The {{foremost}} document {{containing the}} work of Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered {{that it was a}} palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a <b>monastery</b> <b>library</b> in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at Christie's in New York. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of On Floating Bodies in the original Greek. It is the only known source of The Method of Mechanical Theorems, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. Stomachion was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of ultraviolet and [...] light to read the overwritten text.|$|E

This essay presents an overview of mostly German-language scholarship, including many older studies, dealing with the dissolution and disposition of <b>monastery</b> <b>libraries</b> across German-speaking Europe during these decades.

Comprehensive analyzing of the Cyrillic books in the libraries of Krekhiv, Vicyn and Zolochiv monasteries represent this topic. It is made the content studying of the library except “church” (liturgical) books, because the last ones were Church Slavonic in the uniate and the orthodox monasteries as well.

In general, as big as small basilian <b>monasteries</b> <b>libraries</b> in the 18 century mostly consisted of the Latin and Polish books, but also there were Cyrillic books. In the Krekhiv monastery Church Fathers treatises were mostly Cyrillic. For instance there were the works of St. John Chrysostom, St. Basil the Great, Dorotheus of Gaza, Gregory the Theologian and others. Also some monasteries had a few Cyrillic hagiographic (compendiums of lives of the Saints) and homiletic (collections of sermons) books.
