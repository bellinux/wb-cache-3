40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of ethyl oleate because of its insufficient purity. The following compounds {{are considered to be}} safe for all animal species at the use level proposed for feed flavourings: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, oleic acid, decanol, dodecanol, decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. The remaining substances are considered safe for all animal species at 5 mg/kg complete feed (with a margin of safety between 1 and 120) and at 25 mg/kg complete feed (ethyl acetate and hexyl acetate, with a margin of safety between 2 and 6); and at 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species (ethylacrylate, ethyl hex- 3 -enoate, ethyl trans- 2 -butenoate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, <b>methyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> hexyl isobutyrate, methyl 2 -methyl butyrate, pentyl isovalerate, butyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl isovalerate, ethyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl 2 -methyl butyrate and methyl 2 -methylvalerate). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 1 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat all compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitizers. No risk for the safety for the environment is foreseen. Since all 85 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, a {{systematic}} {{framework for the}} design and analysis of solvents in reaction systems is developed using computer aided molecular design (CAMD) technique. The framework consists of problem formulation, solution strategy development, and uncertainty analysis. Solvents as mass separation agents (MSAs) to increase the productivity of the reaction {{play an important role}} in a fermentation or reversible reaction. A number of solvent characteristics including biocompatibility, inertness, and phase-splitting capability are identified as important properties of the candidate solvent. Group contribution approaches are employed to characterize the relation between physical properties and the structure of the compound. The resulting mathematical programming model is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, which involves continuous and binary structural variables. An outer approximation (OA) based algorithm is tailored to solve the MINLP model. Using the above methodology, n-Octane is identified as the optimal solvent for ethanol fermentation with maximum extraction efficiency, while isopropyl propionate and <b>methyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> are the optimal solvents with the minimum mass flow rate. ^ To overcome the limitation of the OA based algorithm that may end up with a locally optimal solution for solving nonconvex MINLP, a hybrid global optimization approach, namely OA_Global, is developed. It incorporates a soft computing (simulated annealing) approach with outer approximation with equality relaxation and augmented penalty (OA/ER/AP). The simulated annealing method can find a global solution with an asymptotic convergence guarantee in probability. Although the proposed approach is not provably globally optimal, computational experience with benchmark examples and solvent design MINLP models indicate that this approach gives near global optimal solutions. ^ Uncertainty resulting from the physical property modeling is characterized through the flexibility analysis technique on chemical processes. The value of a feasibility function is calculated to measure how the uncertainty issues affect the designed molecules. Due to the multiextremality and nondifferentiability of the feasibility function, novel optimization approaches (BB and BB_ACTIVE) that avoid explicit enumerations are developed to evaluate this feasibility function. Case studies on chemical processes and molecular design indicate that these two approaches are computationally efficient. ...|$|E
