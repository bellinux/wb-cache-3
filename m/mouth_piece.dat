Every year nearly 135,000 {{children}} ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities. Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing head gear can help prevent concussions. Also wearing a frontal paid that protects the forehead and {{top of the head}} is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion.

2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and <b>mouth</b> <b>piece,</b> and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran {{across the top of}} the cap and {{terminated}} at front and back. It was made of [...] "D-sectioned" [...] tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted [...] "U-shaped" [...] piece into which a [...] "flat bottom strip" [...] was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and <b>mouth</b> <b>piece</b> which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and <b>mouth</b> <b>piece.</b> Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered. A tracer (a [...] "rather blunt chisel [...] [...] [...] used chiefly for outlining") was used to provide a grooved border on each side. Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and surrounded by niello. Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were chased [...] "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge." [...] This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge. Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head, or adorned with silver or niello, the nose and <b>mouth</b> <b>piece</b> was heavily gilded, which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been [...] "applied by the fire-gilding technique." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} change {{began in the}} establishment of Victorian society in Europe. In an attempt to civilize anything that seemed coarse or uncivil, much of Victorian society would adapt cultural items to suit their tastes. Ironically the British adopted the paper wrapped minced tobacco. Such an item, originally relegated to the poor in Spain, seemed at face value a contradiction; however, one must consider the need for human manipulation of tobacco, including, chopping it up, wrapping it in a man-made piece of paper, and then inserting it into a piece of cane for a <b>mouth</b> <b>piece.</b> One can then see that this was just another way of civilizing part of the coarser aspects of the British Empire. A feministic culture dominated smoking at this time as well as lots of tobacco, and this gave further rise to this [...] "dainty" [...] cigarette, bearing a feminine name.|$|E

The deceleration phase of the arm was prolonged when the small piece of cheese had to be brought to the mouth with respect to when the large piece of cheese had to be brought to the mouth. Temporal coupling between the time of maximum peak deceleration and the maximum mouth aperture was found in seven of the ten subjects.
