5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong <b>monofilament</b> fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E

The most discussed property for long standing is resilience of <b>monofilaments.</b> Therefore the pa/ter it will be focused on the behaviour of <b>monofilaments.</b> The production line of <b>monofilaments</b> was similar to the industrial one. For a detailed sti/ctural analysis are employed three different methods of morphological investigation: DSC, X-ray and Raman. For long term behaviour of <b>monofilaments</b> the dynamic bending test is performed. Based on the obtained results the behaviour of heat treatment samples ivac improved. This was explained by the increase of the amount of Gauche and Trans structure on the third phase...|$|R

This paper discusses a critical appraisal of the factors affecting on the bending behaviour of uniaxially oriented <b>monofilaments</b> prepared from LLDPE. The focus is to characterise the bending behaviour by studying it in function of {{the thickness of the}} <b>monofilaments</b> and the orientation. The <b>monofilaments</b> of LLDPE were characterized by combining the tensile testing and bending behaviour on dynamic and static bending mode. Beside this <b>monofilaments</b> were characterized for micro-structural details such as amorphous phase orientation, degree of crystallinity and intermediate phase structure. It was found that the relationship between bending behaviour and thickness is very much dependent on the degree of the orientation (DR) of <b>monofilaments.</b> There are remarkable differences between less and high oriented filaments samples...|$|R

25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of <b>monofilament</b> nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of <b>monofilament</b> nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this <b>monofilament</b> butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{artificial}} turf surfaces based on LLDPE <b>monofilaments</b> {{have the potential to}} replace natural turf surfaces used for several sport surfaces. Even though the production parameters have a strong influence on the behaviour of <b>monofilaments</b> and indirectly on the final product, the effect of heat treatment at different stages of the production lines is not studied in detail. Therefore, the influence of heat treatment during the production of <b>monofilaments</b> was investigated. This investigation includes a study of the mechanical properties such as tensile testing and bending behaviour and morphological analyses by employing DSC measurements. The results show that the applied heat treatment has a strong influence on the bending behaviour even though the classical studied morphology structures do not show significant changes. Heat treatment influences quite importantly the characteristics of the non-crystalline part of the <b>monofilaments</b> and results in better long-term properties, such as resilience, deformation recovery and fibrillation resistance...|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of fine synthetic fibres such as nylon {{in the construction}} of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, multifilament nylon, <b>monofilament</b> or multimonofilament fibres become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.|$|E
25|$|It was the {{development}} of inexpensive fiberglass rods, synthetic fly lines, and <b>monofilament</b> leaders, however, in the early 1950s, that revived the popularity of fly fishing. In recent years, interest in fly fishing has surged as baby boomers have discovered the sport.

25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible <b>monofilament</b> line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{a detailed}} morphological study of cold-drawn polyethylene <b>monofilaments</b> by Raman spectroscopy, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and X-ray measurements. The structure of the three-phase morphology of the {{linear low density polyethylene}} <b>monofilaments</b> was investigated by combining these measurements. It was found that the most important structure variation was found in the intermediate or rigid amorphous phase, whereby the amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases were nearly constant and almost independent of the cold draw ratio. The intermediate third phase contains gauche and trans molecules and the amount of trans molecules was increased with the cold draw ratio and was directly related to this 2 cold draw ratio. The resulted mechanical properties of the oriented <b>monofilaments</b> are related to the amount of the trans content in the third phase, a result of the transformation of the gauche molecules into trans molecules due to the cold drawing of the <b>monofilaments.</b> It was found that the two peaks in the Raman spectra, respectively at 1303 and 1295 cm- 1, can be correlated to the amount of gauche and trans molecules in the polyethylene <b>monofilaments.</b> A good and new insight into the three phase morphology was obtained by combining the DSC and X-ray measurements with the amounts of trans and gauche molecules from the Raman spectra analysis...|$|R

25|$|Another alternative, {{suitable}} for solid wall enclosures, is to {{attach to the}} wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon <b>monofilament</b> that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls {{on the underside of}} the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.|$|E

25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target.

Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} and fracture {{mechanisms in}} tension were studied in single-crystal Er 2 O 3 -doped ZrO 2 <b>monofilaments</b> processed by the laser-heated floating zone method. Tensile tests {{were carried out}} between 25 ° and 1400 °C at different loading rates and the dominant deformation and fracture mechanisms were determined from {{the shape of the}} stress–strain curves, the morphology of the fracture surfaces, and the evidence provided by <b>monofilaments</b> deformed at high temperature and broken at ambient temperature. The tensile strength presented a minimum at 600 °– 800 °C and it was controlled by the slow growth of a crack from the surface. This mechanism was also dominant in some <b>monofilaments</b> tested at 1000 °C and above, while others showed extensive plastic deformation before fracture at these temperatures. The strength of plastically deformed <b>monofilaments</b> was significantly higher than those which failed by slow crack growth due to the marked strain hardening capacity of this material.

40|$|Background: Allodynia is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} symptom in many patients with neuropathic pain. Whereas quantification of pain mostly depends on subjective pain reports, allodynia can also be measured objectively with quantitative sensory testing. In this pilot study, we investigated the clinical relevance of quantitative sensory testing with Von Frey <b>monofilaments</b> in patients with allodynia {{as a consequence of}} a neuropathic pain syndrome, by means of correlating subjective pain scores with pain thresholds obtained with quantitative sensory testing. Methods: During a 4 -week trial, we administered a cannabis extract to 17 patients with allodynia. We quantified the severity of the allodynia with Von Frey <b>monofilaments</b> before, during and after the patients finished the trial. We also asked the patients to rate their pain on a numeric rating scale at these three moments. Results: We found that most of the effect of the cannabis occurred in the last 2 weeks of the trial. In this phase, we observed that the pain thresholds, as measured with Von Frey <b>monofilaments,</b> were inversely correlated with a decrease of the perceived pain intensity. Conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate clinical relevance of quantitative sensory testing with Von Frey <b>monofilaments</b> in the quantification of allodynia in patients with neuropathic pain, although confirmation of our data is still required in further studies to position this method of quantitative sensory testing as a valuable tool, for example, in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions for neuropathic pain...|$|R

2500|$|With a fixed spool, spincast reels can cast lighter lures than bait cast reels, {{although}} friction of {{the nose}} cone guide and spool cup against the uncoiling line reduces casting distance compared to spinning reels. [...] Spincast reel design {{requires the use of}} narrow spools with less line capacity than either baitcasting or spinning reels of equivalent size, and cannot be made significantly larger in diameter without making the reel too tall and unwieldy. [...] These limitations severely restrict the use of spin cast reels in situations such as fishing at depth, when casting long distances, or where fish can be expected to make long runs. [...] Like other types of reels, spin cast reels are frequently fitted with both anti-reverse mechanisms and friction drags, and some also have level-wind (oscillating spool) mechanisms. [...] Most spin cast reels operate best with limp <b>monofilament</b> lines, though at least one spin cast reel manufacturer installs a thermally fused [...] "superline" [...] into one of its models as standard equipment.
