The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in the attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} impact of winning and losing in {{parliamentary}} systems on protest behavior.

In the empirical analysis, I provide support for my argument using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) survey from 2001 to 2006. The results suggest that losers in single party, majority systems were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to protest <b>than</b> their counterparts in coalition systems. In addition, while it is unclear whether winning and losing had an effect on protest behavior in coalition systems, losers in single party, majority systems were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to protest <b>than</b> winners...|$|R

40|$|When novel {{behaviour}} patterns {{spread through}} animal populations, typically one animal will initiate the diffusion. It {{is not known}} whether such ‘innovators’ are particularly creative individuals, individuals exposed to the appropriate environmental contingencies, or individuals in a particular motivational state. We describe three experiments that investigated the factors influencing foraging innovation in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed small laboratory populations of fish to novel foraging tasks, which involved exploration and problem solving to locate a novel food source. Experiments 1 and 2 found that (1) females were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to innovate <b>than</b> males, (2) food-deprived fish were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to innovate <b>than</b> nonfood-deprived subjects, and (3) smaller fish were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to innovate <b>than</b> larger fish. We suggest that the sex difference may reflect parental investment asymmetries in males and females. Experiment 3 found that past innovators were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to innovate <b>than</b> past noninnovators. Collectively, {{the results suggest that}} differences in foraging innovation in guppies are best accounted for by differences in motivational state, but, in addition, guppies may vary in their predisposition to innovate...|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples.

In addition, women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
