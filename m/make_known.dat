5|$|The Disasters of War (Spanish: Los desastres de la guerra) is {{a series}} of 82 prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and {{printmaker}} Francisco Goya (1746–1828). Although Goya did not <b>make</b> <b>known</b> his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808–14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. During the conflicts between Napoleon's French Empire and Spain, Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers. Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath. He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons. In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most print room collections have {{at least some of the}} set.|$|E

25|$|Although {{this attack}} owed much to Junimeas discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, {{probably}} due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy. In May 1892, he used a public conference at the Romanian Athenaeum as a venue to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures. Caragiale also wrote Două note ("Two Notes"), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu's poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain. Around that time, he ceased contributing to Convorbiri Literare.|$|E
25|$|Following Alma's {{words to}} his sons, {{he and his}} sons (including, presumably, Helaman) went among the people for a time, preaching the word of God. Shortly afterward, in the 19th year {{of the reign of}} the judges (c. 73 BC), Alma {{approached}} Helaman for an important conversation. In what some consider a good model for child-parent interviews, Alma questioned Helaman, praised him for his beliefs, and blessed him. Alma also dictated to him a prophecy of the destruction of the Nephites, which Alma commanded him to record but not to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> until it was fulfilled. Not long after his charge to Helaman, Alma departed and was never heard of again.|$|E

On 16 November 2007, the BBC and the Daily Mirror reported that Eduard Koltsov, a Soviet frogman, {{claimed to have}} caught Crabb placing a mine on the Ordzhonikidze hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed {{to a young man}} whose beauty the poems <b>make</b> <b>known.</b> The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E

25|$|This {{movement}} of d'Erlon's Corps admits of being satisfactorily explained. Napoleon, having received information that d'Erlon {{had been left}} in reserve in front of Grosselies, and inferring, perhaps, from this circumstance that Ney was sufficiently strong {{to be able to}} hold his ground at Quatre Bras, without further aid than what he had at hand, resolved upon employing the I Corps upon the Prussian right flank; but in the meantime, d'Erlon had, in pursuance of instructions from Ney, continued his march towards Quatre Bras; and having himself proceeded in advance, had reached Frasnes, at which place Colonel Laurent found him, and communicated to him Napoleon's order for the march of the I Corps upon Saint-Amand; adding that on coming up with the head of his column, he had taken upon himself to change its direction of march into that of Saint-Amand. D'Erlon hastened to comply with Napoleon's wishes, and despatched General d'Elcambre, his chief of the staff, to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> the movement to Marshal Ney.|$|E
25|$|Pedro de Mendoza, on {{whom the}} country was next bestowed, founded Buenos Aires, but did not venture south. Alonzo de Camargo (1539), Juan Ladrilleros (1557) and Hurtado de Mendoza (1558) helped to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> the Pacific coasts, and while Sir Francis Drake's voyage in 1577 down the Atlantic coast, through the Strait of Magellan and northward along the Pacific coast was memorable, yet the {{descriptions}} of the geography of Patagonia owe much more to the Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1579–1580), who, devoting himself especially to the south-west region, made careful and accurate surveys. The settlements which he founded at Nombre de Dios and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before Thomas Cavendish visited it in 1587 and so desolate that he called it Port Famine. After {{the discovery of the}} route around Cape Horn the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the eighteenth century when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San José, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a de jure sovereignty over area.|$|E

500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story.

[...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
500|$|Tintin and Haddock {{end up on}} {{the same}} pyre as Calculus. Tintin has, however, chosen the hour of their death to {{coincide}} with a solar eclipse, and with a little play-acting, the terrified Incas believe that Tintin can command the Sun. The Inca prince implores Tintin to make the Sun show its light again. At Tintin's command, the Sun returns, and the three are quickly set free. Afterwards, the Prince of the Sun tells them that the seven crystal balls used on the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members, who had excavated Rascar Capac's tomb, contained a [...] "mystic liquid" [...] obtained from coca that plunged them into a deep sleep. Each time the Inca high priest cast his spell over seven wax figures of the explorers, he could use them as he willed as punishment for their sacrilege. Tintin convinces the Inca prince that the explorers wished only to <b>make</b> <b>known</b> to the world the splendours of their civilisation. The Inca prince orders Chiquito to destroy the wax figures, and at that moment in Europe the seven explorers awaken. After swearing an oath to keep the temple's existence a secret, Tintin, Haddock and Calculus head home, while Zorrino remains with the Inca, having accepted an offer to live among them.|$|E
