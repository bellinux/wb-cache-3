40|$|Benzylisoquinoline {{alkaloids}} (BIAs) are {{a diverse}} group of biologically active specialized metabolites produced mainly in four plant families. BIA metabolism is likely of monophyletic origin and involves multiple enzymes yielding structurally diverse compounds. Several BIAs possess defensive properties against pathogenic microorganisms and herbivores. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum: Papaveraceae) has emerged as a model system to investigate the cellular localization of BIA biosynthesis. Although alkaloids accumulate in the laticifer cytoplasm (latex) of opium poppy, corresponding biosynthetic enzymes and gene transcripts are localized to proximal sieve elements and companion cells, respectively. In contrast, BIA metabolism in the non-laticiferous <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Thalictrum flavum; Ranunculaceae) occurs independent of the phloem. Evidence points toward the adoption of diverse strategies for the biosynthesis and accumulation of alkaloids as defensive compounds.

40|$|Askham Bog is {{the remnant}} of a valley-mire which formed between two ridges of glacial moraine in the Vale of York just {{southwest}} of the City. Base-rich ground-water draining the moraines {{has led to the}} development of a rich-fen community which demonstrates stages in seral succession to fen woodland. In the central areas there is a poor-fen community, thought to represent incipient raised-bog, where vegetation has grown above the influence of the ground-water and conditions have become acidic through the leaching action of rain-water and the growth of bog mosses Sphagnum spp. The present habitats are considered to be secondary, raised-bog having largely replaced the original fen before peat-cutting in the Middle Ages brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground-water with the consequent reversion to fen conditions. The majority of the site consists of birch Betula pubescens and oak Quercus robur woodland with alder Alnus glutinosa at the dyke margins.

40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{relationship}} between rain-use efficiency (RUE) and climate conditions {{is crucial for}} predicting the steady-state responses of an ecosystem to climate variations. We clarified the spatial variations of RUE in different ecosystems along both mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) gradients in the Three-river Headwaters Region (THR) of China. RUE displayed a unimodal pattern along a MAP gradient across different ecosystems, with a higher value in forest, shrub, and less-arid alpine meadow than in alpine steppe, alpine talus vegetation, and more-arid alpine <b>meadow.</b> <b>RUE</b> followed an increasing trend along the MAT gradient both in a given ecosystem and across various ecosystems.

40|$|We used a new {{sedimentary}} {{record from}} a small kettle wetland to reconstruct the Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation and fire history of the Krutoberegovo-Ust Kamchatsk region in eastern Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia). Pollen and charcoal {{data suggest that the}} Late Glacial landscape was dominated by a relatively fire-prone Larix forest-tundra during the Greenland Interstadial complex (GI 1) and a subarctic steppe during the Younger Dryas (GS 1). The onset of the Holocene is marked by the reappearance of trees (mainly Alnus incana) within a fern and shrub dominated landscape. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) features shifting vegetational communities dominated by Alnus shrubs, diverse forb species, and locally abundant aquatic plants. The HTM is further defined by the first appearance of stone birch forests (Betula ermanii) – Kamchatka's most abundant modern tree species. The Late Holocene is marked by shifts in forest dynamics and forest-graminoid ratio and the appearance of new non-arboreal taxa such as bayberry (Myrica) and <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Filipendula). Kamchatka is one of Earth's most active volcanic regions. During the Late Glacial and Holocene, Kamchatka's volcanoes spread large quantities of tephra over the study region. Thirty-four tephra falls have been identified at the site.

40|$|International audienceThe enzyme (S) -Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS; EC 4. 2. 1. 78) {{found in}} the common <b>meadow</b> <b>rue,</b> Thalictrum flavum, and other plant species is {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). This group of plant secondary metabolites comprises pharmacologically active compounds like morphine and codeine. NCS catalyzes the condensation of 4 -hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4 -HPAA) and dopamine to (S) -norcoclaurine, the common precursor of all plant BIAs. While enzymatic properties of NCS and mechanistic aspects of the reaction have been studied in detail, no structural information on NCS was available so far. The enzyme shows significant sequence homology to members of class 10 of pathogenesis related proteins (PR 10 proteins) such as the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Our CD and NMR spectroscopic data indicated high similarity of the NCS and the Bet v 1 fold and allowed us to model NCS using Bet v 1 as a template. Virtually complete backbone assignment of the NCS sequence was used to study substrate binding by NMR titration experiments. While binding of 4 -HPAA seems to induce side chain rearrangements in an extensive part of the protein, the putative distinct interaction site for dopamine could be clearly identified. The oligomerization state of NCS that reportedly {{plays an important role in}} enzyme functionality was determined to be concentration-dependent by size exclusion chromatography as well as NMR relaxation measurements, and the enzyme is predominantly monomer at the low micromolar concentrations used for activity assays...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{communities}} forming {{associations with}} plant roots {{have generally been}} described as ranging from symbiotic to parasitic. Disruptions to these associations consequently can have significant impacts on native plant communities. We examined how invasion by Vincetoxicum rossicum, a plant native to Europe, can alter both the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, {{as well as the}} general fungal communities associating with native plant roots in both field and woodland sites in Southern Ontario. In two different sites in the Greater Toronto Area, we took advantage of invasion by V. rossicum and neighbouring uninvaded sites to investigate the fungal communities associating with local plant roots, including goldenrod (Solidago spp.), wild red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), Canada anemone (Anemone canadensis), <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Thalictrum dioicum), and wild ginger (Asarum canadense). Fungi colonizing roots were characterized with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of amplified total fungal (TF) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) ribosomal fragments. We saw a significant effect of the presence of this invader on the diversity of TF phylotypes colonizing native plant roots, and a composition shift of both the TF and AMF community in native roots in both sites. In native communities invaded by V. rossicum, a significant increase in richness and colonization density of TF suggests that invaders such as V. rossicum may be able to influence the composition of soil fungi available to natives, possibly via mechanisms such as increased carbon provision or antibiosis attributable to unique root exudates...|$|E
40|$|Molecular clones {{encoding}} nine consecutive biosynthetic {{enzymes that}} catalyze {{the conversion of}} l-dopa to the protoberberine alkaloid (S) -canadine were isolated from <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Thalictrum flavum ssp glaucum). The predicted proteins showed extensive sequence identity with corresponding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of related benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in other species, such as opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). RNA gel blot hybridization analysis showed that gene transcripts for each enzyme were most abundant in rhizomes but were also detected at lower levels in roots and other organs. In situ RNA hybridization analysis revealed the cell type–specific expression of protoberberine alkaloid biosynthetic genes in roots and rhizomes. In roots, gene transcripts for all nine enzymes were localized to immature endodermis, pericycle, and, in some cases, adjacent cortical cells. In rhizomes, gene transcripts encoding all nine enzymes were restricted to the protoderm of leaf primordia. The localization of biosynthetic gene transcripts was {{in contrast with the}} tissue-specific accumulation of protoberberine alkaloids. In roots, protoberberine alkaloids were restricted to mature endodermal cells upon the initiation of secondary growth and were distributed throughout the pith and cortex in rhizomes. Thus, the cell type–specific localization of protoberberine alkaloid biosynthesis and accumulation are temporally and spatially separated in T. flavum roots and rhizomes, respectively. Despite the close phylogeny between corresponding biosynthetic enzymes, distinct and different cell types are involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in T. flavum and P. somniferum. Our results suggest that the evolution of alkaloid metabolism involves not only the recruitment of new biosynthetic enzymes, but also the migration of established pathways between cell types...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Rust fungi are biotrophic {{basidiomycete}} plant pathogens {{that cause}} major diseases on plants and trees world-wide, affecting agriculture and forestry. Their biotrophic nature precludes many established molecular genetic manipulations and lines of research. The generation of genomic resources for these microbes {{is leading to}} novel insights into biology such as interactions with the hosts and guiding directions for breakthrough research in plant pathology. Results To support gene discovery and gene model verification in the genome of the wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina (Pt), we have generated Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) by sampling several life cycle stages. We focused on several spore stages and isolated haustorial structures from infected wheat, generating 17, 684 ESTs. We produced sequences from both the sexual (pycniospores, aeciospores and teliospores) and asexual (germinated urediniospores) stages of the life cycle. From pycniospores and aeciospores, produced by infecting the alternate host, <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Thalictrum speciosissimum), 4, 869 and 1, 292 reads were generated, respectively. We generated 3, 703 ESTs from teliospores produced on the senescent primary wheat host. Finally, we generated 6, 817 reads from haustoria isolated from infected wheat as well as 1, 003 sequences from germinated urediniospores. Along with 25, 558 previously generated ESTs, we compiled a database of 13, 328 non-redundant sequences (4, 506 singlets and 8, 822 contigs). Fungal genes were predicted using the EST version of the self-training GeneMarkS algorithm. To refine the EST database, we compared EST sequences by BLASTN {{to a set of}} 454 pyrosequencing-generated contigs and Sanger BAC-end sequences derived both from the Pt genome, and to ESTs and genome reads from wheat. A collection of 6, 308 fungal genes was identified and compared to sequences of the cereal rusts, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) and stripe rust, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), and poplar leaf rust Melampsora species, and the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis (Um). While extensive homologies were found, many genes appeared novel and species-specific; over 40 % of genes did not match any known sequence in existing databases. Focusing on spore stages, direct comparison to Um identified potential functional homologs, possibly allowing heterologous functional analysis in that model fungus. Many potentially secreted protein genes were identified by similarity searches against genes and proteins of Pgt and Melampsora spp., revealing apparent orthologs. Conclusions The current set of Pt unigenes contributes to gene discovery in this major cereal pathogen and will be invaluable for gene model verification in the genome sequence. </p...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} palaeoenvironmental {{records in}} Far-Eastern Russia are rare, and the Kamchatka Peninsula {{is among the}} least studied areas of the region. This paper describes a record spanning the last ca. 11, 000 yr, obtained from a bog {{in the southern part}} of Kamchatka. The radiocarbon dated core was analysed for pollen, testate amoebae, charcoal and loss-on-ignition (LOI). The vegetation during the early Holocene was dominated by grasses (Poaceae), birch (Betula) and heath (Ericaceae p. p.). Around 10, 300 cal yr BP there was a substantial change in the vegetation cover to shrub alder (Alnus viridis s. I.) stands with sedges and ferns (Polypodiophyta) as well as herbs such as <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> (Thalictrum) in the understory. In the surroundings of Utka peatlands started to form. The variations in the vegetation cover were most probably caused by climatic changes. At the beginning of sediment accumulation, before 10, 300 cal yr BP, the composition of the vegetation points to cooler summers and/or decreased annual precipitation. Around 10, 300 cal yr BP, changes in vegetation occurred due to rising temperatures and/or changed water regimes. Increased abundancies of dry indicating testate amoebae after 9100 cal yr BP point to intermediate to dry soil conditions. Between 8600 and 7700 cal yr BP tree alder (Alnus incana) was widely spread at the site which probably indicates optimal environmental conditions. The tephra layer at 381 - 384. 5 cm (ca. 8500 cal yr BP) produces a strong impact on the testate amoebae assemblages. At 7700 cal yr BP there was a sudden drop of A. incana in the local vegetation. From this time on, A. incana and also A. viridis decrease continuously whereas Betula gradually increases. The upper part of the sequence (after 6300 cal yr BP) shows higher abundancies of meadowsweet (Filipendula) and sweet gale (Myrica) pollen. After 6300 cal yr BP, changes in testate amoebae demonstrate variable soil moisture conditions at the site. Between 3700 and 1800 cal yr BP, wet conditions dominate as dry indicating testate amoebae decrease. After 1800 cal yr BP soil conditions become more variable again but this time with dry dominating testate amoebae. In contrast to surrounding regions, there is no evidence of trees such as spruce or larch growing in the surroundings of the site even though those trees are characteristic of many eastern Siberian sites. This difference might be because of the maritime influence of the Okhotsk Sea. Even dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), which is currently widely dispersed in northern Kamchatka, became part of the local vegetation only during the last 700 yr.

40|$|Individuals with birch pollinosis {{may show}} {{allergic}} reactions after consumption of soybean-containing food. This {{is caused by}} cross-reaction of IgE directed against the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 with the structurally homologous allergen Gly m 4 from soybean. Hypersensitivity reactions in birch-soy allergy range from mild reactions to severe systemic reactions. Sera of birch pollen-allergic subjects may contain IgE to Gly m 4, even though no allergy to soy is present. Thus Gly m 4 -specific IgE per se is not a suitable biomarker for birch-related soy allergy. To develop novel approaches for improved diagnosis and therapy of birch-soy allergy, knowledge on epitopes and IgE epitope profile of Gly m 4 for is needed. To date, data on epitopes of Bet v 1 and its homologous allergen Gly m 4 is very limited. 	 In this study, birch pollen-allergic patients with (27 subjects) and without (20 subjects) clinically confirmed allergy to soybean were included and analyzed regarding Gly m 4 -specific serum IgE/IgG levels and epitope profiles of Gly m 4 for IgE. Specific IgE levels against Bet v 1, Gly m 4 and further soy allergens Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 were determined by ImmunoCAP™ and IgE binding to rGly m 4 and soy extract was tested in western blot. To analyze putative IgE epitopes of Gly m 4, non-allergenic Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) from <b>meadow</b> <b>rue</b> {{was used as a}} model protein. NCS is structurally homologous to Gly m 4 but exhibits none to very little binding of Gly m 4 -specific IgE antibodies enabling grafting of Gly m 4 epitopes onto the model protein. Potential candidate residues of Gly m 4 were selected by bioinformatic analysis of antibody-binding phage-displayed peptides and mapping of segments of Gly m 4 primary structure onto the molecular surface of the allergen. As a result a library of recombinant NCS variants with potential IgE binding was generated. In addition, five multiple substitutional variants of rGly m 4 with a total number of 18 amino acid substitutions crucial for IgE binding were generated and analyzed for antibody binding with patients’ sera. Furthermore a misfolded variant of each rBet v 1 a and rGly m 4 was generated and defined molar ratios of folded/misfolded variants were compared in different immunological and physicochemical assays. Gly m 4 -specific median IgE and IgG levels of allergic (IgE: 9. 3 kUA/L, IgG: 8. 1 mgA/L) and non-allergic (IgE: 4. 5 kUA/L, IgG: 8. 3 mgA/L) subjects were comparable. The specific IgE levels did not correlate to the (severity of) clinical phenotypes. 51 candidate residues of Gly m 4 were selected for IgE epitope analysis and 46 potential functional IgE epitopes, single residues within a structural IgE epitope which dominate the energetics of allergen-IgE binding, were identified with IgE binding to ΔNCSN 42 /P 49 variants. The putative functional IgE epitope pattern was individual for each patient and not distinguishable between allergic and non-allergic subjects. Using five rGly m 4 variants parts {{of the results of the}} NCS-based analyses could be confirmed with 18 potential functional IgE epitopes identified. 46 potential functional IgE epitopes clustered into six distinct putative IgE-binding areas on Gly m 4 and eleven NCS variants (ΔNCSN 42 /P 49 _ 1 - 11) presenting parts of these epitope areas were purified, showing a Gly m 4 -type secondary structure according to CD measurements. Densitometric analysis for binding of IgE antibodies was performed via dot blot with sera of the study population but no characteristic IgE epitope pattern could be found. In contrast ΔNCSN 42 /P 49 _ 9 was identified as most suitable marker to distinguish soy allergic from tolerant patients in birch-related soybean allergy with a sensitivity and specificity of 68...|$|E
