40|$|Extract] The {{old adage}} 'mineral {{exploration}} is like finding {{a needle in}} a haystack' recaps the difficulty of finding economic <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> near or beneath the surface. In general, two main approaches can be used to detect the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> near or beneath the ground surface. One employs a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model and the other aims at the identification of a primary halo about a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit.</b> A <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model provides systematic empirical (descriptive) and/or theoretical (genetic) descriptions of the essential geological, geochemical and geophysical features of a type of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> (cf. Cox and Singer, 1986 and Roberts et al., 1988). The primary halo of a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit,</b> as defined originally by Safronov (1936), is ‘an area including rock, surrounding <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> (ore bodies) and enriched elements that make up that deposit’. Thus, descriptions of primary haloes may form part of a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model, but both deposit model and primary halo approaches to mineral exploration are based on studies of primary geochemical characteristics of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> because chemical processes during mineralization are the ones that ultimately bring about metal precipitation or mineral formation. However, a deposit model approach to mineral exploration is apt for identifying 'which haystacks contain a needle' whereas a primary halo approach to mineral exploration is proper for deducing 'where in a needle-bearing haystack is the needle located'...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Mineralization {{involves}} several processes, {{of which}} chemical processes {{are the ones}} that finally result in precipitation of metals or formation of minerals. Thus, geochemistry is an important field in the study of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> Geochemical (e. g. elemental, isotopic, etc.) characterization of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> is important in (i) understanding ore genesis, (ii) <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> classification, (iii) <b>mineral</b> exploration, (iv) extractive metallurgy or mineral processing, and (v) geoenvironmental research.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{show that}} geo-anomalies can be {{delineated}} for <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> prediction according to singularity theories developed to characterize nonlinear mineralization processes. Associating singularity and geo-anomalies {{makes it possible to}} quantitatively study geo-anomalies with modern nonlinear theories and methods. This paper introduces a newly developed singularity analysis of nonlinear mineralization processes and nonlinear methods for characterizing and mapping geo-anomalies for <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> prediction. <b>Mineral</b> <b>deposits,</b> as the products of singular mineralization processes caused by geo-anomalies, can be characterized by means of fractal or multifractal models. It has been shown that singularity can characterize the degree of geo-abnormality, and this has been demonstrated to be useful for mapping anomalies of undiscovered <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> The study of mineralization and <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> from a nonlinear process point of view is a new but promising research direction. This study emphasizes the relationships between geo-anomalies and singularity, including singular processes resulting in singularity and geo-anomalies, the characterization of singularity and geo-anomalies and the identification of geo-anomalies for <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> prediction. The concepts and methods are demonstrated using a case study of Sn <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> prediction in the Gejiu mineral district in Yunnan, China...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Geochemistry is an {{important}} field {{in the study of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> because mineralization involves several processes, of which chemical processes are the ones that finally result in the precipitation of metals or formation of minerals. Studying the geochemical characteristics of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> is, therefore, important in: (a) understanding ore genesis (the usage of term 'ore' here does not necessarily mean a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> that can be exploited at an economic profit); (b) <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> classification; (c) <b>mineral</b> exploration; (d) extractive metallurgy or mineral processing; and (e) geo-environmental studies. Understanding the genesis and classification of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> have traditionally been carried out together (cf. Westra & Keith 1981; Hitzman et al. 2003; Dill 2010). Knowledge of various geological processes relevant to the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> formation provides a conceptual framework for the application of geocomputational technique for generating mineral exploration targets (cf. Bonham-Carter 1994; Porwal & Kreuzer 2010; Carranza 2011 a). Knowledge of ore genesis is important in developing geoenvironmetal models for <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> (Seal & Foley 2002). Cabri (1988) and Clout (2003) have demonstrated the relevance of understanding of the genesis of ore deposits in providing guidance for mineral processing and metal extraction. Thus, of the different fields of application of geochemical characterization of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits,</b> understanding ore genesis is the most important because it provides information that is essential to the other applications...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{different}} crystal structure, calcium carbonate can be mainly divided into three morphology of minerals, calcite, aragonite and vaterite (Wehrmeister et al. 2010). Even though confocal laser reflection achieve the observation {{of the distinction between}} <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> and biofilms, the detailed mineralogy composition of the deposits could not be determined. We developed a combined method of confocal laser scanning microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy to delineate the morphology and identify the composition of the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> The mineralogy of biomineralization products is calcite by spectra analysis of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> with confocal Raman spectroscopy. The spectra of calcite was distinct between aragonite by identifying Raman shift yielded by lattice vibration. The simultaneous obtainment of fluorescence (biomass) images and reflection signal (<b>mineral</b> <b>deposits)</b> makes it realize for a real time, in situ and nondestructive observation on the processes of biomineralization and <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> producing.|$|R

The shape of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> matched the vacancy of biofilms identically.|$|R
