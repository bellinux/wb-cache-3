5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missiles in combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of <b>Mutually</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction</b> by providing each superpower with Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, B-52s {{and other}} US {{strategic}} bombers performed airborne alert patrols under code {{names such as}} Head Start, Chrome Dome, Hard Head, Round Robin, and Giant Lance. Bombers loitered at high altitude near {{the borders of the}} Soviet Union to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of nuclear war. These airborne patrols formed one component of the US's nuclear deterrent, which would act to prevent the breakout of a large-scale war between the US and the Soviet Union under the concept of <b>Mutually</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction.</b>|$|E
5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5000|$|The FoR {{was active}} in the anti-war {{movement}} of the 1930s, and provided considerable practical support for active pacifism during and after the Spanish Civil War. It could be argued that it lost influence when the Second World War came, was won, and was widely perceived as morally justified, especially as the horrors of Nazism became known in the post-war period. Equally, {{it could be argued that}} the questionable morality of the Cold War threat of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> nuclear <b>destruction</b> again vindicated the FoR philosophy. The FoR retained considerable strength in post-second world war British Christianity, and many of its members were active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent members included Donald Soper, a high-profile President of the Methodist Conference of the period and later a member of the House of Lords. With the continuing decline of Christianity in Britain, the FoR has lost influence, although active Christians in the UK are now probably further to the left politically, on average, than they were in the 1930s or 1950s.|$|R

25|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. It further {{demonstrated}} {{the concept of}} <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction,</b> that neither superpower was prepared to use their nuclear weapons, fearing total global destruction via mutual retaliation. The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, the United States {{emerged as}} a global superpower vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the Cold War. In this period of some forty years, the United States {{provided}} foreign military aid and direct involvement in proxy wars against the Soviet Union. It was the principal foreign actor in the Korean War and Vietnam War during this era. Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under a concept of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> with the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Strangelove {{is a black}} comedy by Stanley Kubrick {{about the}} nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union and the {{doctrine}} of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction.</b> Following a bizarre mental breakdown the C.O. of a SAC base orders the B-52 wing operating from his base to attack the Soviet Union. The title character, Dr. Strangelove, is a parody of a composite of Cold War figures, including Wernher von Braun, Henry Kissinger, and Herman Kahn. The secret code Operation DROPKICK, mentioned by George C. Scott's character, may be an oblique reference to Operation Dropshot.|$|E
25|$|The SALT {{agreements}} {{were generally}} {{considered in the}} West as having codified the concept of <b>Mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> (MAD), or deterrence. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union recognized their mutual vulnerability to massive destruction, no matter which state launched nuclear weapons first. A second SALT agreement, SALT II, was signed in June 1979 in Vienna. Among other provisions, it placed an aggregate ceiling on ICBM and SLBM launchers. The second SALT agreement was never ratified by the United States Senate, {{in large part because}} of the breakdown of détente in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, {{the balance}} of power between the Eastern and Western blocs and the fear of global {{destruction}} prevented the further military use of atomic bombs. This fear was even a central part of Cold War strategy, referred to as the doctrine of <b>Mutually</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction.</b> So important was this balance to international political stability that a treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (or ABM treaty), was signed by the U.S. and the USSR in 1972 to curtail the development of defenses against nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles that carry them. This doctrine resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} nuclear weapons, as each side sought to ensure it possessed the firepower to destroy the opposition in all possible scenarios.|$|E

25|$|The {{early warning}} {{provided}} was useless against ICBMs and submarine-launched attacks. These were countered and {{tempered by the}} MAD (<b>Mutually</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction)</b> philosophy. However, the scenario of a coordinated airborne invasion coupled with a limited nuclear strike was the real threat that this line protected against. It did so by providing Distant Early Warning of an inbound aerial invasion force, which would have to appear at the far north hours ahead of any warhead launches {{in order to be}} coordinated well enough to prevent MAD. A number of intermediate stations were decommissioned, since their effectiveness was judged to be less than desired and required. The manned stations were retained to monitor potential Soviet air activities and to allow Canada to assert sovereignty in the Arctic. International law requires a country that claims territory to actively occupy and defend such territory.|$|E
500|$|Having learnt of {{the ongoing}} Cold War and the {{doctrine}} of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> from Stepashin, Skaldak {{plans to use the}} submarine's nuclear missiles to provoke a global thermonuclear war and destroy humanity as revenge for the humans attacking him - under the Martian code humanity as a whole has declared war on the Ice Warrior race by assaulting him. Reaching the bridge, he is able to connect himself to the sub's missile guidance systems and activate the missiles. The Doctor and Clara are attempting to persuade Skaldak to show mercy when the sub is rocked by a tractor beam from above: the Ice Warriors have arrived over the site of the submarine's undersea grounding, and they haul it to the surface. Skaldak is beamed aboard the Ice Warriors' spaceship, though the missile launch system is still active. Showing mercy, Skaldak deactivates the missiles remotely. When the Doctor's sonic screwdriver informs him the TARDIS has reappeared, he informs Clara that it had [...] "relocated" [...] to the South Pole automatically as part of the H.A.D.S. ("Hostile Action Displacement System"), which the Doctor admits he reactivated by accident while fiddling with the controls. As they are at the North Pole, an embarrassed Doctor asks Zhukov for a lift to get the TARDIS before saluting the Ice Warrior ship as it leaves.|$|E
500|$|Vollmer {{unveiled}} Close Castles in June 2014. Players {{start in}} corners of a [...] "grid map" [...] and {{are represented by}} castles. Vollmer explained that the game's name is from castles built too close to one another, starting a <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> scenario. Players can build three structure types out from their castle: towers that fire at incoming enemies (defense), houses that make [...] "loyal subjects" [...] (offense), and markets that make money (economy). The [...] "A" [...] button with a direction constructs a path directing followers to the enemy. Followers capture enemy structures as denoted by a [...] "defense bar" [...] that fills as followers enter the structure and that destroys the structure when filled. Markets are the weakest structure, and two towers can defend against one house. Player turf grows as player structures approach {{the limits of their}} area. Players earn five units of money a second, which increases by five for every market. Polygon called the game's simple visual design [...] "horrifyingly deceptive". Vollmer has said that games should last around three minutes apiece and that the local multiplayer's lack of [...] "hidden information" [...] should make interactions with other players less of a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] game of waiting for an opponent to concede. The game was demoed on an Xbox 360 but was planned for release on the PlayStation 4. Vollmer put the project on hold while he worked out [...] "fundamental flaws" [...] in the gameplay.|$|E

[...] It is no easy matter to fully segregate peaceful uses of nuclear technology from military or terrorist uses (such as the fabrication of dirty bombs from radioactive waste), which complicated {{the development of a}} global nuclear-power export industry right from the outset.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{development}} of more rapid-response technologies (such as rockets and long-range bombers), this policy began to shift. If the Soviet Union also had nuclear weapons and a policy of [...] "massive retaliation" [...] was carried out, it was reasoned, then any Soviet forces not killed in the initial attack, or launched while the attack was ongoing, would be able to serve their own form of nuclear retaliation against the U.S. Recognizing that this was an undesirable outcome, military officers and game theorists at the RAND think tank developed a nuclear warfare strategy that was eventually called <b>Mutually</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction</b> (MAD).|$|E
2500|$|Although less {{powerful}} than Germany, Imperial Japan is {{a nuclear power}} keeping the Reich at bay with the implicit threat of <b>mutually</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction.</b> Moreover, Japan has its own subordinate rulers (only the Emperor of Manchukuo is mentioned) by the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Despite having [...] "an ocean of slave labor" [...] at its disposal, Japan now concentrates upon developing high technologies. Despite the Germano–Nipponese alliance, the Nazis consider the Japanese racially inferior and lacking in creativity, with propaganda pointing to a perceived decrease in Japan's technological advances as proof of this. Even so, Japanese tourists, students, and restaurants are common within the Reich.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1949 the Soviets tested {{their first}} nuclear weapon, thereby {{escalating}} {{the risk of}} warfare.

The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with Sputnik, the first Earth satellite, began the Space Race, won by the Americans as Apollo 11 landed astronauts on the moon in 1969. The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to large-scale federal support for science education and research.|$|E
