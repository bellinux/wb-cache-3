2500|$|The cill, also spelled sill, is {{a narrow}} {{horizontal}} ledge protruding a short {{way into the}} chamber from below the upper gates. Allowing {{the rear of the}} boat to [...] "hang" [...] on the cill is the main danger one is warned to guard against when descending a lock, and the position of the forward edge of the cill is usually marked on the lock side by a white line. The edge of the cill is usually curved, protruding less in the center than at the edges. In some locks, there is a piece of oak about [...] thick which protects the solid part of the lock cill. On the Oxford Canal it is called a Babbie; on the Grand Union Canal it {{is referred to as the}} cill Bumper. Some canal operation authorities, primarily in the United States and Canada, call the ledge a <b>miter</b> <b>sill</b> (mitre sill in Canada).|$|E

[...] Pilings had been driven on the shore end of the permanent dam, {{as well as for}} the revetment to protect the riverbank from erosion above and below the dam. [...] The river was routed through the lock so that work on the permanent dam could be completed.|$|R
