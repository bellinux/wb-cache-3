50|$|The series {{frequently}} depicted life as unjust, {{with bad}} things happening to good people, such as Flora's death from a brain tumour, Greg's {{fall from the}} roof of the Grove which left him paralysed from the waist down, Jemma Dobson being electrocuted by a faulty electricity <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> and youth leader Geoff Keegan's death in an accidental gas explosion.|$|E
50|$|The Osborne 1 was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} portable microcomputer, released on April 3, 1981, by Osborne Computer Corporation. It weighed 10.7 kg (24.5 lb), cost $1,795 US, and ran the CP/M 2.2 operating system. Powered directly from a <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> as it had no on-board battery, it was still classed as a portable device since it could be packed away and transported by hand to another location.|$|E
30|$|Our idea is {{to develop}} a {{low-power}} wireless system for energy consumption analysis at <b>mains</b> <b>sockets,</b> which can be installed into every household or office. By providing traceability of power consumption for every load in a household, it is possible to give end consumers the opportunity to see, understand, and thereby optimize their own energy consumption behavior. As such, we developed a system to measure energy consumption directly at <b>mains</b> power <b>sockets</b> and transfer the data to a server were it can be viewed and analyzed by the end user. The systems back-end and infrastructure shall also serve as a platform for other smart home metering and home automation devices, presenting a variety of possible applications.|$|R
50|$|Class 171s have mainly standard-class seating plus either nine {{first-class}} {{seats on}} a two-car or 18 on a four-car; all first-class seats are reclining and have <b>mains</b> power <b>sockets</b> {{adjacent to the}} seats.|$|R
30|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} and reducing energy wastage is an important topic of our time. But it is quite difficult {{to figure out how}} much of our total electricity bill can be mapped to which device or at what time the device used it. We believe {{energy efficiency}} of normal households can be improved, if this kind of transparency would be available. In this article, we present a system for energy measurement at <b>mains</b> <b>sockets</b> to gain a transparent view of energy consumption for each device in a household. It consists of several smart energy measuring devices (SEMDs) that use a low-power radio protocol to dynamically build and connect to a radio network to transfer power usage date to a server. At the server, the data is stored and can be accessed via web interface.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the system}} had one channel that was {{transmitted}} as direct audio. The wires and plugs {{for the system}} {{were the same as}} for standard power wires and plugs which could cause receivers to burn out by attaching to <b>mains</b> <b>socket.</b> During World War II, all RF receivers were confiscated , but cable radio continued operating and, in particular, was used to transmit warnings of aerial bombing. The 1960s saw an enhancement with the addition of two additional channels, using AM on carrier frequencies of 78 and 120 kHz. The installation of this system became mandatory for all new buildings. The system, along with usual broadcasting, was created to inform people of emergencies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> mounted transformer/rectifier {{provided}} 9V DC to {{the speed}} controller board, which used tachometer feedback from the DC motor to regulate its speed. A small brass pulley drove the platter assembly using a flat rubber belt wrapped around a recessed face machined into {{the underside of the}} one-piece acrylic platter, another unconventional material chosen for its vibration dissipation qualities. The thrust element of the bearing was formed by a tungsten carbide sphere mounted in the bearing spindle pressing against a synthetic ruby cup in top of the aluminium support sleeve for the platter. The bearing was positioned close to the centre of gravity of the platter with side load being carried by a lower PTFE sleeve against the bearing spindle. The next product, referred to as the PT1, is often mistakenly assumed to be their first product. The PT1 was an easier to manufacture version of the 'Original' having the glass top plate replaced by a black painted steel plate. Later versions of the PT1 moved the motor from its original 'one o'clock' position to 'seven o'clock', {{on the opposite side of}} the spindle to the tonearm to mounted it on the top plate. This turntable was in production from 1979 until 1985.|$|E
50|$|This section {{describes}} a work session on this computer, at one typical installation in 1975. The programmer might arrive, {{to work on}} a Fortran-II program that he had already started writing in the previous session, carrying a teleprinter paper listing of that program that has been annotated with the new changes that are to be made, and the punch tape that contains the machine-readable source code of the program. He would first need to turn on the computer at the switch on the conventional <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> on the wall, and then at the front-panel on/off switch. Since the magnetic core memory, which is non-volatile memory, would generally still contain the previous user's program, the programmer might need to load the punched tape called Minisystem (containing the object code of a small, memory monitor program). This tape, which was stored in a small cardboard box on a shelf near the computer, would be entered from the left of the tape-reader. The tape-reader {{was an integral part of}} the front panel of the computer, and would spill out the tape that it had read, on to the floor, on the right-hand side. Once read, the Minisystem could be started by flicking the Run switch on the front panel.|$|E

50|$|The FAB {{series of}} guitar effect pedals is a budget range of pedals {{made by the}} Danelectro company that are {{manufactured}} in China. The series was launched in 2005 {{with the release of}} the FAB Distortion, FAB Overdrive and the FAB Metal pedals. Currently, eight pedals share the same distinctive injection moulded plastic casing and blue LED light. Each has a <b>mains</b> power DC9 <b>socket,</b> or can be powered by a 9 volt battery.|$|R
50|$|In February 1937, they {{produced}} what they claimed {{was the first}} all-electric mobile fish-and-chips saloon. Beneath a serving counter was an oven, which was fitted with two sets of electric elements. One set could be plugged into a <b>mains</b> electrical <b>socket,</b> and was used to bring the oven up to temperature. Once it was hot, the second set were powered from the vehicle's battery, but the amount of current drawn was somewhat lower, as it only had to maintain the temperature. Two months later, they showcased a mobile milk bar, complete with egg-whisking machines, fountains and a refrigerator, again powered from the vehicle battery. A milk tank held 16 to 20 imp gal of milk. Later in the year they held a competition for ideas to improve or develop their products. Prizes of 10, 5 and 3 guineas were offered.|$|R
40|$|A 10 kJ {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) modulator {{with energy}} recovery {{based on two}} resonant power modules, each containing a 4. 5 kV/ 30 -kA silicon controlled rectifier, a 1. 11 -mF capacitor bank and an energy recovery circuit, working in parallel to allow a maximum actuator discharge current amplitude and rate of 50 kA and 2 kA/mu s was successfully developed and tested. It can be plugged in standard single phase 230 V/ 16 A <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> and the circuit is able to recover up to 32 % of its initial energy, reducing the charging time of conventional EMF systems by up to 68 %...|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{standards}} {{based on two}} round pins with centres spaced at 19mm are in use in continental Europe and elsewhere, {{most of these are}} listed in IEC/TR 60083 Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. There is no European Union regulation of domestic <b>mains</b> plugs and <b>sockets,</b> the Low Voltage Directive specifically excludes domestic plugs and sockets. EU countries each have their own regulations and national standards, for example some require child-resistant shutters, others do not. CE marking is neither applicable nor permitted on plugs and sockets.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60906-1 is an {{international}} standard for 230 V AC domestic power plugs and sockets. It was conceived as a common <b>mains</b> plug and <b>socket</b> standard for use in territories with 230 V mains. The standard was originally published by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1986; the current edition is ed2.0 published in 2009. Although it looks similar to the Swiss SEV 1011 plug, its dimensions are different. As of July 2014, only South Africa has introduced a standard (SANS 164-2) based closely on IEC 60906-1. Brazil used it {{as the basis for}} its NBR 14136 standard, but this is not compatible with IEC 60906-1.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} common to British <b>mains</b> plugs and <b>sockets</b> intended for domestic use. [...] The brass pins appear relatively solid and large compared to others. British Standards for plugs (with {{the exception of}} BS4573) have always specified side entry flex (entry in other types is usually parallel to the axes of the pins). [...] Since 1934, the contacts of a socket have been specified {{in terms of the}} pins of the plug, rather than by specifying the contact dimensions. [...] The pins of both round pin and rectangular pin plugs are arranged in a triangular fashion, the earth pin being the larger and longer pin at the apex. Earthed sockets are designed to be incompatible with two-pin plugs. [...] Both BS546 and BS1363 sockets, when viewed from the front with the earth uppermost, have the line aperture at the lower right.|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluated}} and reverse engineered {{some of the}} commercially available smart home power metering devices [13 – 15] (see Section 2) and derived the following requirements for our platform: Building the measuring devices as adapters for <b>mains</b> power <b>sockets</b> with wireless communication is required {{to make the system}} easy to install without any technical requirements. This enables the user to meter energy consumption of any cable supplied device without further infrastructure requirements. Since our system shall utilize even small energy savings, it is required that the measuring device’s power consumption is low. Otherwise, the potentially high number of measuring devices will consume more energy than generate savings. Also, the system must be cheap, so that user investment can quickly repay itself [5]. Power consumption of the analyzed system’s metering devices varied in a range of 0.3 – 2.0 W per device, which seems to be relatively high. These values reflected our expectations about the energy efficiency of the respective system’s chosen radio communication technology. Therefore, our system uses an energy-optimized radio protocol to reduce energy consumption. Our system shall also be designed to be usable without any technical knowledge. This requires the measuring devices to autonomously build a communication grid and integrate all measuring devices, so that measured data can be transferred to a storage server without difficult setup procedures. For communication with a decentralized server, the system requires an IP gateway. Further, user data is a matter of privacy. All communicated and stored data must be secured using state-of-the-art encryption methods [16]. For the front-end, the data must be pre-{{evaluated and}} presented in a simple and understandable way. This is required to enable a wide-range use, even for users without higher knowledge of electric principals.|$|R
30|$|The {{final result}} of our {{research}} was a fully operational prototype for energy consumption analysis at <b>mains</b> power <b>sockets</b> with low-power radio communication in the 868 -MHz band. Still, {{there is plenty of}} work left. Theoretical analysis of the protocol shows very low energy consumption. In comparison to the state-of-the-art analysis in Section 2, it shows that the device can be significantly more energy efficient. With state-of-the-art devices requiring about 0.3 – 2 W per device, our prototype shows an improvement of factor 10. Still, further improvements in terms of energy efficiency and bandwidth can be made. All power consumption analyses have been made mathematically using values from the data sheets and must be backed with real measured values. The protocol is not yet fully implemented. For the prototype, we reduced the protocol to single-hop, but the protocol was designed to be multi-hop. With more measuring devices, extending the protocol to multi-hop would enable significantly increased setup range for the SEMDs. Bi-directional communication is supported by the protocol to send control commands to the measuring devices for remote control. In {{the current state of the}} work, these commands are not evaluated by the client. In terms of measurement, the current hardware seems to be too expensive and has high power consumption. To fulfill our goal of a low-priced, low-powered power measuring system, different measuring hardware solutions must be used. Measurement without galvanic separation as explained beforehand might be an alternative and must be evaluated. The developed system provides a base technology for our metering platform and enables numerous smart home metering applications. Currently, users can only view their data via a web interface. Developing advanced web-views/interfaces, smart phone applications, or other services built on top of this platform is possible but still an open topic. As an example, a service could automatically evaluate energy consumption of distinct devices and compare it with an internal table of energy consumption values or use the data for other users for comparison. By this, the service could recommend a replacement device with higher energy efficiency and deliver a calculation of return on investment, using the metered data of the old and new device. Additionally, all data could be anonymized and used in other researches and studies since the system provides high-resolution data of energy load in common households. Another topic is to developing web-views that present the metered data to the user, especially since the users might not have any background knowledge about electronic principals. The data presentation must enable the user to understand their energy consumption behavior and show ways to improve. This might require further research in terms of acceptance and usability by the user.|$|R
