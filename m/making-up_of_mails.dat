30|$|When {{breaking}} up the cars of each train should be directed to the classification track {{in accordance with their}} purpose for the subsequent <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> new trains. If in the process of rolling down of cars to different tracks of classification yard, the time intervals between them are not long enough for switching of points, some of the cars will be misrouted. As a result, {{there is a need to}} re-hump the cars, which leads to economic losses associated with additional operation of shunting locomotives and increase in the idle time of cars at the yard. In addition, accidental change of destination track of cars can lead to their over-speed coupling with the cars standing at the track, as a result, damaging the cars and cargoes. Therefore, providing time intervals between the cars necessary to prepare the routes for their rolling down to the desired destinations is an important task. Solution of this task will make it possible to reduce the cost <b>of</b> breaking- and <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> trains at the yards and improve the safety of the humping process.|$|R
30|$|Sorting humps are {{the main}} {{technical}} means providing the breaking- and <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> freight trains. Efficiency of their operation impacts largely on both the cost price {{and the safety of}} freight traffic on the railways. Automation of sorting process by implementing microprocessor control systems is the main direction of increasing hump yard capacity, enhancing safety in trains breaking-up, and improving working conditions on hump yards. However, the high complexity and cost of such systems limits their use on the railways. Therefore, the search for ways to improve microprocessor control systems for sorting humps, aimed at reducing their cost, is a crucial task.|$|R
5000|$|Thornton-Cleveleys (originally simply-named Cleveleys) was a small-sized {{railway station}} which served the two English Lancashire towns of Thornton and Cleveleys, but was {{situated}} in the centre of Thornton. Located on the now disused line between [...] and , the station also had a shunting yard for the <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> freight trains for [...] and beyond. During its life it was also known at times as Thornton station and Thornton for Cleveleys station. In the 1860s and early 1870s the line was of great importance being the direct route from London to Glasgow. Before the Shap route was opened, passengers (allegedly including Queen Victoria) would travel from Euston to Fleetwood and then onwards via steamer to Scotland.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{staining}} mucin is described. The stain used is alcian blue 8 GS The method is rapid and easy in application. The results {{are clear and}} permanent. I disadvantages of most staining methods employed for the demon-X stration of mucin in histological sections of animal tissues are as follows: 1. Doubtful specificity. Not only mucins accept the stain; other elements such as nuclei, connective tissues, &c, may do so as well. 2. Loss of stain. In some cases where mucin is stained in a specific manner by dilution of the stain used, by adjustment of the pH of the stain solution, or by metachromatic properties of the stain, it is frequently difficult or impossible to dehydrate, clear, and mount the section without either immediate or later loss of the stain. 3. The stained mucin may have other stains added to it during additional operations. 4. The staining methods may be involved or may require the <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> reagents which are often unstable...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
