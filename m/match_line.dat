40|$|A novel {{low power}} ripple-precharge Ternary CAM (RP-TCAM) {{architecture}} is proposed for applications in longest prefix matching tasks. The main motivation behind {{this research is}} to reduce the dynamic power consumption in TCAM due to frequent charging and discharging of the highly capacitive <b>match</b> <b>line.</b> This issue is addressed by exploiting the fact that when we compare only the first four bits of incoming packet’s destination address we can identify up to 80 % mismatches in the forwarding table. A selective precharge scheme was devised exploiting the above fact wherein the <b>match</b> <b>line</b> is charged only when there is an exact match in the first four bits of TCAM word, thereby significantly reducing the number of transitions in the <b>match</b> <b>line.</b> The parasitics for simulation were extracted from the layout implemented for a 64 ¢ 32 RP-TCAM architectur...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the accuracy of field matching in patients treated by irradiation of the breast and adjacent lymph nodes. Field matching is performed by the radiographers during each session on a <b>match</b> <b>line</b> drawn on the patient's skin. Field edge positions were assessed in the cranial match plane of tangential breast fields and supraclavicular-axillary fields using an electronic portal imaging device and <b>match</b> <b>line</b> markers placed on the skin of the patients. The mean gap/overlap of the four fields for individual patients during each treatment session, derived from 374 marker projections, was + 0. 5 mm indicating that no systematic gap or overlap was observed. The uncertainty in the position of the four fields with respect to the match plane ranges from 3. 1 to 5. 1 mm (1 SD) for the individual patients. Gaps and overlaps between fields were also related to an absolute <b>match</b> <b>line</b> position, found by comparison of simulator and portal images, showing a small systematic uncertainty of 2. 4 mm and a standard deviation of 3. 3 mm. It can be concluded that the use of an electronic portal imaging device in combination with <b>match</b> <b>line</b> markers is a good method to quantify the accuracy of field matching in vivo.

40|$|Content-addressable memory (CAM) is a {{hardware}} table that can compare the search data {{with all the}} stored data in parallel. Due to the parallel comparison feature where {{a large amount of}} transistors are active on each lookup, however, the power consumption of CAM is usually considerable. This paper presents a hybrid-type CAM design which aims to combine the performance advantage of the NOR-type CAM with the power efficiency of the NAND-type CAM. In our design, a CAM word is divided into two segments, and then all the CAM cells are decoupled from the <b>match</b> <b>line.</b> By minimizing both the <b>match</b> <b>line</b> capacitances and switching activities, our design can largely reduce the power consumption of CAM. The experimental results show that the hybrid-type CAM can reduce the search energy consumption by roughly 89 % compared to the traditional NOR-type CAM.

We propose to use this technique along with pipelining of search operation in which the MLs are broken into several segments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for extracting straight lines from intensity mages and describes a <b>line</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm for solving the line correspondence problem. The line extraction process begins by detecting edges in the intensity image. Next, line support regions are formed where image points (pixels) have similar gradient orientation. A line fitting algorithm is {{then used to}} fit a line to the points in the line support region based on a least means square fitting algorithm. Finally, line segments are linked together to form the final lines by using an adaptive line linking method; this results in much stronger lines and a smaller set of lines to be considered. Once the lines are detected in a sequence of images, a <b>line</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm is used to <b>match</b> <b>lines</b> in one image to the lines in the other image.
