As an important concept in positive education, growth mindset refers to core assumptions about the malleability of a person’s intellectual abilities. The present study investigates the relation of growth mindsets to psychological well-being and school engagement. The study also explores the mediating function of resilience in this relation. We recruited a total of 1260 (658 males and 602 females) Chinese students from five diversified primary and middle schools. Results from the structural equation model (SEM) show that the development of high levels of growth mindsets in students predicts higher psychological well-being and school engagement through the enhancement of resilience.

The proposed model takes into account the characteristic features of <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> of technical universities and faculties, and it constitutes a matrix with a binary opposition. Filled-in matrix cells represent a structure of the language knowledge content in a visual form. Knowledge of the system organization of a language helps the students to understand "language in action" in the way that corresponds to their left hemisphere mindset.

A complex linking of lingvo-didactic components makes the teachers of foreign language take into consideration the results of the research in the field of functional interhemispheric asymmetry of the brain. The emphasis on the abilities of the left hemisphere dominating among the students has to change the approach of the teachers of foreign languages to the organization of the linguistic educational process in a technical university.

Four research questions were formulated to guide the study. A survey design was adopted and simple random sampling technique was used to select 480 lecturers from a population of 4, 389 academic staff from four universities. The instrument for data collection was a 4 -point Likert scale developed by the researchers and titled “Lecturers’ perception of Entrepreneurship Education for Graduate Self–employment Questionnaire (LPEEGSQ) ”. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was 0. 72, using test re-test reliability method. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The result of the study showed that lecturers were positive in their perception of the relevance of entrepreneurship education as an empowerment strategy for graduate self-employment. Male and female lecturers did not differ significantly in their rating of the relevance of entrepreneurship education to graduate self-employment. Lecturers rated information skill as the most important skill students should acquire in their preparation for entrepreneurship, followed by financial management skill and risk taking skill.

40|$|Abstract of the DissertationMindset Matters: Supporting Student Persistence Through The Developmental Mathematics PipelinebyTracey Nicole KiserDoctor of Education in Teaching and LearningUniversity of California, San Diego, 2016 Christopher P. Halter, ChairDevelopmental {{mathematics}} {{is one of}} the most challenging leaks in the mathematics K- 20 pipeline. Few students enter two-year colleges prepared to successfully engage in college-level mathematics classes. Many of students who place into developmental mathematics are low-income, underprepared, students of color, and many are not equipped with the necessary resources to help them persist through college Math placement predicts college success, and being placed into developmental mathematics makes it less possible for students to not only transfer from a community college to a university, but also graduate. Students who place into developmental mathematics can spend most of their community college experience relearning and building on skills they should have mastered in high school. This study investigated developmental mathematics, strategies for maximizing students’ success in developmental math classes, and the interactions between students’ social and physical environments that mediate their thinking and understanding of developmental mathematics. As a result, multiple methods of data sources (survey, field note observations, focus group interviews, and semi-structured interviews) were used to better understand students and teachers’ characterizations of accelerated developmental mathematics. 	The overarching finding in this study was that the <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> matter. Mindsets determine students’ decision-making and their motivation as a result of past math experiences. Consequently, students enter college with a lack of confidence in their ability to succeed in developmental mathematics, which affects their ability to transfer to a university and obtain a degree. While students past math experiences did not make them feel like they could grow mathematically, their personal lives motivated them to develop and grow as a whole individual. In-class practice and tutoring support were also instrumental to student success in developmental mathematics. This research study contributed knowledge about students’ learning needs, faculty perceptions of the students’ learning needs, the ways their instructional practices address students’ learning needs by using their voices to shed light on effective strategies for maximizing students’ success in developmental math classes...|$|E
40|$|There is {{widespread}} current interest in language learning studies regarding {{the extent to}} which student beliefs can influence the language learning process.   Whilst institutions may set up frameworks to enable students to learn languages successfully, many researchers contend that ultimately it is the belief systems <b>of</b> the <b>students</b> themselves which will contribute most to the final outcome of the teaching process. This article explores the idea that the language learning process among students is substantially influenced by their beliefs about this process. A questionnaire based on Horwitz’s (1987) BALLI instrument was used to assess students’ beliefs in terms of language learning, and the issues are discussed within the categories of aptitude, motivation, learning and communication strategies, the nature of learning, and the difficulty of language learning. The results indicate that the beliefs <b>of</b> the <b>students</b> can have a negative influence on their learning strategies which, in turn, affect the success or otherwise of the language learning process.

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the <b>mindsets</b> <b>of</b> gifted <b>students</b> and their non-gifted high ability peers and relate them to the goals they pursue in school. Finally it is questioned whether they can be manipulated by educational interventions. In the current study 246 gifted and non-gifted {{secondary school students}} participate. Two self-report questionnaires are employed to measure their mindset and goal orientation. Results show a statistically significant difference in mindset. Gifted students’ scores on mindset are lower than those <b>of</b> non-gifted <b>students,</b> indicating a fixed mindset. A statistically significant relation between mindsets and goal orientations is not found within the gifted sample. In the non-gifted sample positive statistically significant correlations are found between mindset and approach goal orientation (mastery and performance).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a number}} of commonly used theories and constructs applied to {{the investigation of the}} entrepreneur (at the individual level). For each of these theories, an existing measure is selected and assessed on its applicability to the study of entrepreneurship education, reflecting on past research and an empirical investigation in the entrepreneurship education context. Focusing on trait theory, self-efficacy, intentionality and passion, a measure for each construct was investigated by administering it on a sample of students (n= 367) taking an entrepreneurship education module. Aspects of the reliability, validity, internal consistency and factor structure of each test were examined using SPSS and MPlus statistical analyses. The findings allow for a direct comparison to be made of the measures in a controlled environment. Theoretically there is a justification for applying each assessment approach to entrepreneurship education. Based on past research it was noted that trait theory has often been criticised for inconsistent empirical findings. This was echoed in our study as empirical analysis supported the use of the entrepreneurial intentionality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy measures, yet the trait measure, the General Enterprise Tendency (GET) test displayed worrisome reliability and structural validities and would not be recommended for future research without significant revision. The measure used to examine entrepreneurial passion was stable in the context, and furthermore suggested that this construct may offer valuable insight about the <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> undertaking entrepreneurship education in future. Limitations of the study include use of a mainly homogenous sample with no control group. The measures for analysis were selected as they were intended for entrepreneurship research and have since been applied to entrepreneurship education. The measures are not reflective of respective theory as a whole. Different and many theories could have been selected, as well as alternative measurement instruments. The measures could have been integrated together into a more complex analysis, however the intended purpose was to examine them in parallel. There have been repeated calls to systematise the assessment of entrepreneurship education, to converge existing knowledge and research. It is hoped that this paper provides educators with an overview and empirical insight regarding theories and measures to adopt for future research and assessment approaches. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} shows that students with a growth mindset are more motivated to learn, want to work harder, are less discouraged by difficulty, use more effective strategies for learning, and have higher academic performance in comparison to students without this mindset. Despite these promising findings, a growth mindset is sometimes not reinforced or is even refuted by classroom conditions. The purpose of this intrinsic case {{study was to explore}} how community college educators create classroom environments that foster a growth mindset. The conceptual framework for this study was a social constructivist approach where the interviewer and the participants co-constructed the interpretation of how to influence a growth mindset in the community college classroom. Data were collected through 14 in-depth interviews with community college educators who completed a workshop on influencing a growth mindset. Data were analyzed through categorizing, coding, and identifying themes that answered the research question. The findings of this study indicated that the <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> the <b>student</b> and the teacher {{play an important role in}} academic success at the community college and that faculty desire training in tools and strategies to create classroom environments that foster a growth mindset. Recommendations include an in-depth, experiential professional development program based on research where community college educators from a variety of disciplines can collaborate to gain new knowledge and skills. Training community college educators using the most effective ways of fostering a growth mindset to increase students 2 ̆ 7 motivation, effort, and persistence will lead to greater academic success and degree completion...|$|R

40|$|During Robert E. Kennedy’s {{presidency}} at Cal Poly from 1967 to 1979, Cal Poly experienced many protests {{on several}} different topics, but all ended peacefully, without incident. I argue this is largely because <b>of</b> the peaceful <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> the <b>student</b> body, faculty, and administration {{to keep the}} peace, making Cal Poly a more conservative campus compared to other California Universities, such as the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University. For students, such as those involved in SNAP, violence was not {{a means to an}} end and one of their key goals was to educate rather than yell at others. They believed in Cal Poly’s “Learn By Doing” motto and chose to actually enact it by protesting, but also allowing open discussions about political issues and allowing people with dissenting opinions to voice their opinions without fear of persecution or the threat of harm. The faculty were also very concerned with the issues that were brought up and became involved in protests and held debates in which they had faculty with opposing viewpoints in open discussions, setting an example for their students. The administration also played a huge role in keeping the peace on campus by showing students that their dissatisfaction was not unnoticed by the heads of the school. Kennedy would listen to students, even if he had no real answer for them and would show them that although they tended to associate him with “the man,” that he was indeed also human, like them, and that he understood how frustrated they were. He cooperated with them by giving them times and locations to protest, instead of denying them the opportunity to make their viewpoints known...|$|R
