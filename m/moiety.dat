5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose <b>moiety.</b> An adenylate <b>moiety</b> is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid <b>moiety</b> in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) <b>moiety,</b> forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E
5|$|The silicon-directed Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{reaction was}} subsequently {{employed in the}} synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol <b>moiety,</b> so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether.|$|E
5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol <b>moiety</b> is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol <b>moiety</b> can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} sensor device (20) and {{a method for}} determining the presence and/or amount of target <b>moieties</b> (22) in a sample fluid (27), the target <b>moieties</b> (22) being labeled with magnetic or magnetizable objects (23). The sensor device (20) comprises a magnetic field generating means adapted for applying a retention field for retaining the labeled target <b>moieties</b> (22, 23) to the sensor surface (24) during fluid manipulations. Through this the binding between the labeled target <b>moieties</b> (22, 23) and the sensor surface (24) and/or the magnetic particles (23) and the target <b>moieties</b> (22) is substantially not disturbed during these fluid manipulations.

40|$|Molecular {{states of}} terpyridine ligands in supramolecular {{coordination}} assemblies were investigated {{by means of}} scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy conducted at cryogenic temperature. Submolecular-resolved signals manifest that within the molecules, the empty states at the <b>moieties</b> that are {{directly involved in the}} coordination are downshifted, whereas the other <b>moieties</b> are unaffected. Theoretical calculations attribute this localized perturbation to the specific characteristics of the ligand's orbitals; the ligand <b>moieties</b> possess highly localized empty states. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to electronically modify individual <b>moieties</b> of ligands in supramolecular assemblies by metal coordination...|$|R

Only the first compound was significantly inhibitory, suggesting that the presence of the azoxy <b>moiety</b> is required for growth inhibition.|$|E
5|$|In Australian Aboriginal mythology, Crow is a trickster, culture {{hero and}} ancestral being. In the Kulin nation in central Victoria {{he was known}} as Waa (also Wahn or Waang) and was {{regarded}} as one of two <b>moiety</b> ancestors, the other being the more sombre eaglehawk Bunjil. Legends relating to Crow have been observed in various Aboriginal language groups and cultures across Australia.|$|E
30|$|A {{great variety}} of {{surfactants}} occur as metabolites synthesized by various microorganisms. Their structures are versatile and many different hydrophilic and hydrophobic <b>moieties</b> are described in literature (Hausmann and Syldatk 2014; Kügler et al. 2015). Within glycolipids, the hydrophilic <b>moieties</b> usually are composed {{of one or more}} sugar components, mainly present in their ring form. Glucose, sophorose, rhamnose, mannose and the disaccharid trehalose are best studied as hydrophilic <b>moieties</b> of glycolipid biosurfactants. Linked to these are a variety of different lipophilic <b>moieties,</b> largely described are fatty acids of variable length.|$|R

Tight binding band structure calculations indicated {{the existence of a}} Peierls gap due to the tetramerization of the TTF <b>moieties</b> in the one-dimensional stacking column at room temperature, which is consistent with the semiconducting behavior of this salt...|$|R
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose <b>moiety</b> of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|Non-nucleoside phosphoramidites are the phosphoramidite {{reagents}} {{designed to}} introduce various functionalities at the termini of synthetic oligonucleotides or between nucleotide residues {{in the middle}} of the sequence. In order to be introduced inside the sequence, a non-nucleosidic modifier has to possess at least two hydroxy groups, one of which is often protected with the DMT group while the other bears the reactive phosphoramidite <b>moiety.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) <b>moiety</b> to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
50|$|These forms could {{possibly}} allude to the Raven and Wolf/Eagle <b>moieties</b> of the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska, and {{the portrayal of}} both <b>moieties</b> (also known as 'descent groups') through the same character could symbolize Balto and Aleu's mixed heritages.|$|R

40|$|An {{electrostrictive}} graft elastomer has a backbone molecule {{which is}} a non-crystallizable, flexible macromolecular chain and a grafted polymer forming polar graft <b>moieties</b> with backbone molecules. The polar graft <b>moieties</b> have been rotated by an applied electric field, e. g., into substantial polar alignment. The rotation is sustained until the electric field is removed. In another embodiment, {{a process for producing}} strain in an elastomer includes: (a) providing a graft elastomer having a backbone molecule {{which is a}} non-crystallizable, flexible macromolecular chain and a grafted polymer forming polar graft <b>moieties</b> with backbone molecules; and (b) applying an electric field to the graft elastomer to rotate the polar graft <b>moieties,</b> e. g., into substantial polar alignment...|$|R
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD is also {{consumed in}} ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the ADP-ribose <b>moiety</b> of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation involves either {{the addition of}} a single ADP-ribose <b>moiety,</b> in mono-ADP-ribosylation, or the transferral of ADP-ribose to proteins in long branched chains, which is called poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal cell signaling. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is carried out by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. | journal = FEBS J. | volume = 272 | issue = 18 | pages = 4576–89 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16156780 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04864.x }} The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} reagent is a camphor-derived reagent {{developed}} by Varinder Aggarwal of the University of Bristol. Both enantiomers are easily synthesized, although the yields {{are lower than}} for the oxathiane reagent. The ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor <b>moiety.</b> The reaction employs a phosphazene base to promote formation of the ylide.|$|E
5|$|The two {{non-standard}} proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes {{as well as}} most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and pyrrolysine (found only in some archaea and one bacterium). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic <b>moiety</b> in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUseful polyols for rigid {{polyurethane}} foam manufacture {{may be obtained}} by glycolysis of post-consuming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) wastes. The physicochemical properties of about 100 polyesterdiols were measured, the polyol molecular structure being built on three diacidic <b>moieties</b> and three glycolic <b>moieties</b> in various proportions. Viscosity, foaming agent compatibility and storage stability are the most relevant physicochemical properties. Statistical analysis was made over more than 50 polyols. Molar ratios of the constitutive <b>moieties</b> to terephthalic residue were taken as composition parameter. From a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{it was found that}} 141 b compatibility is of opposite viscosity and independent of polyol storage stability, the properties being governed essentially by the glycolic <b>moieties.</b> Multiple regressions gave prediction equations for viscosity and 141 b compatibility as a function of <b>moieties</b> amounts. The own effect of each structural unit was also investigated through some more homogeneous panels of polyols. Lack of storage stability appears when the proportions of constitutive PET units in glycolic and acidic <b>moieties</b> overcome critical values. The viscosity of the polyols. increases greatly with decreasing hydroxyl value or increasing the proportion of aromatic diacidic residues...|$|R

5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide <b>moiety</b> into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide <b>moiety</b> can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate <b>moiety</b> is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester <b>moiety.</b> This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E

Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl <b>moiety</b> include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right.
