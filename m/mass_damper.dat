40|$|International audienceRandom {{uncertainties}} in {{finite element}} models in linear structural dynamics are usually modeled by using parametric models. This means that: (1) the uncertain local parameters occurring in the global <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices of the finite element model have to he identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices have to be constructed. In the low-frequency range, a reduced matrix model can then be constructed using the generalized coordinates associated with the structural modes corresponding to the lowest eigenfrequencies. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing a random uncertainties model of the generalized <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model does not require identifying the uncertain local parameters and consequently, obviates construction of functions that map the domains of uncertain local parameters into the generalized <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model of random uncertainties is based on direct construction of a probabilistic model of the generalized <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices, which uses only the available information constituted of the mean value of the generalized <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices. This paper describes the explicit construction {{of the theory of}} such a nonparametric model...|$|R

25|$|For {{occupant}} comfort, {{the building}} has a tuned <b>mass</b> <b>damper,</b> which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, {{and had to be}} corrected quickly.|$|E
25|$|But {{despite these}} repairs, by 2002 the {{memorial}} still had almost $795,000 in deferred repairs. Some {{of the larger}} and more costly projects which were needed included removal and resetting of the granite front steps, purchase and installation of emergency generators, replacement of the fresh water mains, installation of a tuned <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> to prevent wind damage to the tower, installation of emergency lighting, and a structural survey of the memorial. In 2003, the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry agreed to provide $200,000 to fund the renovation of the George Washington museum. The renovations were {{to be completed by}} August 2003. In February 2004, renovations to the exhibits in the three Shriners' rooms on the first floor were also complete. By fall of that year, the sidewalks {{on the north side of}} the memorial had also been replaced, and in 2005 retaining walls around the Masonic symbol on the east side were built. Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots.

In this paper, in order to investigate the effects of the caisson on the cylinder's hydrodynamic coefficients and exciting forces, the expressions for velocity potentials are derived in the presence of an incident linear wave by use of an eigenfunction expansion approach. A set of theoretical added <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> coefficient and exciting force expressions are obtained.

2500|$|The tuned <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> {{system was}} used by several teams, notably Renault, during {{the latter part of}} 2005 and the 2006 seasons. The devices were located in the nosecone, and were {{particularly}} effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. After the French Grand Prix, the FIA announced that the system would be outlawed. This had a particularly significant effect on Renault, as the team had effectively built their cars around the devices, and had introduced them as long ago as the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. At the German Grand Prix the Renault team submitted one of their cars for scrutineering by the race stewards, who ruled that the devices were acceptable. The FIA launched an appeal against this decision, and on 23 August 2006 the FIA International Court of Appeal issued a statement upholding this appeal and rejecting the stewards' decision. The Court of Appeal stated that the system infringed part of the bodywork section (Article 3.15) of the Formula One Technical Regulations, which stated that any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance had to: comply with the rules relating to bodywork, be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom), and remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car. The central argument was whether the mass dampers function as aerodynamic devices or {{as a part of the}} suspension system. The FIA reasoned that because the devices did not [...] "remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car", they were illegal. But the FIA failed to explain how the damper, which was entirely enclosed with the car can be counted as bodywork when article 1.4 of the regulations defined bodywork as: ...|$|E
