500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, <b>maybe,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|R

I’m sorry you weren’t home, I didn’t think you would be. I planned to call later, but I’m flying again tonight. I’m sorry I haven’t written more this week but this night flying takes up all of the little sack time that I have. You’ve been swell about writing, hon. You have no idea how good it is to come {{crawling}} back from P. T. and find one of your letters on my bed, but did you ever try to read a letter in the shower? Have you got any waterproof ink? I hardly have time to read them, much less write. Yeah, that’s the song “That could happen to them,” er, no;…”It could happen to me,” well anyway I like it. What are you doing these nights that you’re not getting any sleep? Have you tried going to be early, or is it the lack of Ovaltine in your diet? Well <b>maybe</b> this weekend <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> in at a decent hour, (desent – descent, decsent hours) (how the hell do you spell that?), 3 : 30 instead of four. I’m not promising anything now, but Saturday night I’m {{going to try to get}} tickets to a show in N. Y. I’ll see if I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a nice soft pillow for you to sit on. Say, Sunday is the 29 th are we going to that wedding? I’d forgotten all about it. I’d like to go, I love weddings. Well hon, I’ve got to go to some lecture on night flying safety now. I’ll see you Saturday angel. In the meantime, stay sober. [Closing indecipherable][Transcription ends...|$|R

[...] "I'd {{like to know how}} he'd ever get that Spanish girl out of the country now, with all the trails overrun by rebels and raiders. It'd be hard to {{disguise}} her. Say, Dick, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Thorne to stay here. You know, since you've discovered the possibility of a big water supply, I've had dreams of a future for Forlorn River.... If only this war was over! Dick, that's what it is--war--scattered war along the northern border of Mexico from gulf to gulf. What if it isn't our war? We're on the fringe. No, we can't develop Forlorn River until there's peace." ...|$|E

When asked what Angela hopes people listening to Elephant will take away, she said [...] "I’d like for someone to find a part of themselves in it; <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> down into their emotions and make them feel a certain way - not necessarily have them think about who we are while listening to it." ...|$|E
5000|$|APODETI's first {{president}} was Arnaldo dos Reis Araújo, a 60-year-old cattle farmer who had {{collaborated with the}} Japanese invasion forces during World War II. Araujo spent several months in Jakarta during 1974, where he met government officials who quickly found ways to support his organization. Later, {{he became the first}} governor of East Timor under Indonesian rule. The first vice-president of the party was Hermenegildo Martins, owner of a coffee plantation. Another key APODETI leader was a former schoolteacher named José Osorio Soares. Echoing the sentiment that East Timor could not survive as an independent state, he professed a strong faith in Indonesia's willingness to help. In 1975 he said: [...] "We do not need neocolonialism, just some control from Indonesia; and if we need some things <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> them from Indonesia." ...|$|E

5000|$|In July 2015, {{journalist}} Major Garrett {{made headlines}} {{when he asked}} President Obama during a press conference why he was [...] "content" [...] with the Iran Nuclear Deal that left four Americans trapped in Iran, referring to Rezaian and three others (Amir Mirza Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Robert Levinson). Obama admonished Garrett by responding, [...] "I’ve got to give you credit, Major, for how you craft those questions. The notion that I am 'content' as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails, Major, that’s nonsense, and you should know better. Now, if {{the question is why}} we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that creates. Suddenly, Iran realizes, 'You know what? <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|At the 2011 Worlds, Volosozhar/Trankov placed {{third in}} the short program, second in the free skate, and won the silver medal behind 2008-09 champions Aliona Savchenko / Robin Szolkowy and ahead of the {{defending}} champions, Qing Pang / Jian Tong. It was the first World medal for both partners. The pair are one of few in modern times to reach the World podium in their first season together and in their first appearance at a major international event. Media coverage of the event noted their fast development and their potential for the future. Volosozhar said, [...] "We didn't even think about the silver medal (before Worlds). We thought, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the bronze. The result was completely unexpected for us. The most impressive moment of the championships was how enthusiastic the spectators were even before our short program, and I'll never forget how they gave us a standing ovation after the free program." ...|$|E
40|$|We’re all {{aware that}} {{technology}} progresses forward with giant leaps {{on a daily}} basis. In one-way or another this affects us in our everyday life. It can affect us in the way we’re shopping, communicating, researching, planning future events or how we choose to be entertained. That the web is an increasingly stronger tool for communicating in more or less every type of business is becoming more evident for people. For {{the past few months}} I’ve been working at Adamsson Appelfeldt Advertising in designing and developing a highly interactive website for a Swedish furniture company called Ragnars. By being involved in the work process myself, I’ve tried to analyze how I, as an interaction designer, can improve it and make it work smoother for everyone involved. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a more distinct indication on when, where and how problems arise by letting users test the website on a regular basis. In this report you’ll follow me through the design process, how I’ve involved users in the project, and how I have evolved individually as an interaction designer. The help of using interaction design for creative solutions on the web and other areas of development online is definitely something that should be explored further...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project {{is to show that}} there is a direct {{relationship}} between childhood obesity and socioeconomic status. Other factors that go into this relationship include: physical activity and foods available in vending machines. My ultimate objective is to prove that children coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds are showing higher levels of obesity during childhood. I believe that this work, as well as other studies similar to this, can be used show that these children need more help and assistance. Many of these children are not taught proper eating habits; generally because cheaper foods are generally not nutrition and energy dense. Many families living in poorer neighborhoods do not have supermarkets close by, which greatly affects their eating behaviors (Flournoy, 2006). If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the word out that children will make better choices when given the opportunity, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> encourage schools to provide healthier choices to their students...|$|R
