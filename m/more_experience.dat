50|$|In a 2017 {{study on}} American {{university}} students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors' heart rates(Konijin,1993). While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the <b>more</b> <b>experienced</b> actors displayed less {{heart rate variability}} than the less experienced actors in the same play. The <b>more</b> <b>experienced</b> actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less <b>experienced,</b> <b>more</b> stressed actors. The <b>more</b> <b>experienced</b> an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.|$|R

5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town marshal in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. He is often mistakenly {{regarded}} as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal that day, and had far <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.|$|E
5|$|Barrymore {{began to}} contact his family's {{theatrical}} connections {{to find work}} and approached Charles Frohman, {{who had been the}} producer of Captain Jinks and had also been an employer of Barrymore's mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> before making a Broadway debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in Magda, and in November when the troupe produced Leah the Forsaken, he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.|$|E
5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain <b>more</b> <b>experience.</b> So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{was posted}} to No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch on 12 July 1940, {{arriving}} the next day, {{just as the}} Battle of Britain was getting under-way. No. 65 Squadron boasted several aces, including Bill Franklin who had destroyed 10 enemy aircraft. Finucane called him the scruffiest man in the squadron, but was envious of Franklin's skill and was keen to emulate him. Anxious to get <b>more</b> <b>experience,</b> Finucane loitered around dispersal hoping to build up flight time on the Spitfire by asking as many senior officers for as many hours practice as was possible. Finucane was granted a few flights to improve {{his handling of the}} fighter before he was assigned to B Flight or Green Section.|$|E
5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had quite a lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort {{with that of the}} British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E

5|$|Revelations: The Demon Slayer, Last Bible II, and Last Bible III are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} which all have similar gameplay. Players explore the game world and fight {{various types of}} monsters. During battles, players choose commands for their characters to do from a menu. Players can attack with both physical attacks and magic spells; different kinds of magic are effective against different types of monsters. Characters in players' party learn new spells {{throughout the course of}} the game. By defeating monsters, players gain experience points and money. As characters gain <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> points, players get access to points which he or she can add to the characters' attributes; for instance, players can add points to a character's speed attribute, which allows that character to move earlier during battles. Players can use money that they've earned through battles to buy armor, weapons, and items, in shops found throughout the game world.|$|E
5|$|The leader Uruk {{will have}} a range of {{strengths}} and weaknesses, the latter that can be exploited in combat to quickly weaken and defeat the leader. The player can gain knowledge of these through finding intelligence mostly by draining and interrogating marked Uruks for this. Being able to exploit such weaknesses in defeating the leader will gain a better quality rune and <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> points in this manner. Once the player gains the ability to brand Uruks, they can brand these leaders and convert portions of Sauron's army to their side. At this point, the player can use the Nemesis system to trigger infighting within the Uruk forces which they can then directly participate in, helping to weaken the army further. Uruks that survive their encounter with Talion will remember this when Talion combats them again; for example, an Uruk who was thrown into a fire by Talion might want revenge on him for being disfigured.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, {{the scheme}} proved to have {{numerous}} benefits, {{as many of}} these youths went on to serve in the First AIF during World War I and the expanded organisation allowed citizens forces officers <b>more</b> <b>experience</b> in commanding formed bodies of men. However, it was the main factor contributing to the decision to recruit the AIF on the basis of voluntary enlistment. Because the army in 1914 was largely made up of young men aged between 19 and 21 who had been enlisted under this scheme, and due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of the war it was necessary for the Australian government to raise a separate force, outside of the Citizens Forces organisation for service overseas. Regardless, {{it has been estimated that}} up to 50,000 militiamen subsequently enlisted in the First AIF during the war.|$|E
