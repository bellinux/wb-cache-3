Both were 10 meters long, 87+1(T.V. 2E) passengers or 90+1(T.V. 20E) passengers capacity including the driver, 2 doors, and a 75 kW motor; top speed was 40-45 km/h. Last vehicles T.V. 20E were also built with an 85 kW motor, speed increased to 50-55 km/h.

40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{are widely}} used at present in the truck industry. The passive {{controllability}} of the parameters of these suspensions makes them suitable for load adapted suspensions. However, active control of these systems is challenging because of their parameter uncertainties and their highly nonlinear behavior. The ultimate goal {{of this research is}} to develop an active <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system to improve the ride comfort and performance of car suspensions. For this purpose, dimensional analysis was applied to the half car model of the Honda Civic. The conventional suspension of the Honda Civic was replaced by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension.</b> Its scaled half car model was designed and built. The parameters of the air spring were identified by carrying out a series of static experiments and frequency analysis on the physical air spring/load system. The mathematical model was validated by experimental results. Different nonlinear controllers were applied to the mathematical model of a quarter car Honda Civic equipped <b>with</b> an active <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension.</b> The first order sliding mode feedback linearization controller (SMFLC) with parameter estimator offers the best ride comfort and performance. The performance of this controller is further studied on the half car model in the presence of different model uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a multidisciplinary approach of railway <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> modelling: both multibody and pneumatic aspects {{are taken into}} account. The work aims at obtaining a realistic model of the secondary suspension and coupling it with a multibody model of a train. Various components of the pneumatic circuit such as bellows, tanks, pipes and valves are taken into account. The article focuses on the bellow - pipe - tank subsystem for which several modelling approaches are presented and compared. Differences between differential and algebraic models are highlighted, and an application-dependent choice between them is suggested. A complete model of the pneumatic circuit is then obtained and coupled with a multibody model of the train. As a result, the behaviour of a suburban train equipped <b>with</b> a <b>pneumatic</b> secondary <b>suspension</b> is analysed, in particular undesired oscillating motions which affect the comfort. Topological modifications and improvements of the suspension are also investigated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical and experimental research aimed at introducing active control capabilities in the <b>pneumatic</b> secondary <b>suspension</b> of a high speed railway vehicle. The active airspring suspension is used, together with an active lateral suspension, to provide a limited carbody tilt, reducing passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and hence allowing to raise service speed on existing high speed lines. To this aim, a suitable control strategy is defined for the active suspension, based on the combination of open-loop and closed-loop control, and the parameters of the actuation and control system are optimised using simplified models of the actively controlled vehicle. The active suspension concept is then demonstrated by means of laboratory tests performed on a full-scale test stand consisting of one bogie <b>with</b> active <b>pneumatic</b> secondary <b>suspension</b> and of a ballast mass reproducing the inertia of half carbody. The numerical and experimental results obtained show the potential of the proposed active suspension to meet the targets set for the investigation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis exemplifies an {{engineering}} service that validates the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system on customized vehicles. This service is {{important as the}} European Commission mandates that all utility vehicles be equipped with ESC as of November 1, 2014. The specific vehicle is a production utility vehicle that has had its suspension customised <b>with</b> a self-leveling <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension.</b> The validation is performed {{in accordance with the}} international standard UN-ECE R 13 H.

40|$|For several decades, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{have been}} used on most of {{passenger}} trains. This technology has many advantages such as the possibility of controlling the carbody height, the adaptive stiffness with payload, etc. It relies {{on the use of}} air springs but also implies a complete pneumatic circuit composed of auxiliary tanks, pipes and various valves. Consequently, such a complex system requires the development of specific modelling techniques for understanding its dynamic behaviour. Furthermore, as recommended by the UIC 518 standard, the various failure modes that may arise on a train, not only for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension,</b> have to be identified. Regarding this question, the various components of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> can increase the possibility of breakdowns. The goal of this paper is thus to show how we can quantify the consequences of a failure of one element thanks to the developed models, as needed by the rail industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to analyze the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> systems to improve their vibration isolation performance. The work presented in this thesis addresses modeling, analysis {{and control of the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system. First, the static and dynamic characteristics of a generic <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system are studied, followed by the development of a nonlinear model of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system for multiple operating conditions. An air spring- accumulator system has various dynamic nonlinearities which are explored extensively through numerous simulations as well as exhaustive experimental work. One of the main objectives of this work was to better understand the physics behind the operation of air spring-accumulator system, obtain reliable math model, and develop effective control design for such systems. In terms of of the controller design, a control-oriented analytical model is obtained by the system identification techniques. Then, a model reference H-infinity controller design is presented based on the system-id where control input is the modulation of orifice opening using an electronically-controlled proportional solenoid valve. The experimental results show that the closed-loop system with designed controller significantly improved the vibration isolation performance over a wide frequency range. It is shown that the inherent vibration isolation characteristics of air spring-accumulator system can be exploited through careful modeling and advanced control design. The pneumatic system offers a much economical and easy way to maintain low weight isolation system for various applications such as over the road trucks, automobiles, gurneys. etc. Finally, potential enhancements to the system are proposed for future work...|$|R
