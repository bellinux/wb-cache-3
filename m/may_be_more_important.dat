5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for object detection.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time {{a large number}} of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrots, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E

25|$|Although Typha {{are native}} wetland plants, {{they can be}} {{aggressive}} in their competition with other native species. They have been problematic in many regions in North America, from the Great Lakes to the Everglades. Native sedges are displaced and wet meadows shrink, likely {{as a response to}} altered hydrology of the wetlands and increased nutrient levels. An introduced or hybrid species may be contributing to the problem. Control is difficult. The most successful strategy appears to be mowing or burning to remove the aerenchymous stalks, followed by prolonged flooding. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to prevent invasion by preserving water level fluctuations, including periods of drought, and to maintain infertile conditions.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

2500|$|Based on all archeological evidence, {{the design}} of the trireme surely pushed the {{technological}} limits of the ancient world. After gathering the proper timbers and materials it was time to consider the fundamentals of the trireme design.

Linear dynamical systems and systems that have two numbers describing a state are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.|$|E
2500|$|HLA-DQ8 confers {{susceptibility}} to coeliac disease {{but in a}} fashion somewhat similar to DQ2.5. Homozygotes of DQ8, DQ2.5/DQ8 and DQ8/DQ2.2 are higher than expected based on levels in the general population.(see: Understanding DQ haplotypes and DQ isoforms). HLA-DQ8 is generally not as involved in the most severe complications, {{and it does not}} recognize the [...] "33mer" [...] of α-2 gliadin to the same degree as DQ2.5. There are a smaller number of gliadin (prolamin) peptides presented by HLA-DQ8. A few studies have been done on the adaptive immune response for DQ8/DQ2- individuals. DQ8 appears to rely much more on adaptive immunity to the carboxyl half of alpha gliadins. [...] In addition, it appear to react with gamma gliadin to a degree comparable to DQ2.5.

2500|$|Since {{quality is}} likely to vary among patches of habitat, it is {{important}} to consider how a low quality patch might affect a population. [...] In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat. [...] One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. [...] The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population. [...] However, if the excess of individuals produced in the source frequently moves to the sink, the sink population can persist indefinitely. [...] Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat. [...] However, ecological trap theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source patches. [...] Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform conservation decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Emulation {{learning}} and imitative learning {{are two different}} adaptations {{that can only be}} assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object. [...] Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared {{on the basis of these}} results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an evolutionary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments. Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than success at a specific task. [...] Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the [...] "ratchet effect" [...] that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.|$|E

6000|$|I {{made through}} these {{performances}} {{a close friend}} and a discovery that was to influence my life. Todhunter had engaged several professional actors with a little reputation, but had given the chief woman's part to Florence Farr, who had qualities no contemporary professional practice could have increased, the chief man's part to an amateur, Heron Allen, solicitor, fiddler and popular writer on palmistry. Heron Allen and Florence Farr read poetry for their pleasure. While they were upon the stage {{no one else could}} hold an eye or an ear. Their speech was music, the poetry acquired a nobility, a passionate austerity that made it seem akin for certain moments to the great poetry of the world. Heron Allen, who had never spoken in public before except to lecture upon the violin, had the wisdom to reduce his acting to a series of poses, to be the stately shepherd with not more gesture than was needed to [...] "twitch his mantle blue" [...] and to let his grace be foil to Florence Farr's more impassioned delivery. When they closed their mouths, and some other player opened his, breaking up the verse to make it conversational, jerking his body or his arms that he might seem no austere poetical image but very man, I listened in raging hatred. I kept my seat with difficulty, I searched my memory for insulting phrases, I even muttered them to myself that the people about might hear. I had discovered {{for the first time that}} in the performance of all drama that depends for its effect upon beauty of language, poetical culture <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than professional experience.|$|E
60|$|If God be {{a perfect}} Father, then {{there must be a}} {{perpetual}} intercourse of some kind between Him and His children; between Him and that planet, however small, on which He has set His children, that they may be educated into His likeness. If God be perfect justice, the wrong, and consequent misery of the universe, how ever small, must be intolerable to Him. If God be perfect love, there is no sacrifice--remember that great word--which He may not condescend to make, in order to right that wrong, and alleviate that misery. If God be the Father of our spirits, the spiritual welfare of His children <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to Him than the fate of the whole brute matter of the universe. Think not to frighten us with the idols of size and height. God is a Spirit, before whom all material things are equally great, and equally small. Let us think of Him as such, and not merely as a Being of physical power and inventive craft. Let us believe in our Father in heaven. For then that higher intellect,--that pure reason, which dwells not in the heads, but in the hearts of men, will tell them that if they have a Father in heaven, He must be exercising a special providence over the minutest affairs of their lives, by which He is striving to educate them into His likeness; a special providence over the fate of every atom in the universe, by which His laws shall work together for the moral improvement of every creature capable thereof; that not a sparrow can fall to the ground without his knowledge; and that not a hair of their head can be touched, unless suffering is needed for the education of their souls.|$|E
6000|$|I {{should have}} been glad to have said {{a few words about}} the use of museums in the study of Biology, but I see that my time is {{becoming}} short, and I have yet another question to answer. Nevertheless I must, at the risk of wearying you, say a word or two upon the important subject of museums. Without doubt there are no helps to the study of Biology, or rather to some branches of it, which are, or <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than natural history museums; but, in order to take this place in regard to Biology, they must be museums of the future. The museums of the present do not, by any means, do so much for us as they might do. I do not wish to particularise, but I dare say many of you, seeking knowledge, or in the laudable desire to employ a holiday usefully, have visited some great natural history museum. You have walked through {{a quarter of a mile}} of animals, more or less well stuffed, with their long names written out underneath them; and, unless your experience is very different from that of most people, the upshot of it all is that you leave that splendid pile with sore feet, a bad headache, and a general idea that the animal kingdom is a [...] "mighty maze without a plan." [...] I do not think that a museum which brings about this result does all that may be reasonably expected from such an institution. What is needed in a collection of natural history is that it should be made as accessible and as useful as possible, on the one hand to the general public, and on the other to scientific workers. That need is not met by constructing a sort of happy hunting-ground of miles of glass cases; and, under the pretence of exhibiting everything, putting the maximum amount of obstacle in the way of those who wish properly to see anything.|$|E
