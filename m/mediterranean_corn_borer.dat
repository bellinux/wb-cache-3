50|$|Sesamia nonagrioides, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer,</b> Pink {{stalk borer}} or West African pink borer, is a moth of the Noctuidae family.

50|$|The cyc gene {{found in}} the moth Sesamia nonagrioides, or {{commonly}} known as the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer,</b> has been cloned in a recent study; this SnCYC was found to have 667 amino acids. Further structural analysis showed that it also contains a BCTR domain in its C-terminal in addition to the common domains found in Drosophila CYC. Researchers found that the mRNAs of Sncyc expression was rhythmic in long day (16L:8D), constant darkness, and short day (10L:14D) cycles after investigating its expression patterns in larvae brains. Furthermore, it was found that photoperiodic conditions affect the expression patterns and/or amplitudes of this gene. In Sesamia nonagrioides, this Sncyc gene is associated with diapause. This {{is due to the fact}} that under short day (diapause conditions) the photoperiodic signal alters the accumulation of mRNA. However in Drosophila, this gene does not oscillate or change in expression patterns in response to photoperiod, therefore suggesting that this species may be useful in further studying the molecular control of circadian and photoperiodic clocks in insects.|$|E

40|$|European and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borers</b> {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important insect pests of maize (Zea mays L.) in North America and southern Europe, respectively. Cell wall structure and composition were evaluated in pith and rind tissues of resistant and susceptible inbred lines as possible <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> resistance traits. Composition of cell wall polysaccharides, lignin concentration and composition, and cell wall bound forms of hydroxycinnamic acids were measured. As expected, most of the cell wall components were found at higher concentrations in the rind than in the pith tissues, with the exception of galactose and total diferulate esters. Pith of resistant inbred lines had significantly higher concentrations of total cell wall material than susceptible inbred lines, indicating that the thickness of cell walls could be the initial barrier against <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> larvae attack. Higher concentrations of cell wall xylose and 8 -O- 4 -coupled diferulate were found in resistant inbreds.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine if phenolics concentration in maize changes during recurrent selection to improve stalk resistance to the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer.</b> Three cycles of selection [EPS 12 (S) C 0, ESP 12 (S) C 2, and EPS 12 (S) C 3] from the maize synthetic population EPS 12 and test crosses to inbred lines A 639, B 93, and EP 42 were field grown and artificially infested with <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> larvae, and the pith tissues were sampled for biochemical analyses. Two major simple phenolic acids [p-coumaric (p-CA) and trans-ferulic (E-FA) acids] were identified in free and cell-wall fractions, whereas four isomers of diferulic acid (DFA) (8 − 5 ′l, 5 − 5 ′, 8 −o− 4 ′, and 8 − 5 ′ benzofuran form) were present in the cell-wall bound fraction. The selection cycles EPS 12 (S) C 0 and EPS 12 (S) C 3 showed less damage and higher cell wall phenolics concentrations than the cycle EPS 12 (S) C 2.

The latter is potentially problematic because this group includes several important pest species that are usually baregly distinguishable from non-pest species. In this study {{we focus on the}} <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> stalk <b>borer</b> Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre), an important pest of maize with a wide area of distribution that covers most of Africa and extends to the south of Europe and western Asia. According to a recent study, this pest consists of three allopatric populations that were formerly considered as distinct species or subspecies. Here we rely on recent collections of 5470 specimens (sampled in 17 countries and 175 localities) that putatively belong to S. nonagrioides. Integrative taxonomy studies allowed us to unravel the existence of six new species that are closely related to S. nonagrioides and described in this paper. In contrast to S. nonagrioides these new species have more specific ecological preferences, as they are associated with a limited number of plant species and habitats. Dating and population genetic analyses carried out on 100 S. nonagrioides specimens also indicate a more complex population structure than previously thought for S. nonagrioides, which can probably be accounted for by late Cenozoic environmental changes...|$|R

In laboratory validation experiments, four conidial doses of a B. bassiana isolate collected from the People’s Republic of China were applied to European <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> larvae which were then incubated at fluctuating temperatures. Simulation results compared favorably with fungal development and mycosis under laboratory conditions.

Results of survival estimate showed that mortality does not decrease noticeably spreading MCB in currently cold areas where it has never been reported, due to the potential survival already assured by the fraction of diapausing larvae in the roots.

40|$|In maize, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> (MCB), Sesamia nonagrioides Lef, is {{the insect}} pest {{that causes the}} most {{significant}} yield losses in north-western Spain. A S 1 recurrent selection program to improve resistance of EPS 12 against MCB was evaluated previously. In the current study two experiments were conducted to determine if antibiosis and/or structural mechanisms {{were responsible for the}} improvement in resistance in this synthetic. Larval growth or survival of MCB was not significantly affected to consider the presence of antibiotic factors in the pith. Besides, pith puncture resistance, previously reported as a possible resistance trait in single inbred lines, did not show significant differences between cycles of selection. Length of the internode basal ring (LIBR) was the structural character most related to stem resistance improvement to MCB in the current evaluation. There was a high positive correlation between MCB tunnel length and LIBR (P ≤ 0. 01, R 2 = 0. 99). The larvae would enter the plant throughout the internode basal area and, this way, they could avoid the increased thickness or hardness of the remaining rind area. LIBR might be a useful measure in future resistance breeding programs against this borer.

The two QTL detected for MCB resistance were close to other QTL consistently found for European corn borer (ECB, Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner) resistance, indicating mechanisms of resistance common to both pests or gene clusters controlling resistance to different plagues.

In this context, we compared reproductive success traits of four Kenyan strains of C. typhae on a French and a Kenyan populations of its host. Differences were found between the four strains and the two most contrasted ones were studied more thoroughly on the French host population. Parasitoid offspring size was correlated with parasitism success and the expression of bracovirus virulence genes (CrV 1 and Cystatin) in the host larva after parasitism. Hybrids between these two parasitoid strains showed phenotype and gene expression profiles similar to the most successful parental strain, suggesting the involvement of dominant alleles in the reproductive traits. Ovary dissections revealed that the most successful strain injected more eggs in a single host larva than the less successful one, despite an equal initial ovocyte number in ovaries. It can be expected that the amount of viral particles increase with the number of eggs injected. The ability to bypass the resistance of the allopatric host may in consequence be related to the oviposition behaviour (eggs allocation).

To develop commercial inbreds of maize resistant to the MCB for use in Europe, {{it would be useful}} to transfer resistance from tropical germplasm like the subtropical inbred CML 103 to temperate lines. The inbred B 73 was chosen as representative of the Stiff Stock heterotic group, a major heterotic group used in hybrid grown in both North American and Europe. The objectives were to study the architecture of genetic factors for resistance to MCB and to check the feasibility of using marker-assisted selection (MAS) for transferring those genetic factors. [Results] Eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) were declared significant for resistance traits and eight QTL were located for agronomic traits. Alleles from CML 103 at QTL significant for tunnel length could reduce tunnel length made for MCB in inbred B 73 in more than 8 cm; favorable alleles for yield were also found in CML 103 and no genetic correlation coefficient between tunnel length and yield was detected.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of heterosis and the efforts to comprehend this phenomenon, its molecular bases are still unknown. In this study, we intended to detect Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for mid-parent heterosis under infestation with the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> (MCB, Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.) using a North Carolina design III approach with a RIL population derived from a European flint inbred (EP 42) × American dent inbred (A 637) cross. QTL for heterosis of kernel yield have been positioned in regions corresponding to previously identified QTL for the same trait in different backgrounds. These results reinforce the high congruency of genes controlling heterosis across populations, even when populations have been developed from different heterotic patterns. A high percentage of genetic variation for mid-parent heterosis (Z 2) for kernel yield could not be explained. Furthermore, genomic regions involved in heterosis for yield and plant height were not found despite the high genetic correlation between Z 2 transformations for kernel yield and plant height. The moderate power in detecting QTL for mid-parent heterosis suggests that many genes with low augmented dominance effects contribute to the genetic architecture of mid-parent heterosis; dominance and additive-additive epistatic effects could also contribute to heterosis. However, results from this and previous {{studies suggest that the}} region 8. 03 – 8. 05 deserves special attention in future works in order to fine map loci involved in mid-parent heterosis for yield.

The objectives of the current study were 1) to estimate the impact of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>corn</b> <b>borer,</b> Sesamia nonagrioides Lefèbvre, damage on fumonisin contamination in the maize kernel by comparing fumonisin contamination under infestation and protected conditions, and 2) to measure the potential use of genotypes resistant to this borer as controlling factors of fumonisin contamination. Genotypes with increased kernel damage by borers tended to increase fumonisin accumulation under infestation conditions. In particular environments, other factors influenced fumonisin contamination more than damage by borers. When ear damage by borers is significant, maize resistance to ear damage could contribute to the reduction of fumonisin contamination in the kernels. Genotype such as EP 42 × EP 77 that combines low ear damage by borers and low fumonisin level across environments is a good choice to control fumonisin contamination. The use of an applicable methodology to identify Mediterranean corn borer-resistant genotypes to ear attack under artificial infestations might be a promising approach. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.

Like most moths, The Southwestern <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> undergoes complete metamorphosis developing as an egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa and adult. It is capable of entering diapause in its larva stage [...] and under the conditions of a precise photoperiod. Growth and development are regulated by juvenile hormones. The Southwestern <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> has an extensive range. It occurs in Mexico and in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the feasibility of using a combination control program for both broods of European <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> larvae and the two injurious stages of the corn rootworms in Eastern Nebraska. This research program consisted of two approaches. Each approach was designed to test the effectiveness of a combination program for controlling both the European <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> and <b>corn</b> rootworm at specific stages in their life cycles. Early-season experiments were directed at first-brood <b>corn</b> <b>borer</b> and <b>corn</b> rootworm larvae while the late-season experiment was directed toward control of second-brood <b>corn</b> <b>borers</b> and adult <b>corn</b> rootworms. The experiments were composed of field plots located at specific locations in Eastern Nebraska during 1967 and 1968. Analyses were performed on the data and Duncan’s Multiple range test was used for determining significances. Advisor: Roscoe E. Hil...|$|R
