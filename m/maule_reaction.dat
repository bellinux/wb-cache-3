30|$|Using a Tris–HCl buffer {{instead of}} ammonia in the <b>Mäule</b> <b>reaction</b> results in similar color {{development}} as that found using the traditional method. In addition, this new method is resistant to color fading with time. Moreover, evaluation after blue light excitation (around 480  nm) improves {{the observation of}} lignification and lignin distribution, because syringyl lignin emits red fluorescence (around 640  nm) and guaiacyl lignin fluoresces yellow-green (~ 550  nm). Our method provides visual information on the heterogeneous distribution of lignin in hardwoods. The analysis of woody anatomy would be improved using this novel Mäule method.|$|E
30|$|The {{differentiating}} xylem of Japanese cypress and poplar {{were fixed}} in 2.5  % glutaraldehyde and 0.07  M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and 40 -µm-thick transverse sections were prepared. For Wiesner reaction, the sections were incubated with 2  % (w/v) phloroglucinol in 95  % (v/v) ethanol for 1  min, followed by addition of 6  N HCl. For <b>Mäule</b> <b>reaction,</b> sections {{were treated with}} 1  % (w/v) KMnO 4 solution for 5  min. After a brief wash in distilled water, the sections were incubated in 2  N HCl for 5  min, and then washed with distilled water. Sections were mounted onto glass slides and treated with concentrated NH 3 solution.|$|E
30|$|Because {{microscopic}} analysis provides useful {{information on the}} existence and distribution of cell wall components, many methods for microscopic examination {{have been developed to}} detect lignin. Lignin typically absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light; thus, a UV microscope is a powerful tool for its detection [1]. Some chemical reagents can provide information on the existence of lignin. For example, potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) is often used to investigate cell wall lignification by transmission electron microscopy [2]. Staining with acriflavine [3] or safranine [4] can permit the detection of lignin because fluorescent coloration can indicate the concentration ratio of lignin and cellulose. However, these staining methods cannot be used to identify specific structure of lignin. Other methods have been used to detect specific structures in lignin. The Wiesner reaction (phloroglucinol-HCl reaction) can be used to detect O- 4 -linked coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes in lignin [5]. The Mäule color test, which is performed by sequential treatment with potassium permanganate, hydrochloride, and aqueous ammonia, {{is one of the most}} useful methods for detecting lignin. This method produces purple-red emissions with hardwood samples, and has been widely used to distinguish hardwoods from softwoods. Meshituka and Nakano [6 – 8] reported that the purple-red color is due to 3 -methoxy-o-quinone structures generated from syringyl lignin. Iiyama and Pant [9] suggested that β-ether cleavage under permanganate oxidation can liberate the syringyl groups and generate the Mäule color that is emitted. These reports show that the Mäule treatment is effective for detecting syringyl lignin. However, the <b>Mäule</b> <b>reaction</b> has several flaws including rapid color fading, leaching of colored lignin into aqueous ammonia, and swelling or breaking of tissue samples. Thus, although it is a useful technique, many improvements are needed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Lignins of two vesselles angiospermous species, Sarcandra glaber and Sarcandra spicatus, gave mainly vanillin, 4 -ethoxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid, and guaiacylpropanones in {{alkaline}} nitrobenzene oxidation, permanganate oxidation after ethylation, and acidolysis, respectively and low methoxyl contents as in coniferous lignin. IR {{spectra of}} the lignins also showed characteristics of coniferous lignin. These {{data indicated that}} both plants contain guaiacyllignin as has been suggested by <b>Maule</b> negative <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{traditional}} <b>Mäule</b> color <b>reaction</b> was {{improved by}} use of tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-hydrochloride acid (Tris–HCl) buffer coupled with a fluorescence microscope. The purple-red color of Mäule-treated hardwood was more stable with the novel treatment than with traditional treatment. In addition, Mäule-treated wood samples had a characteristic fluorescence when excited with blue (460 – 495  nm) light. Examination of white birch (Betula platyphylla) showed that syringyl-rich and guaiacyl-rich cell walls emitted red and yellow fluorescence, respectively. Measuring the fluorescence spectra of hardwood and softwood powders after treatment with the new Mäule reagents showed that hardwood powder containing syringyl lignin emitted a red fluorescence, whereas softwood powder containing guaiacyl lignin emitted a green fluorescence when excited with blue light. In conclusion, this improved technique has many advantages compared with the traditional Mäule color test.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of polyphenols on the analysis of lignin by histochemical methods, namely, the <b>Mäule</b> color <b>reaction</b> coupled with microspectrophotometry and ultraviolet microspectrophotometry, in wood of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. globulus. Thin sections and wood meals were extracted with solutions of alkali at different concentrations. The amounts of alkali-soluble extractives increased with increasing concentrations of NaOH. By contrast, there was no clear correlation between amounts of Klason lignin and the concentration of NaOH. The visible-light absorption spectra of cell walls of all woody tissues from both species changed after alkali extraction. In particular, the spectra of cell walls of vessel elements changed considerably, even when only a dilute solution of alkali was used. Ultraviolet absorption spectra did not show clear changes after extraction with alkali. These results indicate that polyphenols in cell walls affect the results of histochemical analysis. Therefore, a preliminary extraction with alkali, namely, extraction with a 1 % solution of NaOH, is needed to assess the precise distribution of lignins in the cell walls of Eucalyptus wood by histochemical methods. The cell walls of wood fibers of Eucalyptus camaldulensis contained both guaiacyl and syringyl units and those of vessel walls contained mostly guaiacyl units. However, the cell walls of wood fibers in Eucalyptus globulus contained mainly syringyl units, while those of vessel elements contained both guaiacyl and syringyl units. Syringyl-type polyphenols, which have spectra similar to those of syringyl-type lignins, were found in the cell walls of wood fibers and vessel elements and in cell corners among wood fibers in both species of Eucalyptus...|$|R
