Average seed yield, total seed yield, 1000 seed weight, germination rate, emergence rate, stressful condition emergence rate, <b>mean</b> <b>days</b> to germination, <b>mean</b> <b>days</b> to emergence, stressful condition <b>mean</b> <b>days</b> to emergence were determined in this experiment. Observations on foraging behavior were recorded for the daily initiation, cessation, peak hours of foraging activity, weight of pollen load and number of flowers visited per minute by a bee for determining foraging activity. Results revealed that the seed yield per bulb was higher in open plots (5. 74 g/flower) than in caged plots(1. 29 g/flower). Total seed yield per plot was 898. 95 g/plot in open sided whereas it was 220. 65 g/plot in caged groups.

Methods In a clinical trial of chloroquine vs. chloroquine plus doxycycline vs. doxycycline alone against Plasmodium vivax (n = 64) or Plasmodium falciparum (n = 98) malaria, the total white cell (WCC) and platelet (PLT) counts were measured on Days 0, 3, 7 and 28 in 57 indigenous Papuans with life long malaria exposure and 105 non Papuan immigrants from other parts of Indonesia with limited malaria exposure. Results The <b>mean</b> <b>Day</b> 0 WCC (n = 152) was 6. 492 (range 2. 1 – 13. 4) × 10 9 /L and was significantly lower in the Papuans compared to the non Papuans: 5. 77 × 10 9 /L vs. 6. 86 × 10 9 /L, difference = - 1. 09 [(95 % CI - 0. 42 to - 1. 79 × 10 9 /L), P = 0. 0018]. 14 (9. 2 %) and 9 (5. 9 %) patients had leukopaenia (9 /L) and leukocytosis (> 10. 0 × 10 9 /L), respectively. By Day 28, the mean WCC increased significantly (P = 0. 0003) from 6. 37 to 7. 47 × 10 9 /L (73 paired values) and was similar between the two groups. Ethnicity was the only WCC explanatory factor and only on Day 0. The <b>mean</b> <b>Day</b> 0 platelet count (n = 151) was 113. 0 (range 8. 0 – 313. 0) × 10 9 /L and rose significantly to 186. 308 × 10 9 /L by Day 28 (P 9 /L) : 119 / 151 (78. 81 %) vs. 16 / 73 (21. 92 %, P 9 /L) vs. falciparum (122. 125 × 10 9 /L) patients.

In animals inoculated with H. hominis by the intracerebral or intraperitoneal route, both ara-AMP and ara-A were highly {{effective in reducing}} mortality even when treatment was begun 48 to 96 h after viral inoculation. ara-AMP was the most effective in both models in that treatment could be initiated 24 to 48 h later {{in the course of}} infection than with ara-A and still confer significant protection. In mice inoculated intraperitoneally, protection due to ara-AMP therapy was associated with reduced replication of virus in visceral organs and complete inhibition of transmission of virus to the brain. PAA treatment of mice inoculated intraperitoneally was effective in reducing mortality only if initiated shortly after infection. Treatment with PAA did not reduce mortality of mice inoculated intracerebrally but did prolong the <b>mean</b> <b>day</b> of death. When mice were inoculated intranasally with H. hominis, none of the three drugs altered final mortality; however, treatment with ara-AMP did prolong the <b>mean</b> <b>day</b> of death.

40|$|Abstract The ecological-constraints model {{proposes that}} {{increased}} group size increases within-group feeding competition, necessitating increased travel and, conse-quently, constraining group size. Previous studies {{have supported the}} model for frugivores, but its applicability to folivores remains untested. This study evaluated the generality of the model by re-examining the relationship between day range and group size for a folivorous spe-cies for which published accounts have not found a rela-tionship between these factors. This study differs from earlier studies by accounting for variation in food avail-ability, which may drive changes in day range. We quan-tified the relationships among food availability, day range, and group size for two red colobus groups at Ki-bale National Park, Uganda. <b>Mean</b> <b>day</b> range and home range were significantly greater for the group of 48 indi-viduals compared {{to the group of}} 24 individuals. The large group traveled more and rested less than the small group. The large group also traveled more rapidly than the small group. Food availability significantly predicted <b>mean</b> <b>day</b> range for the large group, but not for the small group. Analyses of covariance demonstrated that the large and small group responded differently to changes in food availability. These observations suggest that the large red colobus group experiences greater levels of within-group feeding competition than the small group. This study provides added support for the generality of the ecological-constraints model and contributes toward an understanding of the mechanisms controlling feeding competition and social organization in primates...|$|E

Twelve patients (48 %) died at <b>mean</b> <b>day</b> 40 and median day 26. Levels of ionized calcium, parathormone, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, magnesium, and phosphate for patients who lived were compared with levels for patients who died. The incidence of hypotension, renal failure (creatinine {{greater than or equal}} to 3. 0), and bacteremia, as well as the amount of red cell, crystalloid, and colloid administration for the two groups was compared. Hypotension, bacteremia, red cells, crystalloid, and colloid were no different. On days 1 and 2 ionized calcium levels were significantly lower and parathormone levels significantly higher in nonsurviving patients; this difference persisted through days 3 and 4. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increased early in nonsurviving patients but renal failure, which occurred in nine nonsurviving patients, did not develop until <b>mean</b> <b>day</b> 14, median day 18.
