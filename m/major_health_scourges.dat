40|$|Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} is a <b>major</b> human <b>health</b> <b>scourge</b> {{and a key}} cause of mortality. Its {{pathogenicity}} partly results from the phenomenon of "cytoadherence" mediated by the PfEMP 1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) family. Extracellular domains of PfEMP 1 s are variable and bind various host endothelial receptors, whereas their cytoplasmic domains (VARCs) are relatively conserved. VARCs affix PfEMP 1 s in the human erythrocyte membrane by interacting with host cytoskeleton proteins and exported parasite proteins. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for PfEMP 1 phosphorylation (on VARC) and propose an important function for this modification. Specific inhibitors and enhancers {{have been used to}} identify erythrocytic casein kinase II (CKII) as the enzyme responsible for VARC modification activity. We have also delineated probable CKII target residues on VARC, which mainly reside in an N-terminal acidic cluster. Our data show that VARC phosphorylation alters its binding to parasite encoded knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). Finally, we demonstrate reduced cytoadherence of infected RBCs to endothelial receptors like ICAM- 1 and CSA (these contribute to cerebral and placental malaria, respectively) in response to their CKII inhibition. Collectively, this study furthers our understanding of VARC function, underscores the importance of erythrocytic CKII in cytoadherence, and suggests a possible new target for anti-cytoadherence molecules...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{remains a}} <b>major</b> public <b>health</b> <b>scourge</b> {{affecting}} {{millions of people}} worldwide. An effective antimalarial vaccine is currently lacking and if available would add to other malaria control strategies. Although antibodies (Abs) are thought to mediate protective immunity to malaria, the exact Ab-mediated mechanisms or immunological correlates of protection against the complex plasmodial parasite remain unclear. Standardized assays for Ab measurement are also lacking and therefore no consensus exists on the best approach to quantitate, report and interpret antimalarial Abs. In an attempt {{to address some of}} these hurdles, this dissertation aims to implement robust standardized assays for measurements of Plasmodium-specific Abs and to investigate Ab avidity as a potential surrogate marker of vaccine-mediated protection against malaria. In the first study, a novel cytometric based immunofluorescence assay technique is described that improves the detection of anti-plasmodial Abs using whole parasites and may be suitable for investigating Ab-based correlates of protection. An overlap subtraction algorithm (OSA) developed in parallel eliminates the investigator-dependent effects and thus facilitates the data analysis process. The workflow was applied to pre-(D 0) and post-vaccination (D 84) clinical samples from children and adult participants of Phase 1 trials of the malaria vaccine GMZ 2. The results demonstrate that children vaccinated with the highest GMZ 2 dose (100 µg) showed a 1. 33 -fold increase in percent positive fluorescent cells (PPFC; p= 0. 003) on D 84 compared to D 0. Meanwhile, on D 84, a vaccine-induced boosting effect of pre-existing anti-parasitic immunity (1. 23 -fold increase in mean fluorescent intensity; MFI, p= 0. 03) was observed in semi-immune adults. In a second study, a modified ELISA-based method to assess the avidity index (AI) of anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP) Abs elicited by two immunization (0 - 1 - 2 month and 0 - 1 - 7 month) schedules with the malaria vaccine RTS,S in a cohort of healthy African infants was used. The analyses revealed that the avidity maturation of anti-CSP Abs following RTS,S vaccination occurred as expected, although absolute AI did not predict vaccine efficacy. The AIs of Abs were found to be similar in both immunization schemes. Interestingly, the change in anti-CSP Ab titer (dCSP) and avidity index (dAI) between second and third immunization was associated with 77 % and 54 % riskreduction to develop clinical disease, respectively. Avidity maturation of vaccine-specific Abs deserves further investigation as surrogate marker of protective efficacy. Together, standardized new tools for investigating parasite-specific Ab responses were developed and the detailed investigation of anti-CSP Ab avidity expands contemporary understanding of Ab-mediated indicators of protective immunity against malaria. These studies might serve as a basis for further work on Ab-based immunity to malaria and contribute to the development and evaluation of functional second-generation antimalarial vaccines...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: The {{trauma of}} traffic {{accidents}} and particularly cranial trauma are, {{due to their}} frequency and severe consequences in both the short and long term, a real public <b>health</b> <b>scourge</b> on a global scale. Studies of the epidemiology of cranial trauma by traffic accidents and their prognosis are rare at least in underdeveloped or developing countries. In addition, the impact of extracranial lesions on cranial trauma prognosis has long been discussed. The purposes of our study were to examine the epidemiological aspects and to determine the factors correlated to the immediate and distant prognosis of isolated cranial trauma.|$|R

For this reason, a technical study of this important public <b>health</b> <b>scourge</b> is important. The quantitative techniques employed are usually highly aggregated and will not correctly identify the determinant variables of the problem. This paper examines the relationship between urban road accidents and variables related to road infrastructure, environment, traffic volumes and traffic control. Some accident-prone sections {{in the city of}} Cartagena (Colombia) are specifically identified by the empirical Bayesian method based on GIS. A total of 69 accident-prone sections were identified in the city. It was evident that the marginal effect on the accident rate for motorcycles is well above that for cars and buses. Empirical evidence also showed that the sections located in commercial areas tend to have higher frequency of accidents due to the high presence of pedestrians...|$|R
