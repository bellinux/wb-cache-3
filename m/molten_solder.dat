25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in {{a solder}} joint formation: interaction between the substrate and <b>molten</b> <b>solder,</b> and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The base metal dissolves in the <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable barrier layer to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{lowers the}} melting point, {{improves}} resistance to thermal cycle fatigue, and improves wetting {{properties of the}} <b>molten</b> <b>solder.</b> It also slows down the rate of dissolution of copper from the board and part leads in the liquid solder. Forms intermetallic compounds. May promote growth of tin whiskers. Supersaturated (by about 1%) solution of copper in tin may be employed to inhibit dissolution of thin-film under-bump metallization of BGA chips, e.g. as Sn94Ag3Cu3.|$|E
25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the role of Cu content in the {{dissolution}} kinetics of Cu in high-Sn solders during the solid/liquid reaction accompanied by interfacial intermetallic compound formation. Small additions of Cu (0. 7 %, 1. 5 %) in high-Sn solders dramatically decrease the dissolution rate of Cu at low temperatures. Sn- 3. 5 Ag, as expected, has a dissolution rate similar to that of pure Sn. The difference in dissolution rate of Cu in various <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> is explained in terms of the solubility limit of Cu in <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> based on the Cu-Sn phase diagram. The correlation between the metallurgical aspects of interfacial eta(Cu 6 Sn 5) phase formation and dissolution kinetics of Cu in <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> leads {{to an understanding of the}} mechanism that controls the dissolution rate of Cu in <b>molten</b> <b>solders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} {{influence of}} computational modelling in all technological processes generates an {{increased demand for}} accurate values of the physical properties of the materials involved, which are used as fundamental inputs for every model. In the production of electronic circuits, a thorough knowledge of the thermal conductivity of <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> {{can result in a}} better controlled soldering process. As a result, this information can be used for setting the optimum soldering profile and thereby lead to improvement in the quality control of the solder joints. This paper describes the principles of the experimental technique employed for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> and describes the essential features of the instrumentation.

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the dissolution of}} plated iron in <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> {{and the effect of}} iron-plating conditions on reactions in <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder,</b> the reaction test between Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (mass%) solder and plated iron was performed. An Iron-plated copper plate, which was made by electroplating iron onto an oxygen-free copper substrate, was used as the test piece. The reaction test was carried out by using an oven in normal air. The solder was placed on the test piece and it was put into an oven held at 400, 430 and 460 C. The interface between the solder and plated iron was particularly examined. It was found that the intermetallic compound of FeSn 2 was formed at the interface regardless of the plating conditions. The results showed that the grain size of plated iron decreased with the increased current density and the dissolution thickness of plated iron in <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> increased with the increased current density in the rack plating. In the barrel plating, the grain size was rather small in all the test pieces and the dissolution thickness was rather thick. Thus it has been made clear that the dissolution of plated iron in <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> is attributable to the grain size of plated iron...|$|R

The control of the interfacial reaction rate is of great importance for liquid solder interconnects for high temperature electronic assemblies. Conventional electroless Ni-P barrier metallizations {{have been found to be}} inadequate for providing long term protection of the underlying metallization from the attack of <b>molten</b> <b>solders.</b> In this paper, binary Ni-P was modified with the co-deposition of a refractory alloying element, tungsten (W), from its soluble metal salt added to the plating bath. Critical parameters for the deposition of ternary Ni-W-P were identified. The long term reaction between Ni-W-P and <b>molten</b> Sn-Bi <b>solder</b> at 200 degC was studied.

40|$|AbstractMicro {{droplets}} of <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> were ejected at 230 °C using a piezoelectric inkjet printing process. The {{effect of the}} micro droplet formation of <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> was investigated on the pulse time of the waveform. In this study, a numerical system for simulating the shape evolution of micro droplet of <b>molten</b> lead-free <b>solder</b> in the inkjet printing process was developed based on a solution algorithm (SOLA) scheme for the solution of velocity and pressure fields. It is coupled with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) and piecewise-linear interface construction (PLIC) techniques for the transport of mass and construction of the interface. For the treatment of surface tension effects, a CSF (continuum surface force) model is employed. The simulation results were validated with experimental observations.

50|$|Ultrasonic {{soldering}} uses either ultrasonically coupled heated solder iron tips (0.5 - 10 mm) or ultrasonically coupled solder baths {{as mentioned}} above. In these devices, piezoelectric crystals {{are used to}} generate high frequency (20 - 60 kHz) acoustic waves in <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> layers or batch, to mechanically disrupt oxides that form on the <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> surfaces. The tips for U/S soldering irons are also coupled to a heating element while the piezoelectric crystal is thermally isolated, not to degrade the piezoelectric element. Ultrasonic soldering iron tips can heat (up to 450 °C) while mechanically oscillating at 20 - 60 kHz. This soldering tip can melt solder filler metals as acoustic vibrations are induced in the <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> pool. The vibration and cavitation in the <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> then permits solders to wet and adhere to many metal surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} {{activators}} {{is primarily}} disruption and removal of the oxide layer on the metal surface (and also the <b>molten</b> <b>solder),</b> to facilitate direct contact between the <b>molten</b> <b>solder</b> and metal.

The results indicate that when the addition of P element in the pure tin solder up to 35 ppm, the static oxidation rate of pure tin decreased to 12. 1 g/m 2 from 26. 5 g/m 2, while the dynamic oxidation rate decreased from 8. 9 g/m 2 t...|$|R
40|$|The wetting {{reactions}} between eutectic AuSn solder and Au foil {{have been}} studied. During the reflowing, Au foil dissolution {{occurred at the}} interface of AuSn/Au, which increases with temperature and time. The activation energy for Au dissolution in <b>molten</b> AuSn <b>solder</b> is determined to be 41. 7 kJ/mol. Au 5 Sn is the dominant interfacial compound layer formed at interface. The activation energy {{for the growth of}} interfacial Au 5 Sn phase layer is obtained to be 54. 3 kJ/mol over the temperature range 360 ℃ to 440 ℃. Wettability of the <b>molten</b> AuSn <b>solder</b> ball is a temperature-dependence process. At 390 ℃, AuSn solder balls exhibited best wettability among all reflowing cases (wetting angle is about 25 °). Kinetics of wetting was proposed to be controlled by the oxidation and Au dissolution rates on the wetting front of spreading <b>molten</b> AuSn <b>solder.</b> Below 390 ℃, the Au dissolution rate dominates the progression of the wetting front.

Rectangular partsare assembled to their corresponding binding sites on a glass substrate {{in an air}} environment. Rectangular binding sites are the only hydrophilic areas on the substrate. By a dip-coating process, <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> wet only the binding sites on the substrate. The parts with misalignment angle up to 90 degrees can be rotated and translated to align with the binding sites during orbital shaking. Before the shaking, the solder is reflowed by heating to 120 degrees C. The alignment completed within 3 s. The yields of the self-assembly for misalignment angles ranging from 15 degrees to 90 degrees are at least 80 %. The integrity of the bonding between the parts and the binding sites is confirmed by a static debonding test. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The addition of a small amount of Ni to the <b>molten</b> SnPb <b>solder</b> (0. 1 wt. %) retarded that spalling and helped to prevent dewetting.

RNDr. Miloš Janeček, CSc., Department of Physics of Materials Abstract: Due to recent restriction {{of the classical}} Sn-Pb solder alloy, lead-free solders became an extensively investigated class of materials. This thesis focused on selected Sn-Cu based alloys. The influence of Cu content and minor additions of Ni and P on IMC layers morphology and reliability of simulated solder joints were investigated. The growth kinetics of IMC layers {{and mechanical}} properties of solder joints were studied after reaction of <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> with Cu substrate at various times and temperatures, and after subsequent ageing at elevated temperatures. Detailed analysis {{of the evolution of}} IMC layers morphology was performed using EBSD. Higher Cu concentration in solders decreased the dissolution rate of Cu substrate. It was shown that the addition of 0. 1 at. % of Ni significantly changed the morphology of IMC layers and improved mechanical properties of solder joints.

In this research, production modules were soldered using adipic acid / isopropanol as a flux and atomized formic acid {{to further enhance}} oxide reduction over the <b>molten</b> <b>soldered</b> module. The objectives of the evaluation were to assess system capability, measurable performance versus conventional {{wave soldering}} equipment performance as well as environmental impact. The system capability for overall machine performance, frombelt speeds to repeatable solder heights and solder joints has demonstrated the effectiveness of inert gas soldering over current conventional soldering technology. The inert gas system Performance versus conventional process performance using production level product has demonstrated the feasibility the system has for production implementation by lowering the solder defect rate by a four fold improvement. The positive environmental impact of inert gas soldering is reductions in volatile organic compounds (VOC), lead, and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions. An added environmental emission is formic acid in which operator safety and stack emissions are maintained to current safety standards. Finally, cost comparison of inert gas soldering to conventional wave solder systems is very favorable when total costs of the cleaning machines with CFCs and floor space are compared.

40|$|The {{present study}} shows that it is {{possible}} to join 3 D wire structure by brazing. It is proved that the cross points are filled with <b>molten</b> <b>soldering</b> metal by exploitation of the capillary force. To compare these modifications, the 3 D wire structure specimens of two different metals with non-joined and joined nodes have been analyzed with regard to their mechanical performances under compressive loading. The results show that the joining leads to increased strength and stiffness of such structures. Highest stiffness and yield strength was achieved with brazing paste Ni 102 (of Umicore AG & Co. KG) but the realized dip coating process is not as reproducible as e. g. the deposition processes. For future prospects a good ductility under load is requested to obtain high energy absorption of such structures. Therefore ductile copper or copper-alloys seem to be promising brazing solders because no brittle phases in the joint were observed. The gained results are an important step within the ongoing research project to create sandwich panels with 3 D wire structures as core-layer were the metal coating can be used as bonding material to braze the structure itself and also the cover plates in one step. The present study serves for better evaluation which joining technology to choose for a good compromise between reproducibility, mechanical performance and economic processing...|$|R

30|$|Amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys are newly {{developed}} materials {{with a number of}} superior physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, which are of significant importance for basic scientific research and potential engineering applications [1, 2]. The amorphous alloys are characterized by short-range order and long-range disorder, without the presence of any grain boundary in their crystallographic structure, whereas, the nanocrystalline materials possess high specific surface areas and a large density of grain boundaries or interphase boundaries. These distinct features are expected to bring about novel phenomena such as wetting at their surfaces/interfaces different from those of conventional coarse-grained polycrystalline substrates [3]. On the other hand, up to now, the maximum dimensions of the bulk amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys that can be directly prepared are still quite limited, typically no more than centimeters, thus constraining their applications in many situations. A potential way to achieve breakthrough in the size limitation is to develop appropriate joining techniques [4, 5]. Regarding the fact that the structures of both the amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys are thermodynamically metastable, being very sensitive to heat treatment, the heat input in the joining should be carefully controlled to avoid a wide range of crystallization of the amorphous alloys and overgrowth of the nanocrystallites, which can deteriorate properties. Soldering, as a low-temperature joining process, is a potentially feasible method [5], and the wettability of these metastable alloys by <b>molten</b> <b>solders</b> plays a crucial role in this process [6]. However, only a few preliminary studies [6 – 10] have so far focused on this important issue, leaving many fundamental questions unsolved.|$|R

High dissolution rate of Cu resulted in thick Cu-Sn intermetallic compound formation during soldering and Cu enrichment in wave soldering bath.
