Based on {{the toxicity}} of dysprosium chloride to mice, {{it is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be fatal to a human.

Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined. Both are more massive than the 5 kg recommendation of the IAU 2006 draft proposal as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E

5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many <b>more</b> <b>could</b> die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E
5|$|On the Droits de l'Homme, many {{survivors}} {{were too}} weak to reach the boats, {{and a number of}} men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many <b>more</b> <b>could</b> not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The last two people to leave the ship were the commanders General Humbert and Commodore Lacrosse. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the Cumberland were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts to save lives from the shipwreck.|$|E

In Australia, even if {{the level of}} education is positively related to trust overall, the link with trust is much weaker than in the United States.|$|R

25|$|His {{political}} opinions (and Galton's as well) were strongly inclined against the coercive, authoritarian forms of eugenics that became so {{prominent in the}} 20th century. Note that even Galton's ideas about eugenics were not the compulsory sterilisation or genocidal programs of Nazi Germany, but he instead hoped that by encouraging more thought in hereditary reproduction, human <b>mores</b> <b>could</b> change {{in a way that}} would compel people to choose better mates.|$|R

25|$|The next {{significant}} {{event was}} on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, {{and more than}} 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the birds were in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed and the remainder scattered before any <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be killed. No more birds were sighted that day.|$|E

25|$|After {{discussions in}} February and March 1916 with Chief Secretary Augustine Birrell—who {{did not believe}} press talk of an armed Irish {{uprising}} but wanted more troops as a deterrent—Friend (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) and Wimborne (Lord Lieutenant) French {{said that he could}} spare only a single cavalry brigade as reinforcements, and later offered an extra reserve infantry brigade, although in the event Friend declined (7 April) to make formal application for the brigade to be sent. French thought little <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be done unless the government changed its assessment of the threat.|$|E
25|$|This {{represented}} {{a change from}} previous eras, in which offensive action was the primary mission. In the Napoleonic Wars, for instance, there were instances of massive cavalry charges used for tactical envelopments of infantry formations. The technology of the rifled musket, which emerged in the 1850s, put an effective end to this practice. While swiftly moving cavalry could overwhelm infantry whose weapons fired accurately only 100 yards, the infantryman with a rifled musket (accurate to 300 yards or <b>more)</b> <b>could</b> fire multiple rounds {{in the time it}} took the cavalry to reach his position. A horse and rider were easy targets for these shots.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, Ireland has the {{greatest}} number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe. Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs. With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so <b>more</b> <b>could</b> be discovered.|$|E
