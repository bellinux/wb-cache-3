40|$|The spatial {{variability}} and temporal variation of furrow inflows {{have a major}} impact on the performance of furrow irrigation, as indicated by the usual <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> efficiency and uniformity. They also cause difficulties in determining the soil infiltration characteristic through inverse solution techniques and in selecting preferred values for the operational variables of flow rate and time to cut-off to give maximum performance at the field scale. In this paper a steady spatially-varied flow analyses is performed to predict the steady water surface profiles in a typical head ditch and the subsequent {{spatial variability}} of the furrow inflows, for both pipe or siphon and sill or bank-less type water application systems. The resulting patterns were very similar to those seen in the spatially varied pipe flow in gated pipe, with depths and outflows increasing toward the downstream end of the channel. It is shown that it is feasible to design head ditches to minimise the variability in outflows. An unsteady analysis of the same head ditch illustrated the variation of outflows with time caused by the time taken to fill the channel. ...|$|E

The study also investigated the possible influence of certain background variables {{on each of these}} techniques. In particular, Gender, as well as Vocabulary Ability, Reading Ability, Visual Materials Ability and Language Usage as measured on a grade four Canadian Test of Basic Skills were used. [...] The two instructional treatments developed included a series of short descriptive text passages, each accompanied by a representative picture or illustration. Each treatment was then produced in two different formats, combined and separate referred to as Module 1 C, Module 1 S, Module 2 C and Module 2 S. The combined module in each treatment required that each text passage and associated picture be presented on the same page. The separate module required that the text passage and associated picture be presented on separate pages alternately. [...] Two grade nine classes were chosen for this study each containing twenty-eight students. The selection was done on the basis of students having no previous exposure to the specific topics described in the study, and a random grouping of abilities in each class. Students were not placed in one group or the other based on any differences in their abilities. Both groups experienced Treatment 1 and Treatment 2, but not the same format for each.

The dependent variables were recall scores on tests 1 and 2 and application scores on tests 1 and 2. The independent variables were Treatment 1, and Treatment 2. The background variables investigated to determine possible influences on the independent variables were Vocabulary, Reading Ability, Visual Materials Ability, Language Usage and Gender.

40|$|Fluency has {{recently}} been operationalized {{in terms of the}} acquisition of performance rates that predict a number of learning outcomes, depicted in the acronym RESAA, which represents skill retention, endurance, stability, application and adduction (Johnson and Layng, 1996). The RESAA model has not yet been adequately researched under controlled, experimental conditions. A preliminary study (Study 1) compared two rate-building procedures, under experimental conditions, with five Year 2 children {{with a mean age of}} six years eight months and seven pre-primary children with a mean age of four years seven months. The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled. Long-term follow-up RESAA measures were conducted three months after the completion of the intervention. The major study in this research project (Study 2) is an empirical investigation of the effects on RESAA measures of increasing the performance rates of a component skill in reading to specific, incremental rate aims with twelve Year 2 children aged between six years eight months and eight years one month who were categorized into three levels of reading ability. Speeded practice was compared to slow-paced constrained-rate practice. The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{increase}} utilization, multicore pro-cessors share memory resources among {{an increasing number of}} cores. This sharing leads to memory interference, which in turn leads to a non-uniform degradation in the execution <b>of</b> concurrent <b>applications,</b> even in the presence of fairness mechanisms. Many utilities rely on application CPU Time both for measuring resource usage and inferring application progress. These utilities are therefore directly affected by the distorting effects of multicore interference on the representativeness of CPU Time as a proxy for progress. This makes reasoning about myriad properties from fairness, to QoS, to throughput optimality very difficult in consolidated environments, such as IaaS. We introduce the notion of Quality Time, which provides a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> progress analogous to CPU Time’s <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> resource usage, and we propose a simple online sampling-based technique to approximate Quality Time with high accuracy. We have implemented three user-space tools called Qtime, Qtop, and Qplacer. Qtime can attach to an application to calculate its Quality Time online, Qtop is a dashboard that monitors the Quality Times <b>of</b> all <b>applications</b> on the system, and Qplacer leverages Quality Time information to find better application placements and improve overall system quality. With Quality Time, we are able to reduce the error in inferring execution efficiency from 150. 3 % to 25. 1 % in the worst case and from 30. 0 % to 7. 5 % on average. Qplacer can increase average system throughput by 3. 2 % when compared to static application placement. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{interference}} on {{shared resources}} caused by concurrently executing applications unpredictably prolongs their execu-tion. Hence, {{determination of the}} Worst Case Execution Time (Wcet) <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> executing on shared memory multi-core processors is hard to estimate. This hinders the adoption of Commercial Off The Shelf (Cots) multi-core processors in hard real-time systems. The existing techniques opt for tailored multi-core architectures to pro-vide high computation power at predictable execution time. However, this approach yields poor resource utilization and high costs. In this paper, we present a technique to <b>measure</b> the Wcet <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> on multi-core architectures using existing measurement based timing analysis tools. Our technique has a minor area impact (≈ 5 %). However, this impact {{is limited to the}} emulation devices only and production chips remain unchanged.

The technique is demonstrated by <b>measuring</b> Wcet <b>of</b> benchmark <b>applications</b> using the RapiTime timing analysis tool.
