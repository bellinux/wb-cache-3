CAMDs enable {{context-aware}} management of policies allowing the grouping of entities based on context information. Since context is dynamic, so is the domain membership. As a consequence, the association of policies with the entities in the domain also becomes dynamic. In this paper we provide CAMD examples and an information model together with a discussing on our ongoing implementation for our target context-aware service platform. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. Industrial {{psychology}} is an applied sub-discipline of psychology, and industrial psychologists {{are trained to}} be behavioural specialists in the workplace. As such, industrial psychologists approach workplace problems or enhance organisational functioning from a behavioural perspective. Industrial psychologists also function as human resource management practitioners within organisations. An investigation was conducted to determine how behavioural science could ideally be applied by industrial psychologists in the human resource <b>management</b> <b>domains.</b> The importance of investigating this research question was to enable or enhance the practise of industrial psychologists when functioning in the human resource <b>management</b> <b>domains.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to create a socially constructed futuristic framework that could inform industrial psychologists on how they could practically apply psychology in human resource management. A qualitative approach was utilised to explore the research question. Industrial psychologists (21) that function in the realm of human resource management were involved as participants through personal semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus groups to provide an informed perspective on the behavioural scientific role of psychologists in the human resource <b>management</b> <b>domains.</b> The main contribution of this study is that industrial psychologists may be better able to position themselves in order to embed behavioural science in the human resource <b>management</b> <b>domains.</b> The implications of the findings are discussed.

40|$|Management and {{automation}} {{are important}} issues in enterprise environments, often consuming the largest {{fraction of the}} overall IT budget. A key challenge here is co-ordination across multiple management solutions deployed in different <b>management</b> <b>domains,</b> including across hardware and software, across different levels of abstraction, and across different hosts. This paper makes three contributions to addressing this problem. First, we propose a novel management co-ordination architecture for virtualized environments. Our architecture includes two powerful abstractions – m-channels, which provide mechanisms for communication between the hardware, virtual machines, and applications and m-brokers, which allow high-level policy co-ordination across different management agents. Second, we discuss Dom-M, an instantiation of our architecture {{in the context of}} the Xen hypervisor, and identify tradeoffs between different implementations of such <b>management</b> <b>domains.</b> Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement and evaluate different cross-level solutions for power management using our abstractions, and also discuss qualitatively other applications including storage backup, inventory management, and trust management. 1...|$|R
