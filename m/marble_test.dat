40|$|AbstractUrsolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that {{possesses}} several {{biological and}} neuropharmacological effects including antidepressant-like activity. Anxiety disorders represent common and disability psychiatric {{conditions that are}} often associated with depressive symptoms. This work investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of ursolic acid administration in different behavioral paradigms that evaluate anxiety in mice: open field test, elevated plus maze test, light/dark box <b>test</b> and <b>marble</b> burying <b>test.</b> To this end, mice were administered with ursolic acid (0. 1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, p. o.) or diazepam (2 mg/kg, p. o.), positive control, and submitted to the behavioral tests. The results show that ursolic acid (10 mg/kg) elicited an anxiolytic-like effect observed by the increased total time {{in the center and}} decreased number of rearings responses in the open field test and an increased percentage of entries and total time spent in the open arms of elevated plus maze, similarly to diazepam. No significant effects of ursolic acid were shown in the light/dark box and <b>marble</b> burying <b>test.</b> These data indicate that ursolic acid exhibits anxiolytic-like effects in the open field and elevated plus maze test, but not in the light/dark box and <b>marble</b> burying <b>test,</b> showing the relevance of testing several behavioral paradigms in the evaluation of anxiolytic-like actions. Of note, the results extend the understanding on the effects of ursolic acid in the central nervous system and suggest that it may be a novel approach for the management of anxiety-related disorders...|$|R
40|$|The bowing {{phenomenon}} is so relevant that two projects, EU funded, from 1999 studied {{it and a}} European standard to assess the resistance to thermal and moisture cycles (influencing bowing) has been recently adopted. In particular, according EN 16306 : 2013, measurements of bowing and flexural strength should be performed before {{and at the end}} of the ageing cycles. Additional non-destructive tests are recommended but are not compulsory for the standard. Moreover, Annex A of EN 16306 contains guidance on the limit values for the selection of marble types suitable for outdoor uses, especially façade applications. Eleven varieties of <b>marble</b> have been <b>tested</b> by means of this laboratory ageing test. Non-destructive tests such as the measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), Adjacent Grains Analysis, open porosity, and water absorption have been executed together with the conventional flexural strength test. The results obtained from image analysis on thin sections indicate that the AGA index may not always be correlated with the other tests: amount of bowing, loss of flexural strength, or loss of UPV. Some consideration of the decrease of mechanical resistance and the bowing in relation to the variety of <b>marble</b> <b>tested</b> and the limit values indicated in Annex A of EN 16306 can be noted. It is known that bowing and rapid strength loss occur in some varieties of marble when used as exterior cladding and other exterior applications.

40|$|As a Lagrangian mesh-free {{numerical}} method, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{method has}} been traditionally applied for modeling astrophysics, fluid flows and thermal problems, {{and there has}} been a growing interest in applying SPH to solid deformation problems. However, the potential of this method for quasistatic analysis of rock-like brittle materials has not been clearly explored. The major aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of key factors in SPH on the load-deformation response of rock-like solids, including variations in the particle approximation theory, the magnitude of the smoothing length and its variable method. Simple uniaxial compression (UC) loading conditions were chosen, and a series of numerical studies were carried out sequentially on an idealized elastic case and an actual <b>test</b> of <b>marble</b> material. Typical results of the axial stress-strain response from infinitesimal to finite deformation as well as the progressive failure process for the <b>marble</b> <b>tests</b> are given and the influences of various factors are discussed.

40|$|We have {{previously}} identified Usp 46, which encodes for ubiquitin-specific peptidase 46, as a quantitative trait gene affecting the immobility time of mice {{in the tail}} suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test. The mutation that we identified was a 3 -bp deletion coding for lysine (Lys 92), and mice with this mutation (MT mice), as well as Usp 46 KO mice exhibited shorter TST immobility times. Behavioral pharmacology suggests that the gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor is involved in regulating TST immobility time. In order to understand how far Usp 46 controls behavioral phenotypes, which {{could be related to}} mental disorders in humans, we subjected Usp 46 MT and KO mice to multiple behavioral tests, including the open field test, ethanol preference test, ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex test, sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding <b>test,</b> <b>marble</b> burying <b>test,</b> and novel object recognition test. Although behavioral phenotypes of the Usp 46 MT and KO mice were not always identical, deficiency of Usp 46 significantly affected performance in all these tests. In the open field test, activity levels were lower in Usp 46 KO mice than wild type (WT) or MT mice. Both MT and KO mice showed lower ethanol preference and shorter recovery times after ethanol administration. Compared to WT mice, Usp 46 MT and KO mice exhibited decreased sucrose preference, took longer latency periods to bite pellets, and buried more marbles in the sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding <b>test,</b> and <b>marble</b> burying <b>test,</b> respectively. In the novel object recognition test, neither MT nor KO mice showed an increase in exploration of a new object 24 hours after training. These findings indicate that Usp 46 regulates a wide range of behavioral phenotypes that might be related to human mental disorders and provides insight into the function of USP 46 deubiquitinating enzyme in the neural system...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the acute effects of ST- 1283, a novel H 3 R antagonist, on anxiety-related and depression-related behaviors in comparison with those of diazepam and fluoxetine. The effects of ST- 1283 were evaluated using the elevated plus maze test, open field <b>test,</b> <b>marbles</b> burying <b>test,</b> tail suspension test, novelty suppressed feeding test, and forced swim test in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The results showed that, like diazepam, ST- 1283 (7. 5 mg/kg) significantly modified all the parameters observed in the elevated plus maze test. In addition, ST- 1283 significantly increased the amount of time spent in the center of the arena without altering general motor activity in the open field test. In the same vein, ST- 1283 reduced the number of buried marbles as well as time spent digging in the <b>marbles</b> burying <b>test.</b> The tail suspension test and forced swim test showed that ST- 1283 was able to reduce immobility time, like the recognized antidepressant drug fluoxetine. In the novelty suppressed feeding test, treatment with ST- 1283 decreased latency to feed with no effect on food intake in the home cage. Importantly, pretreatment with the H 3 R agonist R-α-methylhistamine abrogated the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of ST- 1283. Taken together, the present series of studies demonstrates the novel effects of this newly synthesized H 3 R antagonist in a number of preclinical models of psychiatric disorders and highlights the histaminergic system as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety-related and depression-related disorders.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of herbal ethanol {{extracts}} of Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP-EX), on chronic electric footshock (EF) stress-induced anxiety disorders were investigated in mice, which were orally treated with GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) once a day for 14 days, followed by exposure to EF stress (2 mA, with an interval and duration of 10 s for 3 min). After the final exposure to EF stress, the elevated plus-maze and <b>marble</b> burying <b>tests</b> were performed, and the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, the serum levels of corticosterone, and the expression of c-Fos in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) were determined. Treatment with GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) significantly recovered the number of entries into open arms and time spent on open arms, which was reduced by chronic EF stress. GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) also {{reduced the number of}} marbles buried, which was increased by chronic EF stress. In addition, electric EF stress significantly decreased the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which was recovered by treatment with GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg). The serum levels of corticosterone, which were markedly increased by chronic EF stress, were reduced by treatment with GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg). Chronic EF stress-induced increases in c-Fos expression were also markedly reduced by GP-EX (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) in the PVN. These results suggest that GP-EX shows anxiolytic functions, determined by the elevated plus-maze and <b>marble</b> burying <b>tests,</b> which are mediated by modulating the activity of dopamine and serotonin neurons as well as the expression of c-Fos in the brain, and the serum levels of corticosterone.

The aim {{of this study was to}} behaviourally phenotype VDR knockout mice. We characterized the behaviour of VDR null mutant mice and wildtype littermate controls by subjecting them to a range of tests including a primary behavioural screen (using the SHIRPA protocol), rotarod, gait analysis, Y-maze, <b>marble</b> burying <b>test,</b> bedding test, holeboard test, elevated plus maze, open field test and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. There were no effects of genotype on most of the scores from the SHIRPA protocol except that VDR -/- mice had alopecia, were shorter and weighed less than VDR +/+ mice. VDR -/- mice had a shorter gait as well as impairments on the rotarod, in the bedding test and impaired habituation in both the open field and on the acoustic startle response. The VDR -/- mice had normal acoustic startle responses but had impaired PPI at long (256 ms) but not short (64 ms) prepulse to pulse intervals. The VDR -/- mice were less active in the open field and buried fewer marbles in the <b>marble</b> burying <b>test.</b> However, there were no differences in the time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze or in working memory as assessed by repeat arm entries on the Y-maze.

A {{series of}} {{fracture}} toughness tests {{have been conducted}} on a type of coarse grain <b>marble.</b> The <b>tests</b> were carried out either in pure mode I or in pure mode II conditions by using the cracked chevron notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) specimen. A total number of 44 CCNBD specimens were tested, half in pure mode I and the rest in pure mode II, to obtain reliable values for mode I and mode II fracture toughness (KIc and KIIc) of the <b>tested</b> <b>marble.</b> The average value of KIc for this marble was approximately about 1. 12 mMPa showing a good agreement with those reported for similar coarse grain marbles. The mode II fracture toughness {{was found to be}} 2. 25 mMPa in average which is approximately twice the mode I fracture toughness. However, the conventional fracture criteria suggest that the mode I fracture toughness should be higher than the mode II fracture toughness, (KIc>KIIc). According to these criteria, the ratio of KIIc / KIc is a figure typically between 0. 63 and 0. 96. It is shown in this paper that enhanced mode II fracture toughness of CCNBD specimen could be due to the effects of highly negative T-stress when the specimen is subjected to mode II. It is also shown that an improved prediction for the ratio KIIc / KIc can be achieved when the effect of T-stress is taken into account...|$|R

40|$|The recent European {{standard}} EN 16306 : 2013 specifies laboratory methodology on {{the determination}} of the resistance to thermal and moisture cycling of marble for cladding of building façades. In particular measurements of bowing and flexural strength should be performed before {{and at the end of}} the ageing cycles. Bowing is measured on specimens of dimension 30 * 100 * 400 mm exposed to moisture from beneath and heating (gradually till 80 C) on the upper face. The flexural strength should be measured both on reference and on exposed specimens in order to assess the variation of mechanical properties. Additional non-destructive tests are foreseen but are not compulsory for the standard. Moreover, the Annex A of the EN 16306, contains a guidance of the limit values that could be useful for the building planner for façade panels dimensioning. Different varieties of marble (two from Italy, one from Greece and three from Portugal) have been tested by means of this laboratory ageing test. Non-destructive tests such as the measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), porosity, and water absorption have been executed together with the conventional flexural strength test. Image analysis on thin sections soaked with methylene blue have been analysed to further investigate the correlation between porosity and tendency to bowing. Base on the results obtained, some consideration on the decrease of mechanical resistance and the bowing in relation to the variety of <b>marble</b> <b>tested</b> and the limit values indicated the Annex A of EN 16306 can be drawn. Besides, from the data analysed a deepened discussion has been made. It is known that bowing and rapid strength loss occur in some varieties of marble when used as exterior cladding but further considerations can be made: bowing and flexural strength are correlate and in which way? Often the bowing is related to the decrease of flexural strength but it happens that there is a decrease in the mechanical resistance of the stone also without the bowing phenomenon. Non-destructive tests are surely useful to evaluate deterioration of mechanical properties but attention should be paid to the analysis of results, correlating the information coming from UPV measures with that from porosity evaluatio...|$|R

Several mixed mode fracture tests were conducted on Harsin marble using cracked semi circular bend (SCB) specimens to obtain the mixed mode fracture resistance envelope in the complete range from pure mode I to pure mode II. However, the experimental results were not consistent with the classical mixed mode brittle fracture criteria.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that activation ofmetabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu 4) leads to anxiolytic- and antipsychotic-like efficacy in rodent models, yet its relevance to depression-like reactivity remains unclear. Here, we present the pharmacolog-ical evaluation of ADX 88178 [5 -methyl-N-(4 -methylpyrimidin- 2 -yl) - 4 -(1 H-pyrazol- 4 -yl) thiazol- 2 -amine], a novel potent, selective, and brain-penetrant positive allosteric modulator of the mGlu 4 receptor in rodent models of anxiety, {{obsessive compulsive disorder}} (OCD), fear, depression, and psychosis. ADX 88178 dose-dependently {{reduced the number of}} buried marbles in the <b>marble</b> burying <b>test</b> and increased open-arm exploration in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, indicative of anxiolytic-like efficacy. Target specificity of the effect in the EPM test was confirmed using male and female mGlu 4 receptor knock-out mice. In mice, ADX 88178 reduced the likelihood of conditioned freezing in the acquisition phase of the fear conditioning test, yet had no carryover effect in the expression phase. Also, ADX 88178 dose-dependently reduced duration of immobility in the forced swim test, indicative of antidepressant-like efficacy. ADX 88178 reduced DOI (2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodoamphetamine) -mediated head twitches (albeit with n...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} brand new {{recycling}} route of waste marble powder, by means of surface modification with homemade nano-TiO 2 particles to produce low cost coating materials for the application in air quality improvement. The as-prepared nano-TiO 2 in anatase phase exhibits excellent photocatalytic characteristic, reflected by the high degradation rate of over 95 % of methylene blue within 6 hours of UV irradiation. The prepared coating consisting of nano-TiO 2 clad <b>marble</b> powder was <b>tested</b> by monitoring the decomposition rate of formaldehyde gas. A high degradation efficiency of about 95 % within 9 hours of illumination is achieved, demonstrating a promising potential for removing the harmful and toxic organic pollutants in air while applying this coating in buildings both interiorly and exteriorly...|$|R
40|$|Gleen Glass, a small {{production}} glass {{company that}} creates countertops, {{was selected for}} the Technology Assistance Program through Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Gleen Glass was seeking material property analysis comparing glass as a countertop material to current surfaces (i. e. marble, granite and engineered stone). With samples provided from Gleen Glass, testing was done on granite, marble, and 3 different glass surfaces ('Journey,' 'Pebble,' and 'Gleen'). Results showed the glass surfaces have a lower density, lower water absorption, and are stronger in compressive and flexural tests as compared to granite and <b>marble.</b> Thermal shock <b>tests</b> showed the glass failed when objects with a high thermal mass are placed directly on them, whereas marble and granite did not fracture under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} {{disorders are}} neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by two core symptoms; impaired social interactions and communication, and ritualistic or repetitive behaviors. Both epidemiological and biochemical {{evidence suggests that}} a subpopulation of autistics {{may be linked to}} immune perturbations that occurred during fetal development. These findings have given rise to an animal model, called the "maternal immune activation" model, whereby the offspring from female rodents who were subjected to an immune stimulus during early or mid-pregnancy are studied. Here, C 57 BL/ 6 mouse dams were treated mid-gestation with saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a bacterial infection, or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly IC) to mimic a viral infection. Autism-associated behaviors were examined in the adult offspring of the treated dams. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess motor activity, exploration in a novel environment, sociability, and repetitive behaviors, and data analyses were carried independently on male and female mice. We observed a main treatment effect whereby male offspring from Poly IC-treated dams showed reduced motor activity. In the <b>marble</b> burying <b>test</b> of repetitive behavior, male offspring but not female offspring from both LPS and Poly IC-treated mothers showed increased marble burying. Our findings indicate that offspring from mothers subjected to immune stimulation during gestation show a gender-specific increase in stereotyped repetitive behavior...|$|R
40|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} (BED) {{is characterized by}} uncontrolled consumption of {{a large amount of}} food in a brief period of time. A large body of evidence has shown that BED can be a chronic condition associated with elevated psychiatric comorbidity, including depression and anxiety, and compulsive behavior. In this study we used an animal model of BED in which binge eating behavior was induced in female rats by providing limited access to high fat diet (margarine) to investigate the emotional traits of bingeing animals before and after the binge-like consumption of margarine. Using the plus maze test to disclose a potential anxious phenotype, we found that bingeing rats are much more anxious before the access to margarine, and that this condition is significantly reduced after its consumption. Conversely, no difference was detected between bingeing rats in the <b>marble</b> burying <b>test</b> before and after access to margarine. Yet, the number of marbles buried by bingeing rats before margarine consumption was significantly higher than control groups thus suggesting a compulsive-like trait. In the forced swimming test, bingeing rats showed a decrease in depression-like behavior after the consumption of margarine. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the occurrence of an altered emotional state in female rats showing binge eating behavior...|$|R
