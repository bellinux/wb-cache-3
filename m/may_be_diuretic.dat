40|$|SummaryUrea {{transporter}} (UT) proteins, including UT-A in kidney tubule epithelia and UT-B in vasa recta microvessels, facilitate urinary concentrating function. A {{screen for}} UT-A inhibitors {{was developed in}} MDCK cells expressing UT-A 1, water channel aquaporin- 1, and YFP-H 148 Q/V 163 S. An inwardly directed urea gradient produces cell shrinking followed by UT-A 1 -dependent swelling, which was monitored by YFP-H 148 Q/V 163 S fluorescence. Screening of ∼ 90, 000 synthetic small molecules yielded four classes of UT-A 1 inhibitors with low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration that fully and reversibly inhibited urea transport by a noncompetitive mechanism. Structure-activity analysis of > 400 analogs revealed UT-A 1 -selective and UT-A 1 /UT-B nonselective inhibitors. Docking computations based on homology models of UT-A 1 suggested inhibitor binding sites. UT-A inhibitors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> useful as <b>diuretics</b> (“urearetics”) with a mechanism of action that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> effective in fluid-retaining conditions in which conventional salt transport-blocking diuretics have limited efficacy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS are {{first-line}} antihypertensive agents {{but their}} effects {{in patients with}} chronic renal diseases have not been clearly defined. The available information concerning the renoprotective ef-fects of calcium antagonists is complex {{in view of the}} conflicting data coming out of various clinical trials. Based on a critical review of the available litera-ture, some conclusions are drawn here. (i) Use of calcium antagonists in hy-pertensive patients with renal disease is safe and has no deleterious effects on renal functions. (ii) Calcium antagonists <b>may</b> <b>be</b> better than <b>diuretics</b> and β-blockers to protect renal function against hypertension. (iii) Renin-angiotensin axis-blocking agents are more effective than calcium channel blockers to reduce proteinuria and to prevent renal disease progression. (iv) The combination of calcium antagonists and renin-angiotensin axis-blocking agents <b>may</b> <b>be</b> beneficial to improve renal protective effects of ACE inhibi-tors or angiotensin receptors blockers when administered singly. (v) As sug-gested in some recent reports, the new-generation calcium antagonists, which have the property of vasodilator action on both afferent and efferent glomeru-lar arterioles, may have interesting renal protective effects. More clinical studies will be needed to confirm this possible beneficial effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an aqueous extract of the leaves of Sansevieria senegambica on plasma marker enzymes, plasma {{chemistry}} and the haematological profile of salt-loaded rats were studied. The control group received only a commercial feed, whilst the four test groups received a diet consisting of the commercial feed and salt, although the reference treatment group was reverted to the normal feed {{at the end of}} 6 weeks. The extract was orally administered daily at 150 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg body weight to two test groups, respectively; whilst the test control, reference and control groups received equivalent volumes of water by the same route. The extract had no negative effects on markers of liver and kidney functions, but it did produce leukocytosis, significantly increased (p &lt; 0. 05) plasma calcium and potassium levels and significantly decreased (p &lt; 0. 05) plasma sodium and chloride levels in the test animals compared to the test control animals. This result supports the traditional use of Sansevieria senegambica in the management of hypertension, whilst suggesting that the extract <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a potassium-sparing <b>diuretic</b> whose mechanism of antihypertensive action <b>may</b> <b>be</b> achieved through alteration of plasma sodium and potassium balances, or through calcium-mediated changes in vascular muscle tone...|$|R

40|$|Background: Aminophylline, an {{established}} bronchodilator, is also purported to <b>be</b> an effective <b>diuretic</b> and anti-inflammatory agent. However, {{the data to}} support these contentions are scant. We conducted a prospective, open-label, single arm, single center study to assess the hypothesis that aminophylline increases urine output and decreases inflammation in critically ill children. Methods: Children less than 18 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit who were prescribed aminophylline over a 24 -hour period were eligible for study. The use and dosing of aminophylline was independent {{of the study and}} was at the discretion of the clinical team. Data analyzed consisted of demographics, diagnoses, medications, and markers of pulmonary function, renal function and inflammation. Data were collected at baseline and at 24 -hours after aminophylline initiation with primary outcomes of change in urine output and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Results: Thirty-five patients were studied. Urine output increased significantly with aminophylline use (median increase 0. 5 mL/kg/hour ([IQR:- 0. 3, 1. 3], p= 0. 05) while BUN and creatinine concentrations remained unchanged. Among patients with elevated C-reactive protein concentrations, levels of both interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 10 decreased at 24 -hours of aminophylline therapy. There {{were no significant differences in}} pulmonary compliance or resistance among patients invasively ventilated at both time points. Side effects of aminophylline were detected in 7 of 35 patients. Conclusions: Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this study, aminophylline <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a useful <b>diuretic</b> and effective anti-inflammatory medication in critically ill children. Given the incidence of side effects, the small sample size and the uncontrolled study design, further study is needed to inform the appropriate use of aminophylline in these children...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{traditional}} medicines as a <b>diuretic</b> agent has <b>been</b> increasing in recent years. The diuretic activity {{of a number}} of plant extracts used as diuretic agents in ethnomedicine has been confirmed in experimental animals. However, despite the widespread use of Peganum harmala in traditional medicine, there is a paucity of data supporting its use as a diuretic agent. Therefore, the present study aimed to envisage the true effect and magnitude of diuresis of methanolic extract of P. harmala (MEPH) in comparison with a well-known diuretic drug furosemide using Wistar albino rats. MEPH was administered orally in three different doses (150, 300 and 450 mg/kg) to experimentally dehydrated rats. Furosemide (10 mg/kg orally) was used as a reference drug. The diuretic effect of the MEPH was evaluated by measuring urine volume, urine pH, urinary electrolyte levels, natriuretic and saliuretic effects. The urine volume (in mL) measured at 5 h and 24 h and electrolyte excretion (Na+, K+, and Cl−) at 24 h duration were measured. The urine output and urinary electrolyte excretion were found to be significantly higher in rats treated with MEPH as compared to normal rats in a dose dependent manner (P< 0. 05). The results of our study were comparable to furosemide drug. Based on observed results, we can recommend that P. harmala <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an effective <b>diuretic,</b> however, toxicity studies should be conducted before administration...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the pathogenesis of}} post-obstructive diuresis, a state of functional "anuria" during ureteral obstruction was created in awake rats by (a) bilateral obstruction (BO); (b) unilateral obstruction and contralateral nephrectomy (UO-Nx); or (c) unilateral obstruction and continuous i. v. reinfusion of urine from the intact contralateral kidney (UO-reinf). These groups were compared with unilaterally obstructed (UO) and sham-operated control (sham) rats. After release of obstruction of 24 h duration, mean urine flows (V) and sodium excretion rates (UNaV) were significantly elevated above those of sham rats in BO, UO-Nx, and UO-reinf animals, but slightly decreased in UO rats. Glomerular filtration rates were comparably depressed in UO, BO, UO-Nx, and UO-reinf rats. These results suggest that post-obstructive diuresis is due {{to one or more}} circulating <b>diuretic</b> factors that <b>are</b> normally excreted in the urine, and which, when retained) as in BO or UO-Nx rats) or returned to the circulation (as in UO-reinf rats), exert a diuretic affect. In additional experiments, UO rats infused with urea exhibited post-obstructive diuresis, if extracellular volume contraction was prevented. This result suggests that urea <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an important <b>diuretic</b> factor in post-obstructive diuresis, but does not exclude possible roles for other humoral factors. The intact kidney of UO-reinf rats displayed a massive unilateral diuresis and natriuresis, further suggesting the presence of potent diuretic factors in the urine. A marked increase in the fractional excretion of glomerular filtrate (V/GFR) by the intact kidney suggests that this diuresis <b>may</b> <b>be</b> attributable, in part, to impaired proximal reabsorption...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the dose-dependent effects of adenosine A 1 -receptor blockade on diuresis and renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and renal impairment or diuretic resistance. BackgroundIntravenous loop <b>diuretics</b> <b>are</b> the mainstay of therapy for patients with ADHF. Treatment, however, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> complicated by <b>diuretic</b> resistance and/or worsening renal function. MethodsWe carried {{out a pair of}} randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept studies in 2 clinically challenging ADHF populations. ResultsIn the ADHF protocol, 146 patients with volume overload and an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20 to 80 ml/min were randomized to placebo or 1 of 4 doses of KW- 3902 (rolofylline) infused over 2 h daily for up to 3 days. On day 1, KW- 3902 monotherapy increased urine output during the first 6 h (445, 531, 631, and 570 ml in the 2. 5 -, 15 -, 30 -, and 60 -mg groups, respectively) compared with placebo (374 ml; p = 0. 02). On day 2, serum creatinine decreased in all KW- 3902 groups and increased with placebo (p = 0. 04). By day 4 or day of discharge if earlier, intravenous furosemide administration tended to be lower in the KW- 3902 groups compared with placebo (p = 0. 10). In the diuretic-resistant protocol, 35 patients with an average CrCl of 34 ml/min were randomized to a single infusion of placebo, 10, 30, or 60 mg of KW- 3902. Compared with placebo, KW- 3902 increased hourly urine volume and estimated CrCl with peak effects occurring at 2 to 3 h and at 24 h, respectively. Adverse events were not different between placebo and KW- 3902.
