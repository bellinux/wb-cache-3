50|$|Note: Frequency {{frogging}} {{is accomplished}} by having modulators, which are integrated into specially designed repeaters, translate a low-frequency group to a high-frequency group, and vice versa. A channel {{will appear in the}} low group for one <b>repeater</b> <b>section</b> and will then be translated to the high group for the next section because of frequency frogging. This results in nearly constant attenuation with frequency over two successive <b>repeater</b> <b>sections,</b> and eliminates the need for large slope equalization and adjustments. Singing and crosstalk are minimized because the high-level output of a repeater is at a different frequency than the low-level input to other repeaters. It also diminishes group delay distortion. A repeater that receives on the high band from both direction and sends on the low band is called Hi-Lo; the other kind Lo-Hi.|$|R
50|$|Tenders {{to supply}} the cable and other {{equipment}} were undertaken and the main supplier, Felten and Guilleaume (West Germany) was selected in early 1959). The details of the contracts were finalised by mid-1959. The cable for the Canberra-Melbourne link was manufactured by a subcontractor (Olympic Cables Pty Ltd) in Australia. The remaining cable and carrier equipment were manufactured in West Germany. Construction work was undertaken by staff of the PMG.The initial shipment of cable arrived from Germany {{at the end of}} 1959. Cable laying was completed in October 1961 and jointing and testing completed in December 1961.In total, over 960 kilometres of cable were laid and over one million tons of rock and soil excavated to lay the cable. <b>Main</b> <b>repeater</b> stations (which were attended by staff) were constructed every 64 kilometres and minor, unmanned repeater stations every 9 kilometres (103 in total. The <b>main</b> <b>repeater</b> stations also provided break out points to connect minor trunk routes to regional towns (e.g. Goulburn, Yass, Gundagai). Many of the repeater stations remain today along the route, along with cable markers and other reminders of the project.|$|R

2500|$|TTARS runs two club nets. [...] The first net is the Sunday night 2 meter net {{held on the}} 147.93MHz {{repeater}} on Sunday {{nights at}} 7:59PM local time or 2359 UTC. If the <b>main</b> <b>repeater</b> is not available, 146.94 is used as an alternate. The second net is the Hummingbird net and is held on 7.159MHz LSB in the 40 meter band on Sunday mornings at 9AM local time or 1300 UTC. These repeaters are available for use in emergencies as listed by the U.S. Navy.|$|R

50|$|Local {{television}} networks KSL-TV, KSTU and other sites on Farnsworth Peak have provided space for HAM radio repeater operation. Farnsworth peak {{serves as a}} major hub, connecting western and southern Utah to the Utah Intermountain Intertie <b>main</b> hub <b>repeater</b> a top the Snowbird Tram on Hidden Peak.|$|R
50|$|WHRO {{broadcasts}} the 1920s Radio Network, {{a channel}} dedicated to big band music, nostalgia, and old time radio on its HD-2 channel. The 1920s Radio Network streams online and is simulcast on the <b>main</b> channel of <b>repeater</b> station W257BV-FM.|$|R
50|$|CFMT {{shut down}} its {{analogue}} signal, over UHF channel 47, on August 31, 2011, the official date in which full-power television stations in larger Canadian television markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 64, which {{was among the}} high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use {{as a result of}} the transition, to UHF channel 47 for post-transition operations. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analogue channel 47. CFMT's digital repeaters in London and Ottawa also relocated to new channels for the same reason behind the relocation of the <b>main</b> signal; these <b>repeaters</b> would use their former UHF analogue channel numbers (69 and 60) as their virtual channel numbers.|$|R
40|$|Repeaters are {{now widely}} used to {{decrease}} delay {{and increase the}} performance of long interconnects. The maximum operating frequency {{is limited by the}} longest wire between two <b>repeaters.</b> The <b>main</b> goal of <b>repeater</b> insertion is to reduce the delay of the interconnects in a circuit. Increasing the number of repeaters on an interconnect increases the slew rate and the operating frequency but decreases the design performance in terms of area and power. This paper presents a new methodology of repeater insertion considering the circuit operating frequency to improve the slew rate and reduce the area overhead of the repeaters. We propose a mathematical treatment for finding the number and position of repeaters while keeping the same size of the optimal repeater size. Experimental results are shown for different frequencies and repeater sizes to indicate the improvements of slew rate and saving area overhead...|$|R
