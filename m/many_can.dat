5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed dramatically {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, <b>many</b> <b>can</b> be isolated as pure substances.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; <b>many</b> <b>can</b> be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Nest mate {{recognition}} is widespread in many eusocial insects. However, {{when there are}} no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, <b>many</b> <b>can</b> no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{a variety of}} levels, many of which require certain {{objectives}} to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. <b>Many</b> <b>can</b> be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.|$|E

50|$|Tinware is any item made of {{prefabricated}} tinplate.

25|$|Litigation {{during the}} 1970s and 1980s caused {{stagnation}} {{in the small}} aircraft market, forcing the surviving companies to retain older, proven designs.

25|$|Stabiae was {{an ancient}} Roman town near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia and {{approximately}} 4.5km southwest of Pompeii, and which became {{famous for the}} magnificent Roman villas found there in recent times.

25|$|The wheat cent was {{mainstream}} {{and common}} during its time. Some dates are rare, but <b>many</b> <b>can</b> still {{be found in}} circulation.

25|$|Various {{people who}} have been awarded provincial orders have been {{presented}} with national decorations and orders, such as the Order of Canada.

25|$|Wu Zhu Coins (AD 25). Even {{after the}} end of the Wang Mang regime (see below), the coinage system {{remained}} in disarray. Cloth, silk and grain were used as money along with coins. However, cash was the normal measure of wealth and was used in large quantities. When Yang Ping (92–195) was in economic difficulties, he was offered a gift of one million cash. Wu Zhu coins continued to be issued, along with other coins, until the end of the sixth century. Some coins can be attributed to specific reigns or events; <b>many</b> <b>can</b> not.|$|E

25|$|Among American-born {{citizens}} of Polish ancestry, roughly 50% report eating Polish dishes, and <b>many</b> <b>can</b> name {{a variety of}} Polish foods unprompted. Whereas over 60% of Italian Americans reported eating Italian food {{at least once a}} week, less than 10% of Polish Americans ate Polish food once a week. This figure is still a higher occurrence than Irish Americans, who can only name a few traditional Irish foods (typically corned beef and cabbage), and only 30% report eating Irish food each year. Even fewer English, Dutch, and Scottish Americans can report that they eat ethnic cuisine regularly.|$|E
25|$|The {{general public}} {{can also use}} Standard Chinese to {{communicate}} with mainlanders. When Chams interact with the Hainanese dialect speakers from within Hainan Province, they use the Hainanese dialect, though youngsters generally use Mandarin. Not <b>many</b> <b>can</b> communicate in Li when interacting with the Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used. In the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and when they interact with speakers of other languages, they mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. <b>Many</b> <b>can</b> imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
