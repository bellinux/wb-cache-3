40|$|A {{multilevel}} microfabrication {{process has}} been developed to produce silicon Fresnel lenses for terahertz waves. A repeated binary fabrication process was used to create lenses with up to eight levels in complexity and these lenses have been compared to both less complex structures and refractive optic lenses. The microfabrication required deep reactive ion etching and <b>multilevel</b> <b>resist</b> processing using SU 8 photoresist. At the design frequency of 1 THz an eight-level lens showed significant improvement in intensity at the focus and had much reduced energy lost into sidelobes compared with refractive lenses...|$|E
40|$|A {{silylation}} process employing hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS 3 Ì†e as a silylating {{agent was}} examined as a ethod of combining the high resolution capabilities of a <b>multilevel</b> <b>resist</b> {{and the process}} simplicity of a single layer resist scheme. Atmospheric pressure vapor phase silylation and liquid phase silylation were performed on Kodak 809 Micropositive resist. The vapor phase silylation {{did not result in}} significant alteration of the etch characteristics. The liquid phase silylation was performed for several HMDS concentrations in Freon. Liquid phase silylation was shown to provide significant etch selectivity upon exposure to an oxygen plasma...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the design, simulation, manufacture, and {{evaluation}} of diffractive optical elements. Particularly, kinoforms and diffractive bifocal intraocular lenses are studied. Evaluation of kinoforms, i. e. computer generated phase holograms, manufactured by photolithography and electron-beam lithography are presented. E-beam lithography {{has the ability to}} manufacture high efficiency diffractive optical elements, in particular micro-Fresnel lenses, which was not possible before. <b>Multilevel</b> <b>resist</b> kinoforms manufactured with direct writing e-beam lithography with a diffraction efficiency up to 85 % are presented. How to compensate for the electron scattering during exposure and to optimize the development are discussed in two different papers within this thesis. Kinoforms used as array illuminators and/or for use in laser machining are/is also presented. The thesis also treats the optical properties of diffractive bifocal intraocular lenses by using three methods: bench measurements, computer simulations, and in vivo measurements. The last part of the thesis deals with letter imaging with diffractive bifocal intraocular lenses using computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|Presently {{there are}} several {{approaches}} to achieving a high throughput, production worthy X-ray lithography system. One approach utilizes a conventional X-ray source with fast X-ray resist materials to expose a large diameter wafer (typically 3 " to 4 " in one step). Another approach also utilizes a conventional X-ray source (or perhaps a plasma X-ray source) and fast X-ray resist materials to expose in a step and repeat fashion a large diameter wafer (e. g., < 5 "). A third approach utilizes a storage ring source of X-ray radiation in combination with conventional resist materials (i. e., AZ, PMMA, etc.) to expose large diameter wafers in a step and repeat fashion. In particular, single step exposure systems are limited to small diameter wafers due to registration errors which are ameliorated in step and repeat systems. Furthermore, the complex <b>multilevel</b> <b>resist</b> processing necessary to obtain high throughput {{in the first two}} approaches is unattractive to some manufactur-ers. However, it may be one economic way of obtaining relatively high throughput for some applications that require a small volume of devices with < 1 p. m features. For high volume manufacturers with well established production lines using conventional resist processing, a multiple port storage ring system offers economical and performance advantages relative to other exposure systems (i. e., electron beam) for VLSI manufacturing. The important parameters of each fo the above approaches will be described in this talk...|$|E
