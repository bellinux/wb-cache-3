50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to bring more {{advanced}} steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the Doble Steam Car which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient <b>monotube</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923, Doble's steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40 seconds or less.|$|E
50|$|A flash boiler {{is a type}} of {{water-tube}} boiler. The {{tubes are}} close together and water is pumped through them. A flash boiler differs from the type of <b>monotube</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> in which the tube is permanently filled with water. In a flash boiler, the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated. Flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the 19th century and this use continued into the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{magazine}} {{covered a}} broad range of topics within 'steam power', often at a far more advanced level than contemporary railway and steam locomotive practice. Low-water-content water-tube boilers were commonplace and even <b>monotube</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> and uniflow engines were regular features. Although the terms were not yet in use, these technical features coincided with increased recognition of the Advanced Steam Technology and Modern Steam movement.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the sake}} of efficiency, it is {{desirable}} to minimise the steam content of the generator. Heat can then be transferred efficiently into liquid water, rather than into low-density <b>steam.</b> <b>Monotube</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> may either boil gradually along their length, usually pumped circulation systems, but where this boiling does not disrupt the circulation. Otherwise they can use the Benson supercritical system, where the pressure is sufficient to prevent boiling (within the heated volume) altogether.|$|R

50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to bring more {{advanced}} steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the Doble Steam Car which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient <b>monotube</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923, Doble's steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40 seconds or less. When the boiler had achieved maximum working pressure, the burner would cut out until pressure had fallen to a minimum level, whereupon it would re-ignite; by this means the car could achieve around 15 miles per gallon (18.8 litres/100 km) of kerosene despite its weight in excess of 5000 lb. Ultimately, despite their undoubted qualities, Doble cars failed due to poor company organisation and high initial cost.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons, {{pressurised}} and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

40|$|A high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is under development by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>generators</b> are a {{critical}} component of a nuclear power reactor, and can contribute significantly to station unavailability, as has been amply demonstrated in PWRs. Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU®) <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> are not immune to <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> degradation, and the variety of CANDU <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> designs and tube materials has led to some unexpected challenges. However, aggressive remedial actions, and careful proactive maintenance activities, have resulted in a decrease in steam generator-related station unavailability of Canadian CANDU reactors. AECL and the CANDU utilities have defined programs that will enable existing or new <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> to operate effectively for 40 years. Research and development (R&D) work covers corrosion and mechanical degradation of tube bundles and internals, chemistry, thermalhydraulics, fouling, inspection and cleaning, as well as provision for speciality tool development for specific problem solving. A major driving force is development of CANDU-specific fitness-for-service (FFS) guidelines, including appropriate inspection and monitoring technology to measure <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> condition.

Longer-range work focuses on development of intelligent on-line monitoring for the feedwater system and <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> New <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> designs have reduced risk of corrosion and fouling, are more easily inspected and cleaned, and are less susceptible to mechanical damage.

5000|$|A boiler or <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is {{a device}} {{used to create}} steam by {{applying}} heat energy to water.

40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>generators</b> {{are crucial}} {{components}} of pressurized water reactors. The {{failure of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> {{as a result of}} components degradation by corrosion has been a major cause of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) plant unavailability. <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> problems have caused major economic losses in terms of lost electricity production through forced unit out ages and, in cases of extreme damage, as additional direct cost for large-scale repair or replacement of <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes and tubesheet are susceptible to failure by a variety of mechanisms, the most majority of which are related to corrosion. The feedwater that enters the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> under normal operating conditions is extremely pure, but nevertheless contains low levels (generally in the µg/L concentration range) of impurities such as iron, chloride, sulphate, silicate, etc. When water is converted to steam and exits the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> the non-volatile impurities are left behind. As a result, the concentration of the bulk <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> water is considerably higher than that in the feedwater.

30|$|Many robots, {{including}} climbing robots, {{are designed}} for nuclear stations [10 – 17]. A <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is the key device in a nuclear power station in which heat is passed from the coolant in the primary circuit to {{the water in the}} secondary circuit to generate high-pressure and high-temperature steam for electricity. The <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is a huge cylindrical object with a 3 m diameter, and to enhance the efficiency of heat exchange, thousands of tubes are inside of it, making it a fragile device vulnerable to various problems. To make sure the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> works safely, it needs to be inspected annually. The key problem we need to solve is to get pictures of tubes which are inside of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> secondary side in real time. The inner structure of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> makes it impossible to check it manually, because the space is too small for person to fit. Obrutsky [18] summarized some technologies for <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tube inspection.
