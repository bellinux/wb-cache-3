5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> behaviour. Such dimorphism {{is common}} in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible.

Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country's {{immigration}} policies, allowing {{foreigners to}} settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas. People flocked to the area; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7,800Mexicans and 30,000English-speaking people primarily from the United States. Among the immigrants was William Barret Travis, an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer. An avid reader, Travis often devoured a novel in a single day. His taste ran primarily to romantic adventure and history, especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Benjamin Disraeli and the historical works of Herodotus. Historians have speculated that Travis's choice of reading material <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> his behavior—Travis {{was known for his}} melodramatic ways.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think {{it could have been}} bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> her grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, {{relatively}} little {{was known about}} the biology of the Chittenango ovate amber snail. Studies by investigators at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) since 1981 {{have contributed to the}} base of knowledge about the biology and life history of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Aloi (1985) analyzed the population dynamics of the succineid snails at Chittenango Falls. Thomee (1986) investigated their behavioral ecology, and Molloy and Norton (1993) developed techniques for captive propagation. Molloy (1995) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to factors influencing the distribution of Succinea sp. B. Confusion on snail identification <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> the results of Thomee's and Aloi's work, but by the time Molloy's study was initiated, the identification problems had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> unidentified flying object sightings in Washington. Suess and Persinger performed similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The July {{storm was}} not the last to damage the Treasure Coast of Florida in 1933: a much {{stronger}} cyclone in September, with winds of 125mph (200km/h), extensively damaged the same area that the July storm affected. This storm overshadowed memories of the earlier hurricane, and would be remembered as among the worst on the Treasure Coast {{as late as the}} 1980s. The occurrence of twohurricanes on the east coast of Florida in the same season is a relatively rare event in historical records, but not unprecedented: for instance, forensic research by weather historian David M. Ludlum suggests that two or more hurricanes in 1837 <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> the region. Citing reports from William Reid in Law of Storms (1838), Ludlum noted that two hurricanes affected Central and Northeast Florida on August1–2 and September6, respectively, while other storms, potentially hurricanes, may have done so later in September. The September hurricane struck between St. Augustine and Jacksonville. Incidentally, the 1837 Atlantic hurricane season was apparently very active, like 1933; as in 2004, a record four hurricanes hit the state of Florida, including the infamous Racer's Storm in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E
