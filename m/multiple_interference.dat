25|$|Despite {{no longer}} {{formally}} operating as a team, Ambrose and Reigns continued to infrequently {{work together and}} maintained an on-screen friendship following The Shield's split. On the January 9, 2015 episode of SmackDown, Reigns {{was about to be}} put into a handicap match against Rollins and Big Show until Ambrose came to the aid of Reigns and helped defeat them, with the two continuously helping each other against The Authority thereafter. On the May 4 episode of Raw, Ambrose defeated Rollins and (as per pre-stipulation by the Director of Operations Kane) gained his first opportunity for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, being added to the title match at Payback and making it a fatal four-way match, also including Reigns and Randy Orton, with the latter being pinned by Rollins. During the match, Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins briefly worked together to perform their signature triple powerbomb on Orton. Ambrose later faced Rollins at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which saw Reigns' involvement after <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> by The Authority on Rollins' behalf to help Ambrose, who won by disqualification after Rollins pushed the referee in Ambrose's way as he tried to catch the standing Rollins with his signature diving elbow drop. Despite the win, Ambrose did not gain the championship, but he still took the championship belt with him and challenged Rollins in a ladder match at Money in the Bank on June 14, which he would go on to lose.|$|E
40|$|For {{the channel}} {{assignment}} problem, {{the adequacy of}} binary channel separation constraints based on the single interferer assumption and/or a constant re-use distance has been questioned by several authors. The single interferer assumption is convenient for channel assignment purposes as it leads to a generalised graph-colouring model which is simple to formulate and very popular. However, it is desirable to approximate the operational criteria more closely than a single interferer assumption model allows, by modelling the effects of multiple simultaneous interferers. This thesis addresses the problem of modelling multiple interferers in channel assignment using constraints, {{with a view to}} finding an efficient and convenient approach which offers resilience against <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> whilst minimising additional spectral requirements. Motivated by a discussion of the literature concerning single and <b>multiple</b> <b>interference,</b> the thesis analyses the coverage failure as progressively higher numbers of multiple simultaneous interferers occur, characterising those interferers which lead to coverage reduction. A hybrid sequential and simulated annealing heuristic is applied which obtains optimised channel assignments for analysis, created under the single interferer assumption, for two-hundred-and-forty problem cases. The library of test cases is created using a purpose-built problem generator which is applied to create problems with differing randomised distributions of transmission sites. The analysis informs the consideration of methods for the reduction/elimination of multiple interferer effects. A <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> model based on higher order constraints called co-channel set constraints is assessed. Results concerning the theoretical properties of these constraints, and their satisfaction, are presented. An alternative way forward is then considered, which involves challenging the commonly applied assumption that the multiple interferer assumption implies constraints are necessarily non-binary. New methods are introduced that incorporate <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> into the generalised graph-colouring formulation i. e. binary constraints. The methods are tested using the test problem library optimised assignments are made and their resilience against <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> and the spectral requirements are used to evaluate the approaches. Evidence is provided that one of the methods provides an improved model for channel assignment with <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> and can be recommended for use to provide constraints which perform well under the multiple objectives concerned.

30|$|In multi-tier {{heterogeneous}} networks {{with different}} interference strengths in various scenarios, amplitude-space sharing {{of the signal}} and interferences is {{an effective way to}} complement the weakness of the orthogonalization-based processing. In [17], an amplitude-space sharing scheme in a two-cell network was proposed, where each BS schedules one user and the two users simultaneously scheduled in two overlapping cells consist a two-user interference channel. In different interference scenarios, the opportunities for interference cancelation are proactively created and the network sum rates are maximized through the optimized Han-Kobayashi coding [18, 19]. In multi-cell networks, Han-Kobayashi coding is no longer applicable [20], we need to study amplitude-space sharing scheme that can accommodate <b>multiple</b> <b>interference.</b> In this case, the desired signal and interference should occupy different layers in the amplitude space, and <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> may be aligned in one layer to compress their occupied spaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract | When the dierence of {{the signal}} power be-tween <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> signals is very large, the con-ventional {{adaptive}} array can't remove all the interference signals eectively. This causes a slow convergence rate and degrades {{the performance of the}} array system. The reason is that the adaptive array adapts only the interference sig-nal having the highest power. In this paper, we propose an improved adaptive array structure from the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) point of view. We uti-lize correlation improvement techniques between the input and the array output signals by controlling the gain of the array output signal. The proposed array called the auto-matic gain controlled (AGC) Applebaum array works well in <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> signals with dierent power levels.

40|$|In {{experimental}} designs {{requiring the}} administration {{of more than one}} treatment to the same subject(s), the effect of one treatment may be influenced by the effect of another treatment (Campbell & Stanley, 1963), a phenomenon known as <b>multiple</b> treatment <b>interference.</b> We conducted two studies in which <b>multiple</b> treatment <b>interference</b> in an alternating treatments design was shown to be a function of the length of the intercomponent interval (ICI) separating treatment conditions. In the first study, we evaluated the effects of four different treatments on the mouthing of a severely retarded boy. Under a 1 -min ICI no consistent differential responding to treatment was obtained. Differential responding emerged when the ICI was increased from 1 min to 120 min, thus suggesting <b>multiple</b> treatment <b>interference</b> in the lack of differential responding under a 1 -min changeover interval.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{bandwidth}} allocation with <b>multiple</b> <b>interferences.</b> In this problem the input consists {{of a set of}} users and a set of base stations. Each user has a list of requests, each consisting of a base station, a frequency demand, and a profit that may be gained by scheduling this request. The goal is to find a maximum profit set of user requests S that satisfies the fol-lowing conditions: (i) S contains at most one request per user, (ii) the frequency sets allotted to requests in S that correspond to the same base station are pairwise non-intersecting, and (iii) the QoS received by any user at any frequency is reasonable according to an interference model. In this paper we consider two variants of bandwidth allocation with <b>multiple</b> <b>interferences.</b> In the first each request specifies a demand that can be satisfied by any subset of frequencies that is large enough. In the second each request specifies a specific frequency interval. Furthermore, we consider two interference models, multiplicative and additive. We show that these problems are extremely hard to approximate if the interferences depend on both the interfered and the interfering base stations. On the other hand, we provide constant factor approximation algo-rithms for both variants of bandwidth allocation with <b>multiple</b> <b>interferences</b> for the case where the interferences depend only on the interfering base stations. We also consider a restrictive special case that is closely related to the Knapsack problem. We show that this special case is NP-hard and that it admits an FPTAS...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel sensor based on an integrated optical (IO) disk microcavity (MC) is theoretically studied. The MC is a resonant waveguide structure in which <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> of a guided mode occurs. At resonance, the MC is extremely sensitive to refractive index changes and it sustains locally enhanced optical field. Therefore, the MC is naturally suitable as an extremely responsive sensor for measuring minute changes in refractive index and/or fluorescence of an analyte. Combination of <b>multiple</b> <b>interference</b> and extremely small sampling volume (few femtoliters) provides unique sensitivity of the MC device. A factor of 9 increase in fluorescence sensitivity versus waveguide sensor is anticipated. Provided shot-noise limited detection, the refractive index resolution down to 10 − 9 is feasible with the MC sensor, which exceeds that of the straight waveguide interferometer by the order of magnitude. MC-sensors can be combined into arrays providing high throughput detection of both labeled and non-fluorescent biological species...|$|E

Here {{we focus on}} single-molecule devices, in which interference features may be strongly affected by both chemical and electronic modifications to the system.
