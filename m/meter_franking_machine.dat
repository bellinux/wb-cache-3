50|$|A postage <b>meter</b> or <b>franking</b> <b>machine</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence of postage (or franking) to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and {{eliminates the need for}} adhesive stamps.|$|R

40|$|Even small {{companies}} {{do not use}} physical stamps to prepay postal services, but have a <b>franking</b> <b>machine</b> which can be logically loaded {{with a certain amount}} of stamps which are printed on letters for example. Special purpose <b>franking</b> <b>machines,</b> which are still widely used in practice, however have security and handling problems. It was relatively easy to forge stamps and in some cases one needed to bring the <b>franking</b> <b>machine</b> to the post office to get it loaded. Therefore the USPS (US Postal Service) initiated an information based indicia program (IBIP) [1] to provide "electronic stamps". While the two problems mentioned above were solved by applying (asymmetric) digital signatures and a special purpose hardware device on the client side, it seems that this approach introduces an unreasonable overhead. In fact the problem of verifying the huge number of stamps / signatures in reasonable time is not adressed in [1] at all. Therefore many international postal service provider [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both link to the printing industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipments such as <b>franking</b> and addressing <b>machines.</b> They are all four symbiotic: technological developments affecting one obviously ricochet through the others: addressing machines print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, <b>franking</b> <b>machines</b> imprint a <b>frank</b> on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer <b>franking</b> <b>machines</b> are required and fewer addressing machines are required. For example, the advent and adoption of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded electronic stamps or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the <b>franking</b> <b>machine</b> industry, as their equipments were effectively rendered obsolescent and resulted {{in a flurry of}} lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to replacement by e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.|$|R

50|$|Hybrid mail is {{mail that}} is {{delivered}} {{using a combination}} of electronic and physical delivery. Usually, it involves digital data being transformed into physical letter items at distributed print centres located {{as close as possible to}} the final delivery addresses. An e-mail letter (also L-mail and letter mail) is a letter which sent as an email using a computer then printed out and delivered as a traditional (physical) letter. It is a communication means between the virtual cyber- and the material real world. The printer or mail transfer agent prints the electronic mail on paper, the mail transport agent packs it into an envelope and the mail delivery agent or postman delivers it to the receiver's mailbox. Generally there is a fee for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the service provider and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a <b>franking</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{exploits}} a panel {{data set}} from 18 Indian {{states over the}} period between 1993 â€“ 1994 and 2009 â€“ 2010 and identifies a set of parameters significantly affecting stamp duty revenue collection in the states. It turns out that among all the parameters, the per capita income of the state has the most significant impact on stamp duty revenue collection. The administrative reforms at the statesâ€™ stamp duty and registration departments, like introduction of <b>franking</b> <b>machines</b> and e-governance, {{have a positive impact}} on stamp duty revenue collection as well. It is found that the central governmentâ€™s choice of capital gains tax rate creates an externality on stamp duty revenue collection in the states. The results are used to critically assess the policy of lowering of stamp duty rates and introducing administrative reforms as part of the Urban Reform Incentive Fund implemented by the central government since 2003 â€“ 2004 (later subsumed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)).

5000|$|In {{hopes of}} shaking the morale {{further in the}} German people, the OSS called upon master forgers similar in nature as MI6 once had, but rather than having an image of Himmler {{replacing}} Hitler, the OSS used a stamp of Hitler, but with some minor modifications. The modifications included a skull overlay that resembles a portion of Hitler’s jaw having been [...] "eaten away" [...] and the German subscript {{at the bottom of}} the stamp altered reading [...] "Reich shot to hell". These stamps were known as the [...] "Death Head" [...] and were usually placed in the letter with other subversive materials. The letters were arranged in Reichspost bags that the OSS had forged to resemble the original bags. These precisely made bags were indistinguishable from the real German mail bags and were mimicked down to the material used. The bags would then be loaded aboard bombs specially designed to deploy the bags near a destroyed train, preferably one carrying mail, and drop the forgeries in amongst the originals in hopes that they would be put into circulation with the rest of the mail. However, all the prior planning was almost for naught because in August 1944 the Reichspost altered their <b>franking</b> <b>machines</b> on the domestic mail making the thousands of letters previously written void.|$|R
