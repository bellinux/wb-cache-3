[...] Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his Village Voice consumer guide, naming [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Breaking the Girl" [...] as highlights while writing [...] "they've grown up, they've learned to write, they've got a right to be sex mystiks." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Michael Corcoran was more reserved in his praise, deeming the record [...] "great" [...] only on occasion while finding the length of the album excessive. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is considered to be an influential album, throughout the nineties, by establishing itself as a fundamental foundation for alternative rock.

[...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for."
