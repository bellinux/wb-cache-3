30|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for improving the power efficiency of wireless devices. Vukadinovic et al. [7] present a traffic announcement solution to enhance the 802.11 PSM for multi-hop ad hoc networks. Because when a data frame is forwarded over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops,</b> only the next hop device is notified about the pending frame, devices on other hops may stay in doze mode and thus causes quite a long end-to-end delay. Proposed scheme enables each device along the routing path to send a traffic announcement to its downstream neighbor in advance. As a result, the data frames can be forwarded over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> in a single beacon interval, and the end-to-end delay in the multi-hop transmission is decreased efficiently.|$|R
30|$|In {{wireless}} networks, users or subscribers {{can experience}} unfairness {{depending on their}} location in the network. Users with <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> to destination are given less bandwidth than those with fewer hops. The unfairness stems from the shared wireless medium and unfair network protocols {{that are designed to}} maximize network capacity, that is, the aggregate throughput or do {{not take into account the}} fairness at all. Maximizing capacity and ensuring fairness are contradictory requirements and usually maximizing capacity has been preferred [2]. Unfairness is also present in multihop multichannel WMN. Users with <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> can be completely starved, while capacity, in terms of throughput, is maximized. This is naturally not fair, especially if the users pay the same amount for the service.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from poor}} performance, mesh {{networks}} suffer from multihop performance degradation and unfairness [7]. Multihop performance degradation, that is, {{the fact that}} traffic that is forwarded over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> receives {{only a fraction of}} the throughput that a single-hop flow achieves, occurs because of the random access of the MAC protocol. A flow that traverses <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> has to compete multiple times in order for the medium to reach the destination. With existing 802.11 protocols, each competition is fair, such that the probability that a multihop flow packet reaches the destination is significantly lower than that of a single-hop flow. This issue is well known, and is expected to be addressed in the upcoming 802.11 s standard for mesh networks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multi-hop {{wireless}} meshed {{networks are}} being considered as backbones in metro broadband deployments. In such networks, wireless links need to offer low link-latencies, high goodput and low residual loss rates. Due to non-line-of-sight deployments involving fading/interference, such links experience high/bursty errors, especially at higher bit rates. Traditionally, wireless links use retransmissions (ARQ) and adaptive modulation/coding to overcome loss. The price paid is reduced goodput (affecting bulk applications) and higher per-hop latencies (affecting latency-sensitive applications over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops).</b> Our paper {{starts with the}} design of a link-level hybrid ARQ scheme (LL-HARQ) to achieve high goodput and low residual loss rate with limited ARQ attempts. While LL-HARQ performs well, it exports a small residual loss rate under high/bursty loss scenarios. Over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops,</b> this small residual loss accumulates and TCP-SACK performance suffers. A transport protocol (LT-TCP) designed for loss tolerance achieves the best performance in combination with LL-HARQ, though TCP-SACK is sufficient if residual loss accumulation is under 5 %. This suggests a division of reliability functions where link-layer attempts reliability with tight latency constraints, and transport layer support handles residual erasures. We develop insights for structuring FEC, and verify the goodput-loss rate-latency trade-offs and impact of bursty losses and <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> through simulations. I...|$|R

A requirement for each application is different, i. e. high reliability for medical healthcare whereas high throughput for entertainment application.

We propose a suboptimal Decode-and-Forward with Zero Forcing (DF/ZF) strategy {{for which we}} obtain the optimal power control policy. Next, we consider the multiple relay problem. We propose three different strategies based on DF/ZF. The first strategy is a single-hop strategy {{in which all the}} relays decode the source message at the same time, then perform beamforming such that all the relays ’ signals are eliminated from the eavesdropper’s observation (full zero-forcing). We give the achievable rate by this strategy and derive the optimal power control policy. We show that, in this strategy, the relays which are far from the source create a bottleneck and limit the achievable rate. The second strategy is a <b>multiple</b> <b>hop</b> strategy that overcomes the drawback of the first strategy, however, with the disadvantage of enabling partial zero-forcing only, assuming that all the relays are required to transmit fresh information in every transmission block.
