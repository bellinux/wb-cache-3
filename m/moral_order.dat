5|$|Some {{arguments}} from <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> exists. A natural <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or <b>moral</b> <b>order.</b> Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> are based on the asserted need for <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} a practice-based understanding of ethics. Ethics is here conceived as a critical practice of questioning and problematizing <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> and <b>moral</b> rules-in-use in which subjects (re) define their relations to self and others. Situating this conception of ethics in the context of practice theory, we draw upon ideas of responsible decision-making (Derrida) and truth-telling (Foucault) to examine Daniel Ellsberg’s leaking of the "Pentagon Papers" as illustrative of ethics as critical practice...|$|R

For example, according to Lewis, Islam [...] "from the first denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents". Muhammad's message transformed society and <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> of life in the Arabian Peninsula; society focused on the changes to perceived identity, world view, and the hierarchy of values.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the usefulness of}} situating the care circulation framework in a migratory context by discussing the interconnectedness between institutional contexts and capacity, obligation and negotiated commitments. The author shows that care arrangements that result from a dialectical relationship between these three elements are influenced by migrants and their kin's respective positioning in the migration, gendered care, welfare and working-time regimes of their societies of origin and destination. The chapter also highlights the tensions that arise between various <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> within transnational family networks, and within host societies...|$|R

Some traditionalists have embraced the labels reactionary and counterrevolutionary, defying the stigma attached to these terms since the Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the colonial}} era, {{until the early}} 20th century, there was a gender {{struggle}} among Muslims in the British empire; educating women {{was viewed as a}} prelude to social chaos, a threat to the <b>moral</b> <b>order,</b> and man's world was viewed as a source of Muslim identity. Muslim women in British India, nevertheless, pressed for their rights independent of men; by the 1930s, 2.5 million girls had entered schools of which 0.5 million were Muslims.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores accusations as collaboratively {{accomplished}} in classroom peer interactions {{in the absence}} of a teacher. The analysis shows how the children use local classroom rules and teacher authority as resources and warrants to invoke multi-layered <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> and identities, and hold one child accountable through accusations about their behavior. The accused children are categorized in a duplicative way with morally degrading descriptions and as out-group members. This paper argues that understanding children’s accusations requires understanding of how such interactions compose and reflect the school context that is co-produced through the implementation of accountable ways in which to behave...|$|R

The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points {{the way to}} enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not {{the work of a}} divine being, but a result of an innate <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Miller’s {{writing in}} All My Sons often shows {{great respect for}} the great Greek tragedies of the likes of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. In these plays the tragic hero or protagonist will commit an offense, often unknowingly, which will return to haunt him, {{sometimes}} many years later. The play encapsulates all {{the fallout from the}} offense into a 24-hour time span. During that day, the protagonist must learn his fate and suffer as a result, and perhaps even die. In this way the gods are shown to be just and <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> is restored.|$|E

40|$|Competing <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> pervade {{markets and}} organizations. Previous studies of morals and markets show that {{organizational}} and occupational communities in contested areas promote one unique <b>moral</b> perspective in <b>order</b> to gain legitimacy and ensure organizational survival. In this perspective, change and innovation are only possible when distinct actors with a competing moral perspective enter a market. Yet communities do sometimes produce innovations {{at odds with}} the moral position they promote. How do they achieve this? Drawing on a 17 -months ethnography of a stem cell laboratory, I explore the ways in which competing <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> intersect in the workplace and how this collision shapes work and innovation practices. I examine two distinct moral conflicts: conflicts over safety and conflicts over bioethics. These two different types of conflicts suggest together that, far from being ethical deserts where workers conform to their organization's perspective, workplaces dealing with contested objects and technologies are spaces of intense ethical questioning and negotiation. Local moral contests are rich with creative opportunities: organizational actors innovate and shape their organizations as they seek to couple the practices and goals of their organization with their avowed personal values. This dissertation contributes to unpacking the links between morals and organizations by showing that moral legitimacy is not just a post-hoc justification of organizational products or practices but is integral to the constitution of these products and practices. This work also contributes to studies of expert work by highlighting the role of moral heterogeneity, local contests, authority over tasks, and technological innovation on the definition of social responsibility in expert communities. by Joëlle Evans.

25|$|American {{psychiatrist}} Thomas Szasz {{insisted that}} psychiatric hospitals are like prisons, not proper hospitals, and that psychiatrists who subject others to coercion function as judges and jailers, not physicians. The French historian Michel Foucault is widely {{known for his}} comprehensive critique of the use and abuse of the mental hospital system in Madness and Civilization. He argued that Tuke and Pinel's asylum was a symbolic recreation of the condition of a child under a bourgeois family. It was a microcosm symbolizing the massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: relations of Family–Children (paternal authority), Fault–Punishment (immediate justice), Madness–Disorder (social and <b>moral</b> <b>order).</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional Indian scriptures see Ṛta, a Hindu {{theological}} term {{similar to}} dharma, {{as a natural}} law that governs both the cosmos and human society. Performance of one's duties to uphold social institutions, such as marriage and family, thus becomes imperative, and duty overrides individual freedom. Dnyaneshwar is in agreement with tradition; he believes that divine order and <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> {{are one and the}} same and are inherent in the universe itself. He, therefore, recommends that all social institutions be protected and preserved in their totality. However, when it comes to the institution of caste, his approach becomes more humanitarian and he advocates spiritual egalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a {{representative}} type. Joe {{is a very}} ordinary man, decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced to accept responsibility – his suicide is necessary to restore the <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the Everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman, which {{is in many ways}} similar to All My Sons.|$|E
50|$|Social {{construction}} models generally {{say that}} there is no biological circuitry for emotions since emotions are solely based on experience and context. Some even suggest that certain emotions can only exist in the reciprocal exchanges of a social encounter. Since there are unique local languages and local <b>moral</b> <b>orders,</b> cultures can use the same emotion and expression in very different ways. Thus, emotional expressions are culturally-prescribed performances rather than internal mental events. Knowing a social script for a certain emotion allows one to enact the emotional behaviors that are appropriate for the cultural context. Emotional expressions serve a social function and are essentially a way of reaching out to the world.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} micropolitics of {{environmental}} regulation of industry through interviews with, and ethnographic observations of, regulatory inspectors. As street-level bureaucrats, inspectors {{are seen to}} cope with the legal and social ambiguities of their work mainly through negotiative forms of control- which are often idiosyncratic and partial. How inspectors construct local <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> and standards, in interaction with industrial operators, is explored in some detail, espe-cially the role of organizational ritual, symbols and emotional display as tools of control. The importance of understanding the processes of negotiated orders in the growing regulation of industry is discussed, as well as role of interpretive forms of research in such endeavours.

40|$|This essay puts {{forward the}} idea that shame is {{effectively}} a structure of inter-subjectivity that most remarkably posits an ethical gesture that trumps all <b>moral</b> <b>orders</b> and precepts. Shame stands for a form of ethics that is basically one of radical responsibility. This responsibility is not the state or fact of having a duty to the other; it is instead a solidarity not to the other, but paradoxically to one’s own cumbersomeness and that such solidarity is precisely what allows one to live ethically. Drawing {{on the work of}} Emmanuel Levinas, this essay attempts to think what would an ethics without violence could mean, that is, without a judging gaze, without the duplicitous open hand and without economy and morality...|$|R

Cainkar writes that the data suggest that women in hijab rather than men are the predominant target of anti-Muslim attacks {{not because they are}} more easily identifiable as Muslims, but because they are seen to represent a threat to the local <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> that the attackers are seeking to defend. Some women stop wearing hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.|$|E

25|$|The Jain {{theory of}} {{causation}} holds that a cause {{and its effect}} are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe.

A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not {{the work of a}} divine being, but a result of an innate <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.|$|E

25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate <b>moral</b> <b>order</b> to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E
25|$|The Vedas {{describes}} {{a number of}} significant Devis such as Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic <b>moral</b> <b>order),</b> Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the Rigveda. Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BCE to 200 CE), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Brahman, the Supreme power.|$|E
25|$|Charles Taylor, in his 2007 book A Secular Age, {{showed the}} {{historical}} role of deism, leading {{to what he}} calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a <b>moral</b> <b>order,</b> whose ontic commitment is wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence. One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit. This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability. According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a personal God and an order of miracles and mystery.|$|E
