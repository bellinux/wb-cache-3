5000|$|The {{difference}} in speed between the <b>moving</b> <b>end</b> {{of the tube}} and the stationary, hand-held end creates a {{difference in}} air pressure. A higher pressure is at the fixed end and a lower pressure is at the <b>moving</b> <b>end.</b> This difference pulls air through the tube and the air's speed changes (making {{the changes in the}} tones) with the speed of the spin. The pitch, loudness, and tone of the sound come from the tube's length and diameter, the distance between each ridge, and the speed the tube spins around, which moves the air faster or slower through the tube changing the tone in steps. ... corrugated tubes sing As the air flows first over one ridge then over a second it tumbles into a vortex. The faster the air flows through the tube, the higher the frequency of the sound produced by the vortex. When the frequency of the vortex matches one of the natural resonant frequencies of the tube harmonics, it is amplified.|$|E

As writer Norman Mark noted, [...] "CBS has flopped with {{almost all of}} its new films this season, an unequaled record." [...] One exception, however, was the much-touted A War of Children, starring Jenny Agutter as an Irish-Catholic girl in war-torn Belfast {{who falls in love}} with a British/Protestant soldier. According to New York Times critic John J. O'Connor, the film [...] "got off to a fine start and came to a convincingly <b>moving</b> <b>end.</b> It was somewhere around the middle that the drama failed became almost fatally vague." [...] But CBS's Thursday-night world premiere of Gay Talese's Honor Thy Father in March 1973 received rave notices, including one that bestowed high praise on the film's star Joseph Bologna for [...] "a highly fascinating portrayal" [...] of Salvatore Bonanno, heir to legendary crime boss Joe Bonanno.

5000|$|Entertainment Weeklys review {{singled out}} Takei's {{performance}} as [...] "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst {{a sea of}} sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen." [...] Rex Reed, in The New York Observer praised the book, score and direction, writing: [...] "The finale brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since Flower Drum Song and Pacific Overtures brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved. Linda Winer in Newsday commented that the musical [...] "carries its heavy baggage with a surprising lightness of spirit. ... The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way." [...] The San Diego Union-Tribune, having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, [...] "retains both its powerful story core {{and a good deal}} of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that - in the spirit of gaman - coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil." [...] In a review that gave Allegiance 3 stars out of four, USA Today felt that even though the show, [...] "is as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet ... but if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right." [...] Deadline magazine called Allegiance [...] "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very <b>moving</b> <b>end</b> of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{critical}} loads {{for five}} non-conservative problems are defined under {{the context of}} gradient elasticity theory of a beam. The first problem deals with the stability of a gradient elastic beam compressed by a follower force (Beck's problem) and the second deals with the stability of a gradient elastic beam compressed by a force with a fixed line of action (Rent's problem). The governing dynamic equation with the boundary conditions is formulated on the bases of simple linear elasticity theory with the beam mass concentrated on the <b>moving</b> <b>end.</b> Also the case with uniform distribution of the mass along the beam will be considered. Further the effect of an additional conservative force acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>end</b> of the beam will also be discussed.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{behavior of}} a tip leakage flow downstream of a simulated axial compressor rotor has been studied. The Virginia Tech low speed linear cascade wind tunnel was adapted to model the unsteady tip leakage flow produced by a rotor operating in the vortical wakes {{of a set of}} stator vanes. The cascade, consisting of 8 GE rotor B blades, has adjustable tip gap, inlet angle of 65. 1 o, turning angle of 11. 8 ° and solidity of 1. 076. The cascade Reynolds number, based on blade chord, was 393, 000. A <b>moving</b> <b>end</b> wall was used to simulate the relative motion between rotor and casing, and vortex generators attached to the <b>moving</b> <b>end</b> wall were used to produce an idealized periodic unsteady vortical inflow similar to that shed by the junction of a row of inlet guide vanes.

Both types of channels undergo morphological wetting transitions. For vesicles, one has a strong adhesion regime in which the vesicle shapes have constant mean curvature and exhibit effective contact angles.

The advantage of this hybrid system in comparison to the bare optomecanical cavity with a two-mode moving mirror is the controllability of the frequency of the secondary mode through the s-wave scattering interaction.
