5|$|Kidd {{was both}} {{director}} and choreographer for the musical comedy film Merry Andrew (1958), starring Danny Kaye. By the then {{the era of}} movie musicals was pretty much over, and Kidd {{turned his attention to}} Broadway, where he had continued to work while choreographing movies. At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can. In that show he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon which helped <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> Broadway sensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|Asama made a {{training}} cruise in 1921 before her armament was modified in 1922. All of her main deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder guns, were removed and their casemates plated over. In addition {{all of her}} QF 2.5-pounder guns were removed and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type AA gun was added. After the refit, she resumed her training cruises, generally at two-year intervals, until she ran aground in 1935. The damage to her bottom was severe enough that the IJN decided <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> stationary training ship in 1938.|$|E

5|$|To get to {{the high}} profile Esterbrook, Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells him where to find Claire before she {{can be turned into}} a {{radioactive}} bomb. The FBI storms the building, and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes. Estebrook arrogantly tells Olivia his lawyers will spring him out of any trouble, and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out, causing his company's stock to dramatically decrease in value. After Broyles lectures her, Olivia tells him her emotions (which she had exhibited strongly all episode) <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> better agent.|$|E
5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea.|$|E
5|$|Russell had {{not broken}} the French line and her {{opponent}} Témeraire {{got the better}} of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking the centre of the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line {{on the far side of}} the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{ordinance}} proposal was reported in December 1976, a small ripple of protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named Anita Bryant, who was a 36-year-old singer celebrity. Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in Oklahoma City and on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a born again Christian at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life. As a child, she asked God to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious. In her older teens she became a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Oklahoma and second runner-up as Miss America. In 1960, she married a Miami disc jockey named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three gold records featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the Bob Hope Christmas tour, entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President Lyndon Johnson's funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the Florida Citrus Commission endorsing Florida orange juice in television commercials. She also advertised for Coca-Cola, Tupperware, Kraft Foods and Holiday Inn. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.|$|E

25|$|Only {{thirteen}} {{poems by}} her have survived to this day. Despite the small corpus she left, {{her work is}} considered to be among the most powerful and original poetic expressions of Italian literature from the 16th century. The style and the topics she dealt with <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> forerunner of Romantic poetry and her lyrics are often a subject of feminist criticism.|$|E
25|$|Johanson's career rose rapidly {{since her}} first {{classroom}} {{teaching in the}} North York schools.

She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an atheist.|$|E
25|$|The audience's {{enthusiastic}} ovations {{pushed the}} applause meter to its apex, winning {{the competition for}} her.

For a couple of weeks thereafter, Cline appeared regularly on Godfrey's radio program. Disagreements over creative control caused Godfrey to fire her.|$|E
25|$|Laumer {{also made}} several {{controversial}} changes to Oz. He married off {{several of the}} major characters, often to unlikely prospects.

He also aged Dorothy to a teenager to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> romantic prospect for several characters, made Ozma a lesbian based on her upbringing as a boy, and made the Shaggy Man an ephebophile based on his frequent travels with young girls.|$|E
