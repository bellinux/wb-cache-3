5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a <b>mating</b> site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. <b>Mating</b> may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy <b>mating</b> is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa <b>mating</b> includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the <b>mating</b> session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total <b>mating</b> time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the <b>mating.</b> A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, <b>mating</b> with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, <b>mating</b> with some of the same males as well as others. This <b>mating</b> strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} <b>mating</b> with more than one partner within a single season. <b>Mating</b> is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to <b>mating</b> season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|During <b>mating,</b> {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of <b>mating,</b> the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while <b>mating</b> continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after <b>mating.</b> Sacrifice during <b>mating</b> is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future <b>mating</b> for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first <b>mating.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the <b>mating</b> season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents {{attempt to}} subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and raising their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for <b>mating.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up <b>mating</b> territories. <b>Mating</b> territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} <b>mating</b> season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this {{is associated with a}} steep drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the <b>mating</b> season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. <b>Mating</b> {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and <b>mating</b> can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed <b>mating</b> outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the <b>mating</b> season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a <b>mating</b> system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before <b>mating</b> season begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during <b>mating</b> season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the <b>mating</b> season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. <b>Mating</b> pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} <b>mating</b> bout.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female <b>mating</b> patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize <b>mating.</b> Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>mating,</b> {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This <b>mating</b> behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the <b>mating</b> of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, <b>mating</b> occurs from January to early February. The <b>mating</b> season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. <b>Mating</b> behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E

We find that the only dark triad to significantly predict intention to <b>mate</b> poach was psychopathy, suggesting those who scored higher on psychopathic traits were more likely to <b>mate</b> poach. Furthermore, we find that self-perceived <b>mate</b> value significantly predicted intention to <b>mate</b> poach, suggesting those who perceive themselves as having a high <b>mate</b> value, are likely to engage in <b>mate</b> poaching, which is a novel finding...|$|R

5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. <b>Mating</b> may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the <b>mating</b> season. <b>Mating</b> begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start <b>mating</b> {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the <b>mating</b> period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E
5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit <b>mating.</b> The male may create a <b>mating</b> plug following copulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mate</b> {{value is}} derived from Charles Darwin's theory of {{evolution}} and sexual selection, {{as well as the}} social exchange theory of relationships. <b>Mate</b> value is defined as the sum of traits that are perceived as desirable, representing genetic quality and/or fitness (biology), an indication of a potential <b>mate's</b> reproductive success. Based on <b>mate</b> desirability and <b>mate</b> preference, <b>mate</b> value underpins <b>mate</b> selection and the formation of romantic relationships.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that men may have evolved psychological mechanisms that motivate behaviors designed to retain a long-term partner. Some of these behaviors function by inflicting (or threatening to inflict) costs on a partner who {{might be tempted to}} be unfaithful or to terminate the relationship, whereas others function by bestowing benefits on a partner to encourage her fidelity and commitment. Previous {{research indicates}} that men of higher <b>mate</b> value are more likely than men of lower <b>mate</b> value to engage in benefit-provisioning <b>mate</b> retention behaviors, whereas lower <b>mate</b> value men are more likely than higher <b>mate</b> value men to engage in cost-inflicting <b>mate</b> retention behaviors. Existing evidence, however, rests on women’s self-reports of their own and their partner’s <b>mate</b> value as well as their partner’s <b>mate</b> retention behaviors. The current study investigates {{the extent to which the}} relationships between <b>mate</b> value and <b>mate</b> retention exist when men report on their own and their partner’s <b>mate</b> value and their own retention behaviors.
