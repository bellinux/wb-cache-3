5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD connector variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or <b>metric</b> <b>pitch</b> of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to {{understand}} what kinds of connections exist between musical rhythm and poetic and linguistic rhythm, particularly the phenomenon of accent, so I investigated accent in art songs, examining twelve songs {{in an attempt to}} further understand how and if the accents and patterns found in poetry correlate to those found in songs based on this poetry. This study examines how the patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables in Lieder by Amy Beach, Richard Strauss, and Camille Saint-Saëns correlate with musical rhythmic and accent patterns in the resulting music. I systematically determined what kinds of accents were present, where they were present, and how they were related. I tracked nine different types of musical accents: agogic, contour, dynamic, articulation, <b>metric,</b> <b>pitch,</b> phrasing, structural, and textural. I then tracked the linguistic accents in the poems themselves, with the categories of meter, individual word stresses (if different from the meter), rhyme scheme, internal rhymes, and cadences (ends of sentences and questions). I then compared the accents found in the music to the accents found in the poetry. I then compared the correlation of linguistic and musical accents through graphic representation of the values I found. I found significant correlation between musical and linguistic accents in the twelve different pieces I studied. These results suggest that, for at least these three composers, the text does in fact influence the accent patterns of the music. For the songs of Beach and Strauss, there is a visual pattern in the graphs, which matches the meter of the text. The linguistic and musical accent patterns in both Beach and Strauss songs tended to be regularly alternating in a binary fashion, in keeping with the iambic meter. For Saint-Saëns, there was overall close correlation as well. The main difference between graphs for Saint-Saëns and the others seems to be the lack of a pattern in the relative accent strengths, which can be found in both the English and German graphs. French poetry does not have an iambic pattern to it; correspondingly the music doesn 2 ̆ 7 t show the regular binary alteration of accents. This pattern or lack thereof is part of the correlation that all of the pieces share between the music and the language, and the lack of pattern seems to demonstrate a particularity in the music in the case of French. Though showing how accents in music and text correlate in the songs of English-, German-, and French-speaking composers, this thesis does not fully determine how and if musical and linguistic accents correlate in music composers other than Amy Beach, Richard Strauss, and Camille Saint-Saëns...|$|E

50|$|Roller {{chain is}} made in several sizes, the most common American National Standards Institute (ANSI) {{standards}} being 40, 50, 60, and 80. The first digit(s) indicate the pitch of the chain in eighths of an inch, with the last digit being 0 for standard chain, 1 for lightweight chain, and 5 for bushed chain with no rollers. Thus, a chain with half inch pitch would be a #40 while a #160 sprocket would have teeth spaced 2 inches apart, etc. <b>Metric</b> <b>pitches</b> are expressed in sixteenths of an inch; thus a metric #8 chain (08B-1) would be equivalent to an ANSI #40. Most roller chain is made from plain carbon or alloy steel, but stainless steel is used in food processing machinery or other places where lubrication is a problem, and nylon or brass are occasionally seen for the same reason.|$|R
40|$|Music and {{language}} share many attributes {{and a large}} body of evidence shows that sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is positively related to language development and even subsequent reading acquisition. However, such association was mainly found in alphabetic languages. What remains unclear is whether sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is associated with reading in Chinese, a morphosyllabic language. The present study aimed to answer this question by measuring music (i. e., musical <b>metric</b> perception and <b>pitch</b> discrimination), language (i. e., phonological awareness, lexical tone sensitivity), and reading abilities (i. e., word recognition) among 54 third-grade Chinese–English bilingual children. After controlling for age and non-verbal intelligence, we found that both musical <b>metric</b> perception and <b>pitch</b> discrimination accounted for unique variance of Chinese phonological awareness while pitch discrimination rather than musical metric perception predicted Chinese lexical tone sensitivity. More importantly, neither musical <b>metric</b> perception nor <b>pitch</b> discrimination was associated with Chinese reading. As for English, musical <b>metric</b> perception and <b>pitch</b> discrimination were correlated with both English phonological awareness and English reading. Furthermore, sensitivity to acoustic cues in music was associated with English reading through the mediation of English phonological awareness. The current findings indicate that the association between sensitivity to acoustic cues in music and reading may be modulated by writing systems. In Chinese, the mapping between orthography and phonology is not as transparent as in alphabetic languages such as English. Thus, this opaque mapping may alter the auditory perceptual sensitivity in music to Chinese reading...|$|R
5000|$|Knuckle threads {{with a flat}} 30 degree flank {{thread angle}} are {{standardized}} in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8mm to 200mm. [...] A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses <b>metric</b> thread <b>pitch</b> and lists diameters from 10mm to 300mm. [...] As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal point. For a thread pitch p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each thread flank is flat.|$|R

Superfine <b>pitch</b> <b>metric</b> threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of music psychology, where both psychologists {{interested}} in music and music theorists interested in psychology mingle (or at least try to), Lerdahl and Jackendoff ’s Generative Theory of Tonal Music has become the book of reference since its publication in 1983. Despite considerable work accomplished in the meantime, no other theoretical account of music sympathetic to psychology has come to replace it as the first unavoidable reading. Understandably, the task {{would prove to be}} challenging as Lerdahl and Jackendoff have covered all structural aspects tonal music encompasses, in particular both temporal (rhythmic and <b>metric)</b> and <b>pitch</b> relationships. As far as meter is concerned however, Justin London’s Hearing in Time will be more than a serious contender. For those interested in the temporal aspects of music, that is rhythm, and especially meter, I would not be surprised if it superseded the aforementioned. London, who is a music theorist, aims to stand where music theorists and psychologists can effectively meet. With a background in psychology, my reading of Hearing in Time found his attempt to have been wholly successful. The theor...|$|R

50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} <b>metric</b> system the <b>pitch</b> specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the pitch diameter. The term module is understood to mean the pitch diameter in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike diametral pitch, which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if the pitch diameter of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of pitch diameter for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.|$|R
40|$|A central aim of {{cognitive}} psychology is {{to explain how}} we integrate stimulus dimensions into a unified percept, but how the dimensions of pitch and time combine {{in the perception of}} music remains a largely unresolved issue. The goal {{of this study was to}} test the effect of varying the degree of conformity to dimensional structure in pitch and time (specifically, tonality and metre) on goodness ratings and classifications of melodies. The pitches and durations of melodies were either presented in their original order, as a reordered sequence, or replaced with random elements. Musically trained and untrained participants (24 each) rated melodic goodness, attending selectively to the dimensions of pitch, time, or both. Also, 24 trained participants classified whether or not the melodies were tonal, <b>metric,</b> or both. <b>Pitch</b> and temporal manipulations always influenced responses, but participants successfully emphasized either dimension in accordance with instructions. Effects of pitch and time were mostly independent for selective attention conditions, but more interactive when evaluating both dimensions. When interactions occurred, the effect of either dimension increased as the other dimension conformed more to its original structure. Relative main effect sizes ({pipe} pitch η 2 - time η 2 {pipe}) predicted the strength of pitch-time interactions (pitch × time η 2); interactions were stronger when main effect sizes were more evenly matched. These results have implications for dimensional integration in several domains. Relative main effect size could serve as an indicator of dimensional salience, such that interactions are more likely when dimensions are equally salient...|$|R
