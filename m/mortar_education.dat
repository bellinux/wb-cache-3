40|$|E-learning, {{understood}} as the intensive use of Information and Communication Technologies in mainly but not only) distance education, has radically changed {{the meaning of the}} latter. E-learning is an overused term which has been applied to any use of technology in education. Today, the most widely accepted meaning of e-learning coincides with the fourth generation described by Taylor (1999), where there is an asynchronousprocess that allows students and teachers to interact in an educational process expressly designed in accordance with these principles. We prefer to speak of Internet-Based Learning or, better still, Web-Based Learning, for example, to explain the fact that distance education is carried out using the Internet, with the appearance of the virtual learning environment concept, a web space where the teaching and learning process is generated and supported (Sangrà, 2002). This entails overcoming the barriers of space and time of brick and <b>mortar</b> <b>education</b> (although we prefer the term face-to-face) or of classical distance education using broadcasting and adopting a completely asynchronous model that allows access to education by many more users, at any level (including secondary education, but primarily higher education and lifelong learning) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{old school}} motto is [...] "Educating for Eternity" [...] {{and now is}} 'Hope Opportunity Promise Excellence (HOPE). The old emblem {{comprises}} a rising sun (meaning a brighter future), the Word of God as an open book (relating to Christian education), Crux (Australian heritage and the cross), Skeleton key (relating to teachers finding the key for each student) and <b>Mortar</b> board (<b>education</b> and graduation) with the words in a banner below [...] "Hope, Opportunity, Promise". A once-off school emblem was created in 2000 celebrating 20 years {{of the school and}} the current design has been used up until 2014.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study at}} Western Michigan University and the National Education Policy Center {{found that only}} a third of K12’s schools {{achieved}} Adequate Yearly Progress, which is required for public schools by the federal No Child Left Behind legislation. According to the Times, [...] "By almost every educational measure, the Agora Cyber Charter School school run by K12 is failing." [...] In Pennsylvania, 42% of Agora students tested at grade level or better in math, compared with 75% of students statewide. 52% of Agora students tested at grade level or better in reading, compared with 72% statewide. Nonetheless, Agora brought K12 $72 million in the 2011 school year - more than 10% of K12's revenue. Proponents argue that such statistics are undermined by the fact that a significant proportion of newly enrolled students begin several grade levels behind because of an alleged failure of brick and <b>mortar</b> schools. <b>Education</b> reformers such as United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, have further stated that AYP is not an accurate measure of a school’s performance and estimated that under NCLB, as many as [...] "82 percent of America's schools could be labeled 'failing'".|$|R
40|$|Global {{trends in}} higher {{education}} point to significant changes taking place. The gradual shift is caused by numerous factors such as rapidly improving technology, an increase in population numbers and socio-economic factors. The Internet has brought global information dissemination to the doorstep, introducing the concept of distributed learning and free access to knowledge. This, combined {{with the fact that}} large industries and businesses are starting to provide their own accredited electronic training courses, poses a major threat to higher education institutions. In order to remain competitive and to find innovative ways of providing quality education without building brick and <b>mortar,</b> many higher <b>education</b> institutions are establishing virtual learning environments and virtual campuses (Rossman, 1993). This paper explores the creation of a virtual campus at two higher education institutions in South Africa, namely at Technikon SA and the University of Pretoria. The different processes followed at the respective institutions are compared from a theoretical technology innovation perspective. As a traditionally distance education institution with 85 000 students, Technikon SA was geared for the transition to incorporate a virtual campus, whereas the University of Pretoria possesses a physical and administrative infrastructure which is foreign to that required of a virtual campus. Various strategies exist in technology innovation (Tidd et al. 1997) that can be usefully applied to the implementation of a virtual campus. Including incremental, radical and rational strategies, their appropriateness needs to be weighed against the culture, infrastructure and vision of the particular institution. Subsequently, the strategies followed at the respective institutions are different and the reasons for this are highlighted...|$|R
