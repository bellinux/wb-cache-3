Dietary habits {{and physical activity}} influence one 2 Ì† 7 s health status. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine and compare dietary habits in the population of high school teens enrolled in general secondary school and catering school. Methods: Study was performed using a one-time questionnaire which, among other sections included basic data needed for characterization of the group and a group of questions on participants dietary habits. Results: Data collected during this research are expressed on the whole research group and also on subgroups created considering gender, environment and educational programme. Collected data about dietary habits show drastically low breakfast consumption, low consumption of fish, fruit, vegetables, milk and dairy products, high consumption of meat and meat product, carbonized beverages and sweets. Significan difference in dietary habits was obtained for breakfast consumption, frequency of vegetables, soft drinks, milk and coffee consumption, dieting habits due to estetic <b>motives</b> and <b>fluid</b> intake.

The salts are desorbed in the boiler or steam generator, where clean steam is released and superheated in order to be expanded and generate power through the steam turbine. Boiler blowdown with the concentrated hygroscocpic compounds is used thermally to pre-heat the steam turbine condensate, and as reflux in the steam-absorber.|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} on alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) {{has shown that}} use is typically driven by hedonistic, social, functional, and intoxication-related motives, with differential associations with alcohol-related harm across these constructs. There has been no research looking at whether there are subgroups of consumers based on patterns of motivations. Consequently, the aims were to determine the typology of motivations for AmED use among a community sample and to identify correlates of subgroup membership. In addition, we aimed to determine whether this structure of motivations applied to a university student sample. Methods: Data were used from an Australian community sample (n = 731) and an Australian university student sample (n = 594) who were identified as AmED consumers when completing an online survey about their alcohol and ED use. Participants reported their level of agreement with 14 motivations for AmED use; latent classes of AmED consumers were identified based on patterns of motivation endorsement using latent class analysis. Results: A 4 -class model was selected {{using data from the}} community sample: (i) taste consumers (31 %) : endorsed pleasurable taste; (ii) energy-seeking consumers (24 %) : endorsed functional and taste motives; (iii) hedonistic consumers (33 %) : endorse pleasure and sensation-seeking motives, as well as functional and taste motives; and (iv) intoxication-related consumers (12 %) : endorsed motives related to feeling in control of intoxication, as well as hedonistic, functional, and taste motives. The consumer subgroups typically did not differ on demographics, other drug use, alcohol and ED use, and AmED risk taking. The patterns of motivations for the 4 -class model were similar for the university student sample. Conclusions: This study indicated the existence of 4 subgroups of AmED consumers based on their patterns of motivations for AmED use consistently structured across the community and university student sample. These findings lend support to the growing conceptualization of AmED consumers as a heterogeneous group in regard to motivations for use, with a hierarchical and cumulative class order in regard to the number of types of motivation for AmED use. Prospective research may endeavor to link session-specific motives and outcomes, as it is apparent that primary consumption <b>motives</b> may be <b>fluid</b> between sessions...|$|R

However, ejectors have been unable to achieve commercial maturity due to their low thermal efficiency and their intolerance to deviations from the design point. In the present work, an ejector that implements variable geometry mechanisms is proposed and evaluated using CFD simulations. In order to address the low thermal efficiency issue, changes to the design of current ejectors are also discussed in terms of its irreversibility sources; the large momentum difference between the primary and secondary flows is a well-known irreversibility source. The resulting ejector is able to operate more efficiently than current designs while maintaining a constant efficiency when subjected to variable operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|An open Rankine-cycle {{heat pump}} is ideally suited for {{producing}} low-pressure industrial process steam. Because steam serves {{as both the}} heat pump <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> and process fluid, the system achieves a unique simplicity and versatility. No intermediate refrigerant fluid exists for which to construct a process interface or impose a temperature limit. Interface components such as the heat pump condenser are not required. Moreover, the use of water vapor eliminates toxicity and flammability risks inherent with most closed-cycle heat pump fluids. The control strategy is simple. Low-pressure (subatmospheric) water vapor, generated by flashing steam at a temperature below that of the waste stream, is compressed to the process pressure and temperature by an electric-motor-driven, multistage compressor train. This strategy permits the heat pump to accommodate upsets such as sudden changes in the waste stream flow and/or temperature, as well as fluctuation within the process stream...|$|E

40|$|Steam {{is a key}} {{energy vector}} for {{industrial}} sites, most commonly used for process heating and cooling, cogeneration of heat and mechanical power as a <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> or for stripping. Steam networks are used to carry steam from producers to consumers and between pressure levels through letdowns and steam turbines. The steam producers (boilers, heat and power cogeneration units, heat exchangers, chemical reactors) should be sized to supply the consumers at nominal operating conditions as well as peak demand. First, this paper proposes an Mixed Integer Linear Programing formulation to optimize the operations of steam networks in normal operating conditions and exceptional demand (when operating reserves fall to zero), through the introduction of load shedding. Optimization of investments based on operational and investment costs {{are included in the}} formulation. Though rare, boiler failures can have a heavy impact on steam network operations and costs, leading to undercapacity and unit shutdowns. A method is therefore proposed to simulate steam network operations when facing boiler failures. Key performance indicators are introduced to quantify the networkâ€™s resilience. The proposed methods are applied and demonstrated in an industrial case study using industrial data. The results indicate the importance of oversizing key steam producing equipments and the value of industrial symbiosis to increase industrial site resilience...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” A {{jet ejector}} uses a jet of primary fluid to induce a {{peripheral}} secondary flow often against back pressure. Expansion of primary jet produces a partial vacuum near the secondary flow inlet creating a rapid re-pressurization of the mixed fluids {{followed by a}} diffuser to increase the pressure at the exit. Using the geometrical design parameters obtained by solving the governing equations, a CFD analysis is made using the FLUENT software to evaluate the optimum entrainment ratio that could be achieved for a given set of operating conditions, where the entrainment ratio (ER) is {{the ratio of the}} mass flow rate of the secondary fluid (propelled stream) to the primary fluid (<b>motive</b> <b>fluid).</b> The three main internal process forming sources of ejector irreversibility are mixing, kinetic energy losses, and normal shock. The CRMC method produces a diffuser geometry that removes thermodynamic shock process with in the diffuser at the design point-operating conditions. In order to match the ER that is achievable theoretically, an effort is made to force charge the propelled stream using a blower so that the momentum difference between the motive and the propelled fluid is minimized. The decrease in momentum difference increases the ER and the pressure lift ratio (PDE/PS) compared to the values obtained using the conventional methods, where PDE is the exit pressure and PS is the secondary fluid pressure. It also reduces losses due to pure mixing and kinetic energy loss. Experimental results obtained using the forced draft system is found to match the results obtained from the FLUENT analysis...|$|E
40|$|Environmental destruction, {{global warming}} and limited potable water {{resources}} are problems often mentioned in opinion polls that ask the public to identify major problems to be solved, this century. Demand for freshwater continues to grow, but sufficient natural sources are not always available. One solution is to supply potable water from seawater using desalination technology. Most conventional desalination systems are very energy intensive and use energy supplied by fossil fuels. There is a new interest to utilise low grade energy and couple a desalinator with a thermal process such as oil, gas or utility plant to produce both freshwater and power. The aim {{of this research is}} to design and evaluate a novel heat recovery system, which can cogenerate freshwater and power. Discharge thermal energy combined desalination (DTECD) with a power cycle utilises a waste heat stream as an energy source, which is available in some energy intensive plants such as ammonia or gas processing plant. DTECD includes two sub-systems: closed power cycle and open water cycle. At the core of the open water cycle is a vacuum spray flash evaporator (VSFE), which is based on low temperature thermal desalination system. The new VSFE system utilises a gas-liquid ejector to consume less energy and enable greater ease of operation compared to conventional vacuum desalinators, which use a vacuum pump or steam jet ejector. The feasibility of the proposed DTECD process was evaluated by applying the ASPEN/HYSYS V 8. 0. Two configurations of process were modelled and the results were validated based on the waste heat of two industrial case studies: ammonia and gas processing plants. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed process was evaluated by using an exergy approach, thermodynamic modelling and a thermo-economic study. The bottlenecks of the DTECD process were improved by parametric optimisation and process modification. The results revealed that the overall exergy efficiency of the proposed heat recovery system is about 50 % and this is an economic option to couple with a thermal plant. Furthermore, the core VSFE system has been designed and manufactured for the experimental study of: (i) the performance of suggested downward gas-liquid ejector (eductor), (ii) the effects of temperature and salinity of <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> on overall performance of the eductor and desalination system. Numerical models of two-phase flow, based on the thermodynamic model and transfer phenomena were applied to the VSFE system. Experimental conditions were compared with a predictive model to find its accuracy. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method, which is embedded in ANSYS/Fluent 16. 2 was undertaken to investigate the individual conversion laws inside the vessel. Based on the physics of VSFE, a discrete phase model (DPM) is needed to investigate the spray of saline water under vacuum conditions. The experimental data proved that the performance of the VSFE system is in good agreement with theoretical model and utilising a downward eductor with saline water as <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> is an economic option to generate the required vacuum. Also, the CFD results showed that the evaporation rate of the system follows the experimental data and the optimum geometry of the VSFE affects the overall performance. Finally, general aspects of working fluids in the proposed process and applications of wire mesh nozzle vs. spiral nozzle in desalinator are discussed...|$|E

Liquid ejector performance is studied experimentally when the entrained fluid is both a single-phase liquid (water) and a dual-phase liquid/gas mixture (water/air).

40|$|A novel process {{configuration}} consisting of integrating the {{air separation unit}} with a H 2 separation membrane reactor (HSMR) in a coal gasification based coproduction facility with near zero emissions is described. The plant utilizes an air separation unit operating at elevated pressure to produce an Intermediate Pressure (IP) N 2 stream {{in addition to the}} O 2 required by the coal gasifier. The syngas produced by the gasifier after cleanup is supplied to the membrane reactor which produces H 2 by shifting the carbon monoxide while simultaneously separating the fy. The IP N 2 is used as sweep gas to assist in the separation of the H 2 diffusing across the membrane walls by decreasing the partial pressure of the H 2 on the permeate side. The total pressure of gases on the permeate side may thus be increased such that the H 2 / N 2 mixture may be fed directly to the gas turbines at the required pressure without requiring cooling and compression of the HT. An added advantage is that the total pressure differential across the membrane wall is reduced. The N 2 in the fuel gas functions both as a thermal diluent for reducing the formation of nitrogen oxides and as additional <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> for expansion in the turbine. The carbon dioxide rich gas (non-permeate) leaving the membrane reactor after catalytic oxidation of the residual combustibles constitutes the carbon capture stream which may be further compressed and pipelined for CO 2 sequestration. High purity H 2 may be coproduced for export from a portion of the H 2 -N 2 stream leaving the HSMR utilizing a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit. The techno-economic advantages of such a coproduction facility are addressed. Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Operators {{of natural}} gas {{pipeline}} systems routinely reduce line pressure and discharge gas from pipeline sections to ensure safe working conditions during maintenance and repair activities. Typically, operators block the smallest possible linear section of the pipeline and depressurize it by venting gas to the atmosphere. In 2004, an estimated 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane was vented to the atmosphere during routine maintenance and pipeline upsets. Using pump-down techniques to lower gas line pressure before performing maintenance and repair activities is {{an effective way to}} reduce emissions and yield significant economic savings. Pipeline pump-down techniques involve using in-line compressors either alone or in sequence with portable compressors. Using in-line compressors is almost always justifiable because there are no capital costs, and payback is immediate. The cost-effectiveness of also using a portable compressor to increase gas recovery, however, depends greatly on site-specific factors and operating costs. Another alternative is to install an ejector. An ejector is a venturi nozzle that uses high-pressure gas as <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> to draw suction on a lower pressure gas source, discharging into an intermediate pressure gas stream. The ejector can be installed on vent connections up and down stream of a partly closed valve, or between the discharge and suction of a compressor which creates the necessary pressure differential. Regardless of the pump-down technique selected, emission reductions are directly proportional to how much pipeline pressure is reduced before venting occurs. On average, up to 90 percent of the gas in the pipeline can be recovered for sale instead of being emitted. Pipeline pump-down techniques are most economical for larger volume, higher pressure gas lines and work most effectively for planned maintenance activities and cases in which sufficient manifolding exists to connect a portable compressor. Many Natural Gas STAR Partners have realized significant economic savings by using pump-dow...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were the {{implementation}} of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{to the study of}} supersonic ejectors, and the investigation of the flow processes that occur. The conventional ejector has been in existence {{for more than a century}} yet the design has remained largely unchanged and is difficult to optimise. This has been attributed to a lack of understanding of the complex flow processes and phenomena that occur. CFD provides the ability to study these processes, and to rapidly assess geometrical influence upon operational performance. The CFD model was assessed through systematic appraisal of the numerical parameters that influence solution stability and simulation accuracy. Two proprietary CFD codes were utilised; a structured segregated code and an adaptive mesh coupled code. Assessed parameters included; mesh dependency, discretisation schemes, turbulence models, and boundary layer models that are shown highly influential. Simulation was validated through comparison of predicted and experimental entrainment values. Simulations of an ejector that is part of a steam-jet refrigeration cycle were used to assess the influence of geometry and operating conditions. The structured code was found suitable for geometrical studies however the coupled code was required for detailed flow analysis. Geometrical studies showed current ejector design guidelines to be well set. Operational studies highlighted the dominant influence of <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> flow rate upon entrainment levels. Shock systems and flow processes could be clearly identified. Simulations of ejectors utilised in vacuum and thrust augmenting applications were also conducted in assessment of the general applicability of CFD.

40|$|Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina is {{dissolving}} Pu 239 scrap, {{which is}} a legacy from the production of nuclear weapons materials, and will later convert it into oxide form to stabilize it. An eductor {{has been used to}} both dilute and transfer a plutonium containing solution between tanks. Eductors have the advantages of simplicity and no moving parts. Reliable control of dilution is important because the geometry of the receiving tank could potentially allow a nuclear criticality. Dilution factor was to have been controlled by the appropriate choice of flow restrictor in the line between the plutonium solution tank and the eductor. However, dilution factors measured for liquid transfers with different flow restrictors showed unexpected trends, causing concern that the process was not well understood. As a result, the performance of the eductor and associated piping were analyzed using a mathematical model. The one dimensional, two phase model accounted for eductor performance and for air and vapor coming out of solution at low pressures. The unexpected trends were shown {{to be the result of}} variations in viscosities and densities of both the plutonium solution and the nitric acid solution used as both the <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> and diluent. The model agreed well with existing data and was then used to make pre-test predictions of flows for four solution transfers with good agreement. This provided confidence that the eductor system was a reliable method for obtaining specified dilution factors.

Jet pumps main disadvantageousis low efficiency ranging 40 % and low pumping height which significantly limits its usage. One of the way to eliminate the low pumping height is to applying second stage of <b>motive</b> <b>fluid.</b> The other way is correct design of motive nozzles.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the application of}} Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in combination with a Volume-of-Fluid method (VOF) for the simulation of water scavenge jet pumps (WSJP) of the kind used in aircraft fuel tanks. The WSJP is operated with fuel as the primary <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> to pump sump water and offers a very complex flow difficult to investigate experimentally due to the opaqueness of the dense two-phase mixture. In an attempt to address this issue, a computational LES- VOF approach is used to investigate in detail the working of the WSJP. As part of this investigation, the current work aims {{to contribute to the}} understanding of liquid-liquid atomisation, lesser known than more common liquid-gas atomisation. In addition to providing a more accurate physical pic- ture, this work serves as a test of the LES- VOF methodology and its limitations. The LES- VOF calculations over a range of flow ratios presented confirm that for the stan- dard operational flow ratio, a mixture of fuel droplets into water is produced at the exit, contrary to the desired result of water drops in fuel dispersion. The occurrence of the water-in-fuel dispersion is shown to be more likely to occur at lower inlet flow rate ra- tios, through phase inversion. The turbulent break-up of the central fuel jet show clearly the important overlapping effects of small and large scale instabilities in the fragmen- tation process. Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using the same interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of a single fuel droplet decelerating through stagnant water, with a view towards better un- derstanding of the liquid-liquid dynamics involved in the jet pump computations, and especially the effect of grid resolution {{on the quality of the}} results. The computations provide valuable information on the physics of the process, but mostly help confirm the validity of the LES-VOF results.

40|$|Selection of {{the working}} fluid for the {{refrigeration}} or solar air-conditioning system is the crucial problem because of the strong influence of the thermodynamic fluid properties on the system efficiency. Moreover, the working fluid should fulfil the environmental criteria such as zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) and as low GWP (Greenhouse Warming Potential) as possible. Therefore the natural fluids are thought as the best option. From presented in literature analysis {{it can be concluded}} that isobutane is the best option as a working fluid for ejection system in application to air-conditioning since it offers the highest COP. Other important issue in ejection cycle analysis is the operating parameters. Thermal energy use as the motive energy for ejection cycles makes this cycle comparable with absorption system. In absorption system the temperature of the heat source tg in most cases exceeds 100 C. With decreasing of the generator (motive) temperature the efficiency of absorption system also decreases due to vanishing of the difference of strong and weak solutions concentrations. Therefore temperature tg 3 Ì†c 80 C can be considered as the minimum value at which the absorption system can still operate. In contrast, for ejection systems for most of working fluids temperature of the <b>motive</b> <b>fluid</b> at the level of 100 C is not required. Also, there is no physical limitation for operation of the ejection system at lower temperatures. Therefore the operation of the ejection cycle below tg 3 Ì†c 80 C can be considered as very attractive and in this range of the motive temperatures the ejection cycles becomes truly competitive in comparison with the absorption refrigeration systems. The paper deals with numerical analysis of operation of the ejection systems driven by low grade heat. The aim of the paper is comparison of the operating parameters of the system for natural refrigerant isobutane with other popular in air-conditioning systems refrigerant R 134 a {{and one of the most}} promising fluid from HFO group HFO 1234.

Analysis shows the promising feature of the HFO 1234 applied in ejection system. i. e. geometric similarity of ejectors designed for isobutane and HFO 1234.

In addition to pumping, the steam generator may also be used for microrocket thrust generation in micropropulsion applications. In this thesis, the design, fabrication, testing, and successful demonstration of the MEMS steam generator are presented. The device consists of a mixing section for the peroxide and catalyst streams, a reactor section where the peroxide decomposes, and finally a nozzle section where the gaseous products of the decomposition are accelerated to the required velocities. To design the device, multidomain (chemical, thermal, and fluidic) numerically-implemented modeling is used to study the underlying physics and arrive at an optimized, microfabricatable design. The modeling takes into account the key challenges of thermal management, achieving fast mixing, and boundary layer compensation. The device is then fabricated from a stack of four silicon wafers and one Pyrex wafer using deep reactive ion etching and wafer bonding. The modeling also guides the design of a micabased ceramic package which provides both thermal insulation and piping ports. The system is then experimentally tested using high-test hydrogen peroxide and ferrous chloride tetrahydrate solution as the catalyst. The overall initial peroxide mass fraction is varied between 83 % and 71 %. The device is characterized using temperature measurements, refractive index analysis, and visual inspection during operation. Successful performance is demonstrated via the full decomposition of the peroxide and the complete vaporization of the water produced. The experimental results are also compared with those from the simulation. Good agreement is observed between experiment and theory, providing comprehensive model verification. The realization and demonstration of this steam generator promise significant enhancements in MEMS technology, particularly in the fields of gas pumping and micropropulsion. by Feras Eid. Thesis (Ph.
