You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice.

25|$|After the {{military}} coup in September 1973 the Chilean national police (Carabineros) {{were incorporated into}} the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen.

25|$|Despite the {{position}} of the law, prostitutes are often treated as quasi-criminals by the Ministry of Public Security. Chinese police conduct regular patrols of public spaces, often with the support of mass-line organisations, using a strong presence as a deterrence against prostitution. Because lower tier prostitutes work the streets, {{they are more likely to}} be apprehended. Arrests are also more likely to be female sellers of sex than male buyers of sex. The overwhelming majority of <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> apprehended are released with a caution and fine.|$|E

During the daily afternoon and evening services, the hazzan alone wears a tallit. In Orthodox synagogues {{they are expected to}} be worn only by men who are halakhically Jewish and in Conservative synagogues they should be worn only by <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> halakhically Jewish.

25|$|In {{addition}} to books which present largely independent characters, certain stories feature <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> regularly partnered on adventures—often with an underlying romantic element. The Jaz Parks series, by Jennifer Rardin, follows the titular CIA operative and her vampire boss as they combat supernatural threats to national security. Jocelynn Drake's Dark Days novels follow a vampire named Mira and a vampire hunter named Danaus, who {{work together to}} protect their people from a mutual enemy. Night Huntress, a series by Jeaniene Frost, centers on a half-vampire named Catherine and a vampire bounty hunter called Bones, who gradually become lovers while battling the undead.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{not married}} {{and are not}} closely related are {{generally}} not allowed to touch each other. Many Orthodox married couples will also not touch one another in public. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex {{is said to be}} shomer negiah. Shmirath negiah applies to touching that is b'derech chiba (in an affectionate manner). According to some authorities, mainly of Modern Orthodox background, a quick handshake, particularly in the context of earning a living in a business setting, does not fall under this category. However, people who are stringently shomer negiah will avoid shaking hands with a member of the opposite sex, even in a business context. This is almost universally observed within the Haredi community, and somewhat observed within the Modern Orthodox community where the term originated in recent decades. Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{not married}} {{to each other}} and are not {{immediate}} blood relatives are not allowed to enter into a secluded situation ("yichud") in a room or in an area that is private. This measure is taken to prevent the possibility of sexual relations, which is prohibited outside of marriage. According to some authorities, this applies even between adoptive parents and adoptive children over the age of maturity, while others are more lenient with children adopted from a young age. Seclusion does not consist of merely being in a room together alone; only if the situation is private, with no one else expected to enter, does the restriction apply. Originally, this prohibition applied only to married women secluded with men other than their husbands, but it was extended to include single women. According to the Talmud, this extension occurred in the time of King David, when his son Amnon raped Absalom's sister, Tamar. On the issue of elevators, opinions vary; some allow yichud in an elevator for a time of no more than 30 seconds, while others forbid it under all circumstances, partly due to the possibility of an elevator getting stuck.|$|E
