40|$|Measles virus {{causes a}} severe {{systemic}} illness. The rash occurs simultaneously {{with the onset}} of the effector phase of the antiviral immune response and substantial evidence of immune activation. This immune response is effective in clearing virus and in establishing long-term resistance to reinfection but is associated with immune suppression, autoimmune encephalomy-elitis, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. This apparent paradox may be ex-plained in part by preferential long-term activation of type 2 CD 4 + T cells by measles virus infection.

This study aims to estimate the proportion of children aged 8  months to 6  years vaccinated on time with measles-containing vaccines (MCV) and vaccinated during the 2008 and 2010 <b>measles</b> supplementary <b>immunization</b> activities. This study also characterizes differences in mean age at vaccination and vaccination timeliness by demographic characteristics, and describes maternal knowledge of <b>measles</b> vaccination. Methods <b>Immunization</b> records were selected from {{a convenience sample of}} immunization clinics in Tianjin, China. From the records, overall vaccination coverage and timely vaccination coverage were calculated for different demographic groups. Mothers were also interviewed at these clinics to ascertain their knowledge of measles vaccination. Results Within the 329 immunization clinic records, child’s birth year and district of residence were found to be significant predictors of different measures of vaccine timeliness. Children born in 2009 had a lower age at MCV dose 2 administration (17. 96  months) than children born in 2005 (22. 00  months). Children living in Hebei, a district in the urban center of Tianjin {{were less likely to be}} vaccinated late than children living in districts further from the urban core of Tianjin. From the 31 interviews with mothers, most women believed that timely vaccination was very important and more than one dose was very necessary; most did not know whether their child needed another dose.

This paper analyzes trends in both the level and the socio-economic distribution of <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> coverage in the 1990 s for 21 developing countries with two rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys available. We examine these trends using "achievement" indices that combine trends in means and in inequality.

The results indicate that most countries have experienced an improvement in their mean <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> rate but that this improvement was often unequally distributed across wealth groups, disfavouring the poor in all countries. Mean improvements were found to be associated with both increasing and decreasing inequality. When the trend in the mean and in the degree of inequality was opposite, the trend in the overall "achievement" score is determined by the assumed underlying degree of inequality aversion. As such, the achievement measure "penalizes" coverage improvements that leave the poor lagging behind. <b>Measles</b> <b>Immunization</b> Health inequality Inequality aversion Concentration index Developing countries Poverty...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Skilled birth {{attendance}} (SBA) and <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> reflect {{two aspects}} of a health system. In Kenya, their national coverage gaps are substantial but could be largely improved if the total population had the same coverage as the wealthiest quintile.

The main objective {{of the study was to}} decompose wealth-related inequalities in SBA and <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> into their contributing factors. METHODS: Data from the Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey 2008 / 09 were used. The study investigated the effects of socio-economic determinants on [1] coverage and [2] wealth-related inequalities of SBA utilization and <b>measles</b> <b>immunization.</b> Techniques used were multivariate logistic regression and decomposition of the concentration index (C). RESULTS: SBA utilization and <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> coverage differed according to household wealth, parent's education, skilled antenatal care visits, birth order and father's occupation. SBA utilization further differed across provinces and ethnic groups. The overall C for SBA was 0. 14 and was mostly explained by wealth (40 %), parent's education (28 %), antenatal care (9 %), and province (6 %). The overall C for <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> was 0. 08 and was mostly explained by wealth (60 %), birth order (33 %), and parent's education (28 %).

This study examines cyclical and long-term trends of six vaccine-preventable diseases: pneumonia, diarrhea, meningitis, typhoid, measles, and acute viral hepatitis. Using weekly data collected between 2009 and 2015 through Afghanistan's Disease Early Warning System, we calculated monthly case counts, and fit a Poisson regression with a Fourier transformation for seasonal cycles and dummy variables for year. We found the greatest incidence of diarrhea and typhoid in the summer, pneumonia in the winter, and measles in the late spring. Meningitis and acute viral hepatitis did not demonstrate substantial seasonality. Rates of pneumonia and diarrhea were constant across years whereas rates of meningitis, typhoid, and acute viral hepatitis decreased. Measles incidence increased in 2015.

40|$|Vaccines that {{successfully}} prevent severe infant respiratory {{virus diseases}} should induce protection {{at a very}} young age because of the low age of patients who are hospitalized owing to these viruses. Candidate respiratory virus vaccines are being tested in infants who are naı̈ve to infection but seropositive to the viral agents because they possess maternal IgG antibodies (Abs). Transplacental maternal Abs may be partially protective against disease caused by respiratory virus infections. Carefully conducted studies have shown that these Abs can also profoundly suppress or enhance infant immune responses to im-munization. The mechanisms underlying regulation of immune responses to viruses by maternal Abs are under investigation.

We extend analysing immunization data to identify and determine factors influence the immunization program and immunization impact, using complex samples by SPSS 15. Of the 258, 466 households in Baseline Health Research, there is recorded 61, 843 children under 5 years old. The result extend analysis coverage of completed basic immunization in children 12 - 59 months is reported only 41. 4 % (28, 644 of 69, 189). In contrary, a high coverage is recorded in <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> (81. 3 %, 50, 278 of 61, 843). There is also significant higher proportion (5. 3 %) of measles reported in children who did not get <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> compare to children with <b>measles</b> <b>immunization</b> (3. 5 %). The risk of suffering measles with pneumonia, and measles with pneumonia and diarrhea are 2. 4 times and 2. 7 times (p   Key words : Children 12 - 59 Months, Immunization, Measles, Pneumonia, Diarrhea, Nutritional Statu...|$|E
50|$|Ethiopia's main health {{problems}} {{are said to}} be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained manpower and health facilities. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years. Only 20 percent of children nationwide have been immunized against all six vaccine-preventable diseases: tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and <b>measles.</b> Rates of <b>immunization</b> are less than 3 percent of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20 percent in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70 percent of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43 percent in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas are three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the current}} one-dose immu-nization program for measles in Canada {{has had an}} {{enormous}} impact on the inci-dence of this disease, it has failed to pre-vent the occurrence of large outbreaks in some provinces. Following a special meet-ing on measles elimination held in August 1995, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended the implementation of a routine two-dose measles vaccination schedule. NACI also recommended a special catch-up program to prevent forecasted measles outbreaks and to achieve earlier elimination of measles. 1 As of April 1, 1996, six provinces and territories had officially announced their measles mass catch-up campaigns and some had already begun them. In order to promote this initiative to the parents, vari-ous information materials were developed at the local, provincial and federal levels. These ranged from TV advertisements to an information leaflet sent to all parents of school-aged children. In Ontario, the cam-paign targeted school-aged children and took place from February 1 to June 30, 1996. In BC, the campaign was also extended to preschoolers * and lasted from April 1 to June 30, 1996. The objective of the survey was to evalu-ate the impact of the promotional materi-als aimed at parents of children targeted during the <b>measles</b> mass <b>immunization</b> campaign in Ontario and BC...|$|R
40|$|In October 1994, a {{retrospective}} study of mortality of children {{was conducted in}} Maringué, a district of central Mozambique. Estimates based on maternity histories of 1503 women aged 15 - 60 years revealed complex changes in the under- 5 death rate. During the colonial period (1955 - 1974), mortality declined from 373 to 270 per 1000. During the civil war period (1975 - 1991), mortality increased rapidly to reach a peak of 473 per 1000 in 1986. It declined again thereafter and reached a plateau of 380 in 1991. A health intervention conducted by the International Red Cross Committee since 1992 further reduced mortality to 269 per 1000 in 1994. Most of the 1992 - 1994 decline was attributable to vaccinations, in particular <b>measles</b> and tetanus <b>immunizations,</b> and to Vitamin A supplementation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
