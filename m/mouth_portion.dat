2500|$|FBI latent-print {{examiner}} Elizabeth Fontaine {{testified that}} adhesive {{in the shape}} of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the <b>mouth</b> <b>portion</b> of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." [...] During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, [...] "It was no longer visible." [...] She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.|$|E

40|$|When any nerve gets injured {{around the}} <b>mouth</b> <b>portion</b> then it results into mouth paralysis. For the {{movement}} of paralyzed portion of the lips this device is designed. There are two steps for giving movement to disable portion. One is taking EMG and other is controlling a hardware through servo motor. System initiates at 5 V power supply. By placing electrodes on the strongest nerve EMG signal is taken from working part of lips {{with the help of}} electromyograph electrodes. Two electrodes are used here on the either sides of the lip corner, we can add more electrodes if needed. To read the strength of the signal LCD id placed. This EMG signal is given to instrumentation amplifier on EMG amplification board to make is strong signal. Then it is given to filter to eliminate noise and then rectifier makes it D. C. Again smoothing circuit is there to make it smooth DC from pulsating D. C. then applying it on aurduino uno analog signal is converted into digital signal. This digital signal drives the servomotor to move the paralyzed potion of lips on hardware module...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- As {{field of}} signal {{processing}} is widening in various {{security and surveillance}} applications, motivated the interest for implementing better application with less complications. A non-intrusive machine vision based concepts is used to simulate Drowsiness Detection System. The system is consisting of web camera which placed {{in a way that}} it records driver’s head movements in order to detect drowsiness. As drowsiness is detected, a signal is issued to alert the driver. The system deals with detecting face, eyes and mouth within the specific segment of the image. All the possible actions have been considered and output is generated accordingly. Drowsiness is determined by observing the eye blinking action of the driver. Other than drowsiness, driver’s attention while driving is also considered. The proposed algorithm is developed to minimize the complexity level from existing system while efficiency has given prime importance which was a main objective of the paper. The system is implemented using cascade object identifier from vision toolbox of Matlab, which detects face, eyes, nose and mouth from the image which is captured from web camera. For this system Region of Interest is location of eyes and mouth which are determined and indicated by rectangle. Logic has been used here to identify whether eyes are open or closed unlike general methods. From <b>mouth</b> <b>portion</b> yawning is determined and considered. Project is simulated for on line and off line video with all possible situations of a driver. Results are formulated under different categories like normal driver, driver with glass under different light intensities. It is concluded that proposed system can also be utilized for other application. Results obtained from the proposed system provide efficient system analysis and overall good efficiency with some precautions by using simple flow of programming...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{deals with the}} implementation of face recognition using neural network (recognition classifier) on multi-scale features of face (such as eyes, nose, <b>mouth</b> and remaining <b>portions</b> of face). The proposed system contains three parts, preprocessing, multi scale feature extraction and face classification using neural network. The basic idea of the proposed method is to construct facial features from multi-scale image patches for different face components. The multi-scale features of face (such as Eyes, Nose, <b>Mouth</b> and remaining <b>portion</b> of face) becomes the input to neural network classifier, which uses back propagation, algorithm and radial function network to recognize familiar faces (trained) and faces with variations in expressions, illumination changes, tilt of 5 to 10 degrees and with spects. The crux of proposed algorithm is its beauty to use single neural network as classifier, which produces straight forward approach towards face recognition. The proposed algorithm was tested on FERET face data base for 200 images of 40 subjects (120 faces for training 80 for testing) and results are encouraging compared to other face recognition techniques.

5000|$|The city of Kenai {{is named}} after the local Dena'ina (Tanaina) word 'ken' or 'kena', which means 'flat, meadow, open area with few trees; base, low ridge', {{according}} to the Dena'ina Topical Dictionary by James Kari, Ph.D., published in 2007. This describes the area along the <b>mouth</b> and <b>portion</b> of the Kenai River near the City of Kenai. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} area was first occupied by the Kachemak people from 1000 B.C., until they were displaced by the Dena'ina Athabaskan people around 1000 A.D. Before the arrival of the Russians, Kenai was a Dena'ina village called Shk'ituk't, meaning [...] "where we slide down." [...] When Russian fur traders first arrived in 1741, about 1,000 Dena'ina lived in the village. The traders called the people [...] "Kenaitze", which is a Russian term for [...] "people of the flats", or [...] "Kenai people".

The water power of this town consists of a series of falls on the Machias River, at the head of navigation, six miles (10 km) above the river's mouth, and three above its junction with the East Machias River. The gross power of the falls is that of about 937 horses.|$|R
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the <b>mouth.</b> The bottom <b>portion</b> of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|R

Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|R
50|$|US 60 had its {{beginnings}} in the Midland Trail, an auto trail organized in 1912 by residents of Grand Junction, Colorado. The next year, this route was considered but rejected for the Lincoln Highway, {{after which the}} Midland Trail Association laid out and marked its own transcontinental highway, eventually connecting Newport News, Virginia with Los Angeles, California. When the Joint Board on Interstate Highways published its preliminary plan for a system of interstate routes in 1925, the Midland Trail was split among many numbers, including 52, 62, 150, 50, and 40. East of Louisville, where it would become US 60, it was assigned parts of 52 and 62. Route 52 began at Newport News and followed the Midland Trail to Richmond, but took a more southerly route to Lexington, Virginia. The trail was used again through West Virginia to Huntington, where Route 52 split to the northwest. Route 62 began at Ashland, Kentucky (near Huntington) and followed the Midland Trail across northeastern Kentucky to Louisville, where the trail crossed the Ohio River and became Route 150. Route 62 continued southwest along the south bank of the Ohio River to Wickliffe in western Kentucky, and then crossed the Mississippi River at the Ohio's <b>mouth.</b> The final <b>portion</b> of Route 62 crossed southern Missouri to Springfield on an existing main highway that had been numbered 16 by the state.|$|R
40|$|Rivers {{transport}} water, sediment, {{and other}} constituents from the continent to the sea, but in route material can often become stored temporarily or permanently. Along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, coastal plain rivers {{such as the}} Tar River are characterized as low-gradient meandering systems that develop wide floodplains which are subjected to frequent and prolonged flooding. As a result, these rivers are believed to experience storage of sediment, particularly near their estuarine <b>mouths.</b> The lower <b>portion</b> of rivers and their attached estuaries are also environmentally and economically important serving as critical habitat (e. g., nurseries for fish), recreational areas, and transportation pathways. Excess sediment is often considered a significant pollutant and can have adverse effects on biota. Suspended sediment also can supply excess nutrients and trace metals from anthropogenic activity.   Previous work in North Carolina suggests that alluvial storage can make up the majority (> 50 %) of the total sediment delivered to rivers. This study more closely examines the nature of lower floodplain sediment storage and more specifically focuses on calculating sediment accumulation along the Tar River. Cores were collected from three sites along seven different transects perpendicular to the main channel. Analysis of 210 Pb and 137 Cs were employed to calculate sediment accumulation rates, and grain-size data were made to inform radionuclide and sedimentation interpretations. Sedimentation rates within the study area range from 0. 09 to 1. 08 cm/yr. However, several sites appear to have non-steady-state deposition possibly due to major overbank flood events. Grain-size data indicate a mixture of sand and mud at all sites with some variability {{in the nature of}} sediment accumulating. Using core observations and LiDAR topographic data, storage across the system is estimated to be approximately 1. 26 x 105 t/yr or roughly 66 % of the total incoming sediment measured at Tarboro, NC (1. 89 x 105 t/yr) in previous works.   M.
