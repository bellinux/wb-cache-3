Lindisfarne NNR has international recognition and covers a large and varied mosaic of internationally recognised and important coastal habitats. These include intertidal mudflats, rocky shore, sand dunes and salt marshes. The dunes of the Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve support many plants. Early forget-me-nots and marram grass are among those that hug the ground and need little water. Many species of insects, moths, and butterflies appreciate this environment, including the 'woolly bears' (tiger moth caterpillars). Dark green fritillary, and grayling butterflies bask in the sun during July and August in the Lindisfarne NNR. Big brown-lipped snails can also be found. During early summer, the purple northern marsh orchid flourishes along with its pinker relation, the early marsh orchid. In July the <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborines</b> flower by the thousands and form spectacular white carpets. [...] Recently a unique orchid, the Lindisfarne helleborine, has been discovered on the island. The plants were formerly identified as dune helleborine (Epipactis dunensis), but DNA analysis carried out in 2003 revealed them to be genetically distinct, and the new species was given the scientific name Epipactis sancta.|$|R

50|$|Epipactis palustris (<b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine)</b> is an orchid {{native to}} Europe, Turkey, north Iraq, the Caucasus, north Iran, West and East Siberia and Central Asia. This species {{occurs in the}} Sarmatic mixed forests ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|This {{site was}} taken over by wet {{woodland}} in the twentieth century, but the Trust has restored the eastern end to fen by mowing, and it has many typical fen plants such as <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine,</b> marsh fragrant orchid and sawsedge.|$|E
50|$|Several {{scarce and}} notable species occur {{including}} Round-headed Rampion (Phyteuma tenerum), Bastard-toadflax (Thesium humifusum), Fly Orchid (Ophrys insectifera), Fragrant Orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), Lesser Butterfly Orchid (Platanthera bifolia), Frog orchid(Coeloglossum viride), Musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) and unusually, for a downland site, <b>Marsh</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Epipactis palustris).|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} plants {{associated}} with alkaline soils grow on the site including fragrant orchid, <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine,</b> ploughman's spikenard, and yellow-wort. It is a stronghold for the dingy skipper butterfly. A variety of ducks, waders, and other waterbirds occur and numerous rarities have been recorded such as broad-billed sandpiper, stilt sandpiper, Caspian tern, and whiskered tern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>Helleborine</b> occurs {{here and}} {{nowhere else in}} Avon. Lesser Butterfly-orchid and Fragrant Orchid also occur here, and at only one other Avon site each. It {{is also home to}} Yellow Rattle, Meadow Sweet and Meadow Thistle. The reserve is also {{important}} for its invertebrate interest and is home to many species of moth, grasshopper and dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been studied by botanists since the 17th century and {{attracted}} particular interest in the Victorian era. More than 300 species of vascular plants have been recorded in the area, though {{some of them have}} not been found in recent years. Rare plants include grass-of-Parnassus and <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchid, which are on the Red List of Threatened Species compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Other orchids {{that are}} to be found in Rospuda Valley include: the western marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis), lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus), early coralroot (Corallorrhiza trifida), the common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), Pugsley's marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza traunsteineri), <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis palustris), fen orchid (Liparis loeselii). In Rospuda Valley there are also other rare and {{protected}} plants including: dwarf birch (Betula humilis), Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum), English sundew (Drosera anglica), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), Turk's cap lily (Lilium martagon) etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep slopes}} at Tissø's {{northern}} end {{is also to}} be protected. Here sunloving plants like small pasque flower, sunrose and dwarf everlast are found, with the rare and threatened fragrant scabious in between. The meadows below the cliffs are also of botanical interest, supporting plants like marsh lousewort, bog-star and various true sedges like blue sedge along with orchids like early marsh orchid, western marsh orchid and <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine,</b> in a biotope of calcium-rich springs.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} hardy orchids grow in a wet environment, {{but there are}} exceptions. The <b>Marsh</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis palustris) is the only European orchid able {{to survive in a}} flooded habitat. Epipactis gigantea is a species found in the American west, and into {{southern}} Canada, in wet areas and even streams. It can grow to a height of 1 m. However, Epipactis helleborine grows in more diverse habitats, from sheltered sandy beaches to open spaces in deciduous or coniferous forests, on roadsides, in meadows, and on moist soils. It is sometimes called the Weed Orchid.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} also home to many species of plants {{including}} the bee orchid, pyramidal orchid, <b>Marsh</b> <b>Helleborine,</b> Bee orchid and common spotted orchids. There is an Interpretative Centre {{at the end of the}} causeway on the right hand side which has displays and information on the flora and fauna of the island, and there are also information signs to either side of the causeway access, and on the roundabout where the causeway road approaches the beach. The Centre was opened in 1986 and provides a base for many schools and educational groups to visit the Island. It was funded by the European Commission and the Dublin Rotary Club.|$|E
50|$|Viidumäre {{nature reserve}} {{consists}} mostly of pine- and oak-forest, complemented with meadows, bogs and traditionally utilised wooded meadows. The nature reserve {{is located in}} the west of Saaremaa, on the oldest and highest lying part of the island. The nature reserve is important for its great biodiversity. As regards to the flora, the nature reserve is home to the Rhinanthus osiliensis, a species of rattle which can only be found on Saaremaa and Gotland islands in the Baltic Sea. Other notable species include red helleborine, <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine,</b> Kashubian vetch and rock whitebeam. The bird life is rich with species like black woodpecker, Eurasian pygmy owl, black stork and white-tailed eagle as typical representatives. Mammals such as elk and wild boar are frequent in the area. Facilities for visitors include bird watching towers, hiking trails with information boards and a visitor centre.|$|E
50|$|In {{and around}} the lake there are 191 plant species, out of which 14 are protected. Since 1865, when Josif Pančić found the first specimen, 30 species of orchids have been {{registered}} on {{the territory of the}} City of Belgrade. Two of them can be found only in Veliko Blato. One is <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis palustris (L.) Cr.), with some 200 individual plants. It grows only up to 20 m from the canal which encircles the lake. It was discovered near the lake in 2012. The other, with only some 50 specimens, is Orchis palustris Jacq. It grows between the turfs of grass where the water has dug minute canals. It was spotted {{for the first time in}} Belgrade in 1896 on the Great War Island, but was never seen again there. It has been re-discovered in the Makiš area in 1955, but by 2001 it disappeared, too.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} lies close to Sandemar Castle and the {{landscape}} is characterised by having {{been part of the}} manorial estate for a long time. The area is considered {{to be one of the}} foremost examples in Stockholm County of such a landscape. It includes coastal meadows rich in bird-life and a rich fen situated in the eastern part of the reserve. The fen is regularly tended to in order to preserve its special flora and fauna, which includes early marsh orchid, fen orchid, <b>marsh</b> <b>helleborine</b> and the carnivorous common butterwort. The coastal meadows contain stands of elder-flowered orchid and Fritillaria meleagris, and the flat meadows and shallow water is also an important habitat for birds. For the convenience of visitors, a bird watching tower has been built not far from the water's edge. The nature reserve is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network.|$|E
