40|$|Abstract. <b>Multidisciplinary</b> <b>conferences</b> in {{hospitals}} are becoming an everyday part of health service delivery and being recommended {{as a mechanism}} for en-suring quality patient care and management. This paper reports preliminary findings of an ethnographic study of Clinical Pathology Conferences with Res-piratory teams.

The findings so far suggest that collaborative technologies {{have the potential to}} improve the effectiveness of clinical confer-ence activity. Time, location and missing artefacts are identified as being issues as well as the coordination of the series of events associated with patient inves-tigative and assessment procedures. The implications of recording data and in-teractions at the conference are also being investigated. ...|$|R

50|$|However, {{problematic}} {{aspects of}} the original Gleason grading system still characterize the 2005 revision. The predominant lowest score assigned is Gleason 3+3 = 6. Patients who are told their Gleason score is 6 out of 10 may interpret {{that they have a}} more aggressive intermediate cancer and experience greater anxiety. More importantly, some classification systems fail to clearly distinguish between Gleason 3+4 = 7 and Gleason 4+3 = 7, with the latter having a worse prognosis. Therefore, in 2014 an international <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>conference</b> convened to revise the 2005 system. A 5-point Gleason Grade grouping similar to those such as PI-RADS used with prostate MRI evaluations was proposed to denote prognostically distinct stratification. The number 1 would indicate the lowest-risk cancer while 5 would indicate the most aggressive disease. The system was tested and validated against 20,000 prostatectomy specimens and at least 16,000 biopsy samples. The majority of conference participants concurred on the superiority of the scale over the 2005 Gleason grading system, pointing to the likelihood that overtreatment could be avoided for patients whose cancer was assigned a 1. The World Health Organization's 2016 edition of Pathology and Genetics: Tumours of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs has accepted the 2014 system, which can be used in conjunction with the 2005 Gleason system.|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether <b>multidisciplinary</b> case <b>conference</b> reviews improved outcomes for nursing home residents, {{and the effects of}} this team approach to resident care on carers, including the hands-on carers employed by the nursing home, and health professionals. Method: 245 residents of three Canberra nursing homes were enrolled in this non-randomised controlled trial. The intervention consisted of sessions of three case conference reviews held between 10 / 4 / 96 and 4 / 12 / 96. These sessions were attended by the General Practitioners (GPs) of the residents discussed, the GP project officer from the ACT Division of General Practice, a clinical pharmacist, senior nursing staff, other health professionals eg physiotherapist, and occasionally the resident concerned or their representative. At each review, a case presentation by the resident 2 ̆ 7 s GP was followed by a multidisciplinary discussion of all aspects, medical and non-medical, of the resident 2 ̆ 7 s care. The review concluded with a management plan for the resident. In total 75 residents were reviewed. Main outcome measures: Medication use and cost, and mortality. Results: One month after the reviews were completed comparisons between those who were reviewed and those who were not showed non-significant reductions in medication orders, medication cost, and mortality in the reviewed group. Many of the 92 recommendations in the management plans that were carried out benefited the residents (n= 37) and/or carers (n= 24). The responses of the GPs and the Directors of Nursing to the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Conclusion: Recommendations arising from <b>multidisciplinary</b> case <b>conferences</b> were carried out to the benefit of patients and carers.

40|$|This review {{will make}} {{familiar}} with new concepts in ovarian cancer {{and their impact}} on radiological practice. Disseminated peritoneal spread and ascites are typical of the most common (70 – 80 %) cancer type, highgrade serous ovarian cancer. Other cancer subtypes differ in origin, precursors, and imaging features. Expert sonography allows excellent risk assessment in adnexal masses. Owing to its high specificity, complementary MRI improves characterization of indeterminate lesions. Major changes in the new FIGO staging classification include fusion of fallopian tube and primary ovarian cancer and the subcategory stage IIIA 1 for retroperitoneal lymph node metastases only. Inguinal lymph nodes, cardiophrenic lymph nodes, and umbilical metastases are classified as distant metastases (stage IVB). In <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>conferences</b> (MDC), CT has been used to predict the success of cytoreductive surgery. Resectability criteria have to be specified and agreed on in MDC.
