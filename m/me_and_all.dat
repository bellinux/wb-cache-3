25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than I have ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
500|$|Ironically, {{the least}} self-confident {{performer}} {{in the film}} {{was one of the}} few professional actors: Vladimir Pucholt, who played the pianist. According to Forman: [...] "This great actor, who had tremendous artistic intuition, completely mistrusted his talent. I think this was because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see, much less measure, the result of his acting. 'Was it good, Mr. Forman?” he asked me after every perfect shot. 'It was excellent!' 'Really?' 'Really.' He never believed <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> of us loved him.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{as part of}} a new storyline, Sable was {{attacked}} by a masked woman named Spider Lady, {{who turned out to be}} Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a Strap match at the Royal Rumble after an assist from a planted female Sable fan, WWF newcomer Tori. Tori's debut signified a change in Sable's persona. After the Rumble, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of Playboy. The issue was one of the highest selling issues of Playboy ever. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned heel by [...] "going Hollywood" [...] and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned face). She debuted a new catchphrase: [...] "This is for all the women who want to be <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> the men who come to see me" [...] and a dance move called [...] "the grind." [...] The feud with Tori led to a match at WrestleMania XV. During the contest, Nicole Bass debuted as Sable's bodyguard and helped Sable win the match.|$|E

In [...] "Two Words for Signor Felice Romani" [...] , he states {{that it is not}} his {{intention}} to defend the composer but [...] "only to vent my displeasure given <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> sensitive people by the very sarcastic manner, full of personal rancor and hauteur, with which Signor Romani has undertaken to assail his antagonist." [...] Not unexpectedly, a further [...] "cannonade" [...] (says Weinstock) appeared from Romani, published this time in L'Eco on 12 April 1833 with both an editor's preface, decrying the poor taste displayed by both sides, and a brief final response from Marinetti.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her face with her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, {{recognizing}} his financial embarrassment, Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: [...] "The jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money, you so generously lend <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.|$|E

The song finds Swift {{playing with the}} idea of colors in {{relation}} to her emotions about a relationship. Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact that some things are just hard to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that means to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E

This is intended to convey pure fear, the imminent threat of annihilation. The evil demigod is preceded by a black cloud, which appears above {{the heads of the}} sailors. Expressing the surprise he experiences, Gama quotes himself: [...] "Oh divine power – [...] said – sublimated, / what divine threat or what secret / this clime and this sea presents to us / that seems a bigger thing than a storm?" [...] ("Ó potestade – disse – sublimada, / que ameaço divino ou que segredo / este clima e este mar nos apresenta, / que mor cousa parece que tormenta?") The [...] "strange Colossus" [...] ("estranhíssimo Colosso"): [...] "Rude son of the Earth" [...] ("Filho aspérrimo da Terra") is described as having: [...] "huge stature", [...] "squalid beard", [...] "earthy colour", [...] "full of earth and crinkly of hairs / blacken the mouth, yellow the teeth"("disforme estatura", [...] "barba esquálida", [...] "cor terrena", [...] "cheios de terra e crespos os cabelos / a boca negra, os dentes, amarelos").|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} to London, {{where he was}} diagnosed with an inoperable prostate cancer, which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. [...] "Great loss for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> of us," [...] he wrote. [...] "Greater than I would have thought." [...] He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with G. H. von Wright; to London to stay with Rush Rhees; then to Oxford to see Elizabeth Anscombe, writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then {{returned to}} Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into Storey's End at 76 Storey's Way, the home of his doctor, Edward Bevan, and his wife Joan; he had told them {{he did not want to}} die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, [...] "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does." [...] In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
