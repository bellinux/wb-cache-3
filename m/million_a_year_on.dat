5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>on</b> labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E

Many consultants are contributors to the Harvard Business Review. McKinsey consultants published only two books from 1960-1980, then more than 50 from 1980 to 1996.

2500|$|One of the Paris Declaration's {{priorities}} is {{to reduce}} systems of aid that are [...] "parallel" [...] to local systems. For example, Oxfam reported that, in Mozambique, donors are spending $350 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>on</b> 3,500 technical consultants, which is enough to hire 400,000 local civil servants, weakening local capacity. [...] Between 2005 and 2007, the number of parallel systems did fall, by about 10% in 33 countries. In order to improve coordination and reduce parallel systems, the Paris Declaration suggests that aid recipient countries lay down a set of national development priorities and that aid donors fit in with those plans.|$|E
2500|$|The New Voice {{political}} platform persuaded many unions {{to abandon the}} status quo. Sweeney called for a major expansion of the federation's role in organizing by: spending $20 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>on</b> hiring and training thousands of new organizers; mobilizing over 1,000 college students for summer organizing; creating a [...] "Sunbelt Organizing Fund" [...] to sponsor organizing in the South and Southwest; and establishing a separate Organizing Department.

Sweeney also called for a modification of labor's political tactics and withdrawal of support for Democrats who did not support labor's agenda. Sweeney recommended creating a National Labor Political Training Center to recruit and train candidates and political campaign directors, and establishing a Labor Center for Economic and Public Policy that would develop policy analysis, support the federation's legislative agenda and expand the political activities of the state federations and central labor councils.|$|E
