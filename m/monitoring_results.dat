25|$|The current gold {{standard}} for diagnosis of GERD is esophageal pH monitoring. It is the most objective test to diagnose the reflux disease and allows monitoring GERD patients in their response to medical or surgical treatment. One practice for diagnosis of GERD is a short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors, with improvement in symptoms suggesting a positive diagnosis. Short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors may help predict abnormal 24-hr pH <b>monitoring</b> <b>results</b> among patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD.|$|E
25|$|Air {{quality in}} much of BC is good {{compared}} to many areas of North America. This is particularly true for cities in BC such as the Greater Vancouver area and Victoria, British Columbia. Valley communities (e.g. Golden) may experience periods of poor air quality, particularly during stagnant atmospheric conditions. Two communities currently exceed the federal air quality standards; Prince George for particulate matter (PM2.5) and the community of Hope (in the Lower Fraser Valley) for ozone. Other communities {{are close to the}} PM2.5 standard, such as Quesnel and Kamloops. Communities close to exceeding the standard for ozone include Chiliwack, Langley, Kamloops and others. Hourly air quality <b>monitoring</b> <b>results</b> are available for the Lower Fraser Valley. Air quality information is available {{for the rest of the}} province from the Ministry of the Environment. The BC Lung Association produces an annual State of the Air Report for BC. This report is a collaboration between the provincial, federal and regional governments responsible for air quality management in BC.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Bill Williams River, flowing {{downstream}} of Alamo Dam, {{is one of}} {{the rivers}} featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project. [...] Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam. [...] Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define [...] [...] While not all of the recommended environmental flow components could be implemented immediately, the USACE has changed its operations of Alamo Dam to incorporate more natural low flows and controlled floods. Ongoing monitoring is capturing resulting ecological responses such as rejuvenation of native willow-cottonwood forest, suppression of invasive and non-native tamarisk, restoration of more natural densities of beaver dams and associated lotic-lentic habitat, changes in aquatic insect populations, and enhanced groundwater recharge. USACE engineers continue to consult with scientists on a regular basis and use the <b>monitoring</b> <b>results</b> to further refine operations of the dam.|$|E
