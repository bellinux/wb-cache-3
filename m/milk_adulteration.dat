5000|$|Because of poor animal husbandry, {{production}} and storage {{and the demand}} for milk far outstripping supplies, the use of other potentially harmful chemical additives such as preservatives and hydrogen peroxide has been reported by independent media as being commonplace. Quality tests can be falsified with additives: peroxide is added to prevent milk going bad; industrial vegetable oil is emulsified and added to boost fat levels; whey is used to increase lactose content. However, the procurement chain is also implicated, as milk agents are often politically well-connected. Farmers report salespeople had, for years, been visiting farms in dairy areas hawking [...] "protein powder" [...] additives, which would often be delivered in unmarked brown paper bags of 25 kg each. A new version of [...] "protein powder", capable of fooling dairies as to protein content, started being peddled approximately two years ago.

Subsequently CGSI did tests on electrical appliances and fittings - irons, immersion heaters, culminating in the enactment of the Household Electrical Appliances (Quality Control) Order. CGSI has developed a food adulteration testing kit and a <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> testing kit for use by the lay consumers.

Here we sought to develop an {{easy to use and}} robust method for species identification in cheese with emphasis on an authenticity control of PDO Feta cheese products. We used specific mitochondrial DNA regions coupled with high resolution melting (HRM) a closed-tube method allowing us to detect bovine, ovine and caprine species and authenticate Greek PDO Feta cheese. The primers successfully amplified DNA isolated from milk and cheese and showed a high degree of specificity. HRM was proven capable of accurately identifying the presence of bovine milk (not allowed in Feta) down to 0. 1 % and also of quantifying the ratio of sheep to goat milk mixture in different Feta cheese commercial products.

Current analytical methods {{for the detection of}} <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> are slow, laborious, and therefore impractical for use in routine milk screening by the dairy industry. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a rapid biochemical fingerprinting technique {{that could be used to}} reduce this sample analysis period significantly. To test this hypothesis we investigated 3 types of milk: cow, goat, and sheep milk. From these, 4 mixtures were prepared. The first 3 were binary mixtures of sheep and cow milk, goat and cow milk, or sheep and goat milk; in all mixtures the mixtures contained between 0 and 100 % of each milk in increments of 5 %. The fourth combination was a tertiary mixture containing sheep, cow, and goat milk also in increments of 5 %. Analysis by FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical methods, including partial least squares (PLS) regression and nonlinear kernel partial least squares (KPLS) regression, were used for multivariate calibration to quantify the different levels of adulterated milk. The FT-IR spectra showed a reasonably good predictive value for the binary mixtures, with an error level of 6. 5 to 8 % when analyzed using PLS. The results improved and excellent predictions were achieved (only 4 – 6 % error) when KPLS was employed. Excellent predictions were achieved by both PLS and KPLS with errors of 3. 4 to 4. 9 % and 3. 9 to 6. 4 %, respectively, when the tertiary mixtures were analyzed.

These tests were subsequently used for quantification of cow milk in commercial "Bryndza". Raw sheep milk, cow milk and heat-treated cow milk (pasteurisation at 72 °C for 15 sec or at 85 °C for 3 sec) were mixed in precisely defined proportions (0 - 100 % cow milk in sheep milk). The milk mixtures were sampled to detect adulteration and subsequently cheese was made. By ELISA tests was possible to determine these amounts of raw cow milk in sheep milk: 0. 5 % (0. 2 %), 5 % (4. 81 %), 50 % (42. 08 %) and 75 % (56. 52 %). The pasteurized samples in different combinations gave lower optical density responses than those prepared from raw milk (by approximately 60 %). In context with the above mentioned, the relationship between the real and detected amount of cow milk (%) in different production stages (milk, cheese) using a regression analysis was examined. However, a lower reliability of the detection was indicated by R 2 values, which ranged from 0. 4058 (cheese) to 0. 5175 (milk). In practice this means that although individual percentage (%) of cow milk in the sample can be detected, but in the unknown sample it can not be clearly confirm whether the cow milk was raw or heat-treated. In this context, the results can be inaccurate and may not correspond to the real situation.

The abundance ratio of the ions at m/z 703 and m/z 706 was found to be species-correlated and was used as marker of cows’ milk in sheep’s and goats’ milk. Furthermore, the procedure could potentially be applied to cheese samples, because peaks at m/z 703 and 706 were also found in several commercial cheese samples. This approach proved to be an efficient, rapid, and inexpensive method of detecting milk fraud...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} tongue with 36 cross-sensibility sensors {{was built}} allowing a successful {{recognition of the}} five basic taste standards, showing high sensibility to acid, salty and umami taste substances and lower performance to bitter and sweet tastes. The taste recognition capability was afterwards tested in the detection of goat <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> with bovine milk, which {{is a problem for}} the dairy industry. This new methodology is an alternative to the classical analyticalmethods used to detect caprine milk adulterations with bovine milk, being a simpler, faster and economical procedure. The different signal profiles recorded by the e-tongue device together with linear discriminant analysis allowed the implementation of a model that could distinguish between rawskim milk groups (goat, cowand goat/cow) with an overall sensibility and specificity of 97 % and 93 %, respectively. Furthermore, cross-validation showed that the modelwas able to correct classify unknown milk samples with a sensibility and specificity of 87 % and 70 %, respectively. Additionally, the model robustness was confirmed since it correctly or incorrectly classified milk samples with, respectively, higher and lower probabilities than those that could be expected by chance.

40|$|Milk is an {{important}} nutritious component of our diet consumed by most humans on a daily basis. Microbiological spoilage affects its safe use and consumption, its organoleptic properties and is {{a major part of}} its quality control process. European Union legislation and the Hazard Analysis and the Critical Control Point (HACCP) system in the dairy industry are therefore in place to maintain both the safety and the quality of milk production in the dairy industry. A main limitation of currently used methods of milk spoilage detection in the dairy industry is the time-consuming and sometimes laborious turnover of results. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and high throughput (HT) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy metabolic fingerprinting techniques were investigated for their speed and accuracy in the enumeration of viable bacteria in fresh pasteurized cows' milk. Data analysis was performed using principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical techniques. Accurate viable microbial loads were rapidly obtained after minimal sample preparation, especially when FTIR was combined with PLS, making it a promising technique for routine use by the dairy industry. FTIR and Raman spectroscopies in combination with multivariate techniques were also explored as rapid detection and enumeration techniques of S. aureus, a common milk pathogen, and Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris, a common lactic acid bacterium (LAB) and potential antagonist of S. aureus, in ultra-heat treatment milk. In addition, the potential growth interaction between the two organisms was investigated. FTIR spectroscopy in combination with PLS and kernel PLS (KPLS) appeared to have the greatest potential with good discrimination and enumeration attributes for the two bacterial species even when in co-culture without previous separation. Furthermore, it was shown that the metabolic effect of L. cremoris predominates when in co-culture with S. aureus in milk but with minimal converse growth interaction between the two microorganisms and therefore potential implications in the manufacture of dairy products using LAB. The widespread and high consumption of milk make it a target for potential financial gain through adulteration with cheaper products reducing quality, breaking labeling and patent laws and potentially leading to dire health consequences. The time consuming and laborious nature of currently used analytical techniques in milk authentication enabled the study of FTIR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) as rapid analytical techniques in quantification of <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration,</b> using binary and tertiary fresh whole cows', goats' and sheep's milk mixture samples. Chemometric data analysis was performed using PLS and KPLS multivariate analyses. Overall, results indicated that both techniques have excellent enumeration and detection attributes for use in <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> with good prospects for potential use in the dairy industry.

40|$|The {{adulteration}} of protein-based {{food products}} with melamine {{is now a}} well-known issue. Five years ago, {{the increasing number of}} renal failures in dogs and cats alerted the authorities to a problem in the pet food supply chain. We now know this was due to the mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid found inside pet food 1. These chemicals were introduced into the pet food in China by food ingredient producers with the intent to exploit the long-standing system of payment for ingredients. Rather than payment by weight, which was often exploited throughout history, the food industry for the last 100 years has paid ingredient suppliers based on nutritional parameters such as protein or fat. Protein content is invariably quantified using either the Kjeldahl wet chemistry or Dumas combustion methods. These industry-standard tests for protein content measure nitrogen and correlate the result to protein. This means that adding high nitrogen content compounds to protein-containing foods generates a higher protein content reading and hence a higher price. In the case of the 2008 <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> scandal, the additional melamine allowed further dilution of the milk to give a consistent protein reading, increasing profits dishonestly 2. The reason why this case was higher profile, however, was that it directly affected the human food supply chain as melamine-laced infant formula killed a number of babies and hospitalized a greater number...|$|E
40|$|Available online 17 May 2016 Serra da Estrela Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) {{cheese is}} the most famous Portuguese cheese and has a high {{commercial}} value. However, the adulteration of production with cheaper/lower-quality milks from non-autochthones ovine breeds compromises {{the quality of the}} final product and undervalues the original PDO cheese. A Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method was developed for efficient detection of adulterant breeds in milk mixtures used for fraudulent production of this cheese. Furthermore, Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) markers were designed envisioning the detection of <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> in processed dairy foods. The RAPD-SCAR technique is here described, for the first time, to be potentially useful for detection of milk origin in dairy products. In this sense, our findings will play an important role on the valorization of Serra da Estrela cheese, as well as on other high-quality dairy products prone to adulteration, contributing to the further development of the dairy industry.

40|$|The recent {{emerging}} {{and burning}} issue of milk is its adulteration. Adulteration is practiced either to substitute the cheaper ingredients or {{to impress the}} buyer to think the product is more valuable or of better quality. Keeping in view of this issue a small work was planned to detect the adulteration in milk. A total of 50 samples were collected from retail outlets, nearby chilling centres and different localities in and around Proddatur of YSR Kadapa District, Andhrapradesh, India and tested for the determination of and extent of adulteration. Qualitative analyses were carried out on 50 milk samples {{with the help of}} a standard <b>milk</b> <b>adulteration</b> kit manufactured by HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India. The results indicates that out of 50 samples 54 % and 40 % of the samples were adulterated with Sodium chloride and Sugar respectively. The presence of Urea and Hydrogen peroxide was nearly same (24 % and 26 % respectively). To little extent the milk was also adulterated with Formalin (12 %), Glucose / Dextrose and Detergents (10 %), Starch (8 %), Neutralizers (6 %) and Skim milk powder (2 %). All percentage values are indicative of presence of these adulterants. The findings of this study prooved that the milk procured did not confirm to the legal standards and it was adulterated with toxic chemicals which are injurious to health in a long run. People should be educated about the toxic effects of different adulterants on their health...|$|E
