500|$|... the indie {{rock band}} Guillemots have {{recorded}} more than 80 songs for their four studio albums and other official releases. The band {{was formed in}} November 2004, with their first official material being I Saw Such Things in <b>My</b> <b>Sleep,</b> an extended play (EP) released in September 2005. The EP contained four songs, including [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", a track that would also feature on their first studio album, Through the Windowpane. The release of I Saw Such Things in <b>My</b> <b>Sleep</b> was followed three months later by Guillemots' debut single, [...] "Trains to Brazil". Like [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", it was also included on Through the Windowpane, which was released in July 2006. The album's songs were well received by critics: review aggregator Metacritic gave the record a score of 81 out of 100, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Craig McLean of The Observer described them as [...] "gorgeous tunes that are lithe enough {{to cope with the}} little bursts of sonic madness". Two additional tracks were released as singles from the album: [...] "We're Here" [...] and [...] "Annie, Let's Not Wait".|$|E
500|$|The soprano {{sings the}} [...] in long notes. Hofmann {{notes that the}} Dorian mode within the {{instrumental}} concerto in E minor adds a [...] "slightly archaic flavour". The lower voices participate in the instrumental motifs for lines 1, 2, 3 and 5, but lines 4 and 6 are treated differently. In accordance to the text, [...] "sanft und stille" [...] (calm and quiet) and [...] "der Tod ist mein Schlaf worden" [...] (death has become <b>my</b> <b>sleep),</b> they are performed softly (piano), in homophony, chromatic, and modulating to distant keys. Dürr notes the movement's [...] "extremely dense, highly expressive texture" [...] with motifs independent from the hymn tune but derived from its beginning. The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones observes that the movement foreshadows , the opening chorus of Bach's St Matthew Passion, in key, 12/8 metre and [...] "much else".|$|E

The writing was interrupted by his doctor, {{with whom he had}} a short discussion using the same method. When the doctor left, Rosenzweig did not wish to continue with the writing, and he died on the night of December 10, 1929, in Frankfurt, the sentence left unfinished.|$|E
2500|$|Invocation. Hamlet {{addresses}} the Ghost (Hamlet: Spectre infernal! Image venerée! [...] "Infernal apparition! Venerated image!"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders {{them to do}} so. The ghost speaks: Écoute-moi! [...] "Listen to me!". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: [...] "Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> and {{taking advantage of the}} hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven." [...] The ghost withdraws, his parting words: Souviens-toi! [...] "Remember me!" [...] Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: Ombre chére, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton vœu! ... je me souviendrai! [...] "Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!"). The English musicologist Elizabeth Forbes has written: [...] "Even the composer's detractors, and there have been many, are agreed that Thomas' music for this scene is masterly; he catches the chilling, gloomy atmosphere perfectly...." [...] In his review of the recording with Thomas Hampson as Hamlet, Barrymore Laurence Scherer says [...] "Thomas captures Hamlet's shadowy malaise in both vocal line and somber accompaniment.... The intimacy of the recording provides Thomas Hampson with ample opportunity {{to make the most of}} the relationship between words and music..." [...] The orchestral music which accompanies his vow to avenge his father's murder is another example of a theme which reoccurs multiple times at key points in the drama.|$|E

2500|$|Templer {{remained}} with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, {{he was sent}} to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener's Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer's arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his 'C' Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer's battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion in , now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, [...] "I still sometimes in <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. It was a terrible thing to have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties". A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.|$|E

It was in <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> that I was different. From my {{earliest}} recollection <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> was a period of terror. Rarely were my dreams tinctured with happiness. As a rule, they were stuffed with fear--and with a fear so strange and alien that it had no ponderable quality. No fear that I experienced in my waking life resembled the fear that possessed me in <b>my</b> <b>sleep.</b> It was of a quality and kind that transcended all my experiences.|$|E
