5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E

25|$|Athetosis {{can vary}} from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunction</b> can be restricted to a part of body or present throughout the body, depending on {{the individual and the}} severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, hypotonia, spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from cognitive deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{presence}} of cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in acute whiplash-associated disorders, evaluate their course and assess their predictive value for long-term recovery. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were used to select studies of {{the presence of}} cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> within the acute stage (<[*] 6 weeks) after whiplash trauma and/or their predictive value for the development of chronic whiplash-associated disorders. RESULTS: The presence of cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in the acute stage after whiplash trauma was investigated in 4 cohorts. The course of cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in whiplash-associated disorders was examined in 4 cohorts, and the predictive value on outcome 1 year post-whiplash trauma was assessed in 3 cohorts. Reduced cervical mobility, disturbed kinaesthesia, and altered muscle activity were found in the acute stage, and these persisted over time in the moderate/severe group. The predictive value of examining the presence of cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> was doubtful. The course and predictive value of initial reduced cervical mobility was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Cervical <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> are present soon after whiplash trauma persisting in those with moderate/severe symptoms. However, these dysfunctions have limited predictive value, and hence may not explain the complex clinical picture of whiplash-associated disorders. This systematic review highlights the need for differentiating between patients with acute whiplash-associated disorders taking into account the biopsychological framework. status: publishe...|$|R

Although these impairments {{have been reported}} to impact more heavily upon a patient's quality of life than any <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> there are currently no interventions capable of adequately targeting these non-motor deficits. ObjectivesUtilizing a rodent model of PD, we investigated whether cell replacement therapy, using intrastriatal transplants of human-derived ventral mesencephalic (hVM) grafts, could alleviate cognitive and neuropsychiatric, as well as <b>motor,</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> MethodsRats with unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions to the medial forebrain bundle were tested on a complex operant task that dissociates motivational, visuospatial and motor impairments sensitive to the loss of dopamine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Rehabilitation of upper-limb {{sensorimotor}} {{function in}} children with <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> is primarily based on movement training. This study developed a virtual-reality based, paediatric interactive therapy system (PITS) that allows children to practice specific movements of the upper limbs with immediate feedback about their motor performance. METHODS: The system was tested on five children with <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> over 3 weeks of training. Pre- and post-assessment was conducted {{before and after the}} training period. RESULTS: Results of the pilot study show improvements of hand function in the test scores (except one patient). Patient motivation was high and maintained {{over the course of the}} therapy sessions.

25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Co-localization of {{dopamine}} D 1 (D 1 R) and D 3 receptors (D 3 R) {{in specific}} neuronal {{populations in the}} striatum and nucleus accumbens suggests that their cross-talk in the regulation of rewarding mechanisms and emotional and cognitive processes and {{in the development of}} <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> might involve direct interactions. This paper summarizes recent data showing that D 1 R and D 3 R form a receptor heteromer in the striatum. A unique characteristic of this receptor complex is a synergistic interaction by which D 3 R stimulation increases D 1 R agonist affinity, allows a stronger stimulatory coupling of the D 1 R to the cAMP system and potentiates D 1 R-mediated behaviour. The putative role of the D 1 R-D 3 R heteromer in the development of <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> is also discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Cerebral palsy is {{characterized}} by abnormal muscle tone, reflexes, or motor development and coordination. There can be joint and bone deformities and contractures (permanently fixed, tight muscles and joints). The classical symptoms are spasticity, spasms, other involuntary movements (e.g., facial gestures), unsteady gait, problems with balance, or soft tissue findings consisting largely of decreased muscle mass. Scissor walking (where the knees come in and cross) and toe walking (which can contribute to a gait reminiscent of a marionette) are common among people with CP {{who are able to}} walk, but taken on the whole, CP symptomatology is very diverse. The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of <b>motor</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible {{at the other end of}} the spectrum. Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone, some have normal or low muscle tone. [...] High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia.|$|E
