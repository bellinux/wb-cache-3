Due to its pozzolanic nature, <b>micro</b> <b>silica</b> {{can be used to}} enhance the qualities of both fresh and hardened concrete. Addition of <b>micro</b> <b>silica</b> into the concrete as a cement replacement, decreases its permeability. As a result, it forms very dense and chemically durable concrete to withstand the harsh and corrosive chemical environments. The results of detailed investigations on concrete made from type V cement with addition of <b>micro</b> <b>silica</b> as substituent and its curing by tap water shows dramatic increase is compressive strength (CS) of concrete after 7 days of hydration onwards.

40|$|Introduction: Investment {{materials}} {{have been used}} to produce molds for casting of Inlays, Onlays, crowns and bridges. In this study, gypsum and investments routinely used in Iran, were evaluated and characterized, then α hemi hydrate calcium sulfate and a new dental investment with a gypsum-micro silica binder were fabricated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to produce and evaluate a new gypsum investment product in Iran. Using this production, it could be not necessary to import this material from other countries. Methods and Materials: Yellow, well-mixed, orthodontic gypsums and casting investments routinely used in Iran, were evaluated and characterized with scanning electron microscopy elemental analysis (SEM) and XRD phase analysis. The morphology of these materials also was evaluated. Gypsum mineral (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) was fired at 3 atmosphere autoclave and dental stone produced, and evaluated. New dental investment was fabricated with fine silica, Alumina, Silicon Carbide, <b>Micro</b> <b>Silica</b> and Polypropylene. Cold crushing strength (CCS) and setting expansion tests were performed. Casting was done at new molds. Phase changing of investments was tested at high temperatures with x- ray diffraction phase analysis. Compressive strength of some samples was tested after firing. Results: Using above techniques showed that yellow and well-mixed gypsum are dental stones, orthodontic gypsum is high strength stone and investments have phosphate bonds. New investment has efficiency at 1000 °C, and more. There isn't any decomposition in gypsums at these temperatures. Silicon Carbide and polypropylene increase CCS. Compressive Strength of these new investments increases 7 times after firing. Conclusion: <b>Micro</b> <b>silica</b> is used as a refractory and binder. <b>Micro</b> <b>silica</b> is very fine and has a large specific surface. So it is a good binder and it leads a smooth surface castings. Silicon Carbide increases investment strength and thermal resistance. Poly propylene increases spaces for escaping of gases during casting. New gypsum- <b>micro</b> <b>silica</b> investment can be used at temperatures more than 1000 °‍‍‍C.

Two new µWMCs architectures are introduced: 1) a linearly variable column (LVC) and 2) a step-gradient column (SGC). The width of a 1 -m long, 250 -µm-deep LVC is gradually reduced from 120 to 20 µm at 1 µm/cm.

By using a <b>micro</b> fluorescent <b>silica</b> detector to monitor online the dynamic irradiance fluctuation, the accuracy in fluence quantification could be increased by up to 15 %. Solution pH governed the speciation of selected SAs, thus impacting significantly their molar absorption coefficients (epsilon), fluence-based photolysis rate constants (k'), and quantum yields. An increasing pH induced a hyperchromic effect and a blue shift of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of selected SAs, thus causing the anionic species to show a relatively higher specific epsilon value than the neutral species at 254 nm. On UV exposure, the photodegradation of selected SAs all followed pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The SAs with a penta-heterocycle, because of their higher electron densities, exhibited an obviously higher photodegradation rate than those with a hexa-heterocycle. The specific k' values of the neutral and anionic species were in the ranges of (0. 30 - 14. 49) x 10 (- 3) and (0. 61 - 20. 90) x 10 (- 3) cm(2) mJ(- 1), respectively.
