500|$|A typical {{test setup}} with a {{waveguide}} slotted line {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4).

Speed abilities in all their demonstrations are one of the most important fitness skills in today’s soccer. In our research, we assumed that the higher the <b>match</b> <b>load</b> players achieve, the greater the impact of this load on the level of the selected speed abilities would be. We carried out a cross-sectional ex post facto research. The monitored group consisted of the players of the team playing in the first league (Fortuna League).

In this research <b>matching</b> <b>load</b> resistance determined and optimum output was measured by connecting the piezoelectric cantilever arrays to resistance ranging from 10 Ω to 1 MΩ while excited by constant vibration source at frequency of 300 Hz and acceleration of 1 -g level. The result shows that <b>matching</b> <b>load</b> resistance for one single piezoelectric cantilever is 13 KΩ. When two, three and four cantilevers are connected in series, the <b>matching</b> <b>load</b> resistance is 26 kΩ, 39 kΩ and 52 kΩ respectively. While in parallel connection, <b>matching</b> <b>load</b> resistance reduced to 6. 5 kΩ, 4. 5 kΩ and 3. 5 kΩ for two, three, and four connected cantilevers respectively. In series configuration, the voltage output produced is much higher as compared to the piezoelectric cantilever arrays that are connected in parallel connection. The voltage output of the piezoelectric cantilever increased from 3. 41 V to 6. 09 V when it is connected in series configuration with same polarity. Whereas in term of power output, piezoelectric cantilever arrays in parallel configuration produce higher power output as compared to piezoelectric cantilever arrays in series connection.

40|$|Background The {{influence}} of fixture congestion on injury rates and team performance {{has only been}} scarcely investigated. Aim To study associations between recovery time and <b>match</b> <b>load</b> and injury rates and team performance in professional football. Methods Exposure and time loss injuries were registered prospectively from 27 teams over 11 seasons. Matches were grouped according to recovery days before each match (≤ 3 vs > 3  days, and ≤ 4 vs ≥ 6  days). Injury rates and team performance were compared between groups. <b>Match</b> <b>load</b> in <b>match</b> sequences containing five consecutive matches {{was determined by the}} number of days separating the first match and the last training session during that match sequence. Linear regression was used to study associations between <b>match</b> <b>load</b> and injury rates and team performance. Results Team performance showed no association with <b>match</b> <b>load,</b> or recovery days prior to matches, except for Europa League matches that indicated more matches lost with short recovery (≤ 3  days) (p= 0. 048). Total injury rates and muscle injury rates were increased in league matches with ≤ 4  days compared with ≥ 6  days’ recovery (RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 18, and RR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 51, respectively), specifically hamstring and quadriceps injuries. High <b>match</b> <b>load</b> was associated with increase in muscle injury rate in matches in the same match sequence (p= 0. 012), and increase in ligament injury rate in training in the subsequent match sequence (p= 0. 003). Conclusions Fixture congestion was associated with increased muscle injury rates but had no, or very limited, influence on team performance.

50|$|A two-port {{isolator}} {{is obtained}} simply by terminating {{one of the}} three ports with a <b>matched</b> <b>load,</b> which absorbs all the power entering it. The biassed ferrite is part of the circulator and causes a differential phase-shift for signals travelling in different directions.

Because the power is absorbed in an external load, cooling is less of a problem than with a resonance absorption isolator.|$|E

50|$|Such a {{mismatch}} is usually undesired {{and results in}} standing waves along the transmission line which magnifies transmission line losses (significant at higher frequencies and for longer cables). The SWR {{is a measure of}} the depth of those standing waves and is therefore a measure of the matching of the load to the transmission line.

50|$|One way of {{thinking}} about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a parasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. As is well known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects all of the incident power 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a <b>matched</b> <b>load,</b> and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the antenna element. If the transmitted voltage wave were 180 degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). Thus a half-wave parasitic element radiates a wave 180° out of phase with the incident wave.|$|E
