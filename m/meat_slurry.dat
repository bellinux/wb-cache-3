40|$|Nisin at 75 ppm (75 microgram/g) was {{superior}} to 150 ppm of nitrite in inhibiting outgrowth of Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 spores in <b>meat</b> <b>slurries,</b> which had been heated to simulate the process used for cooked ham. The inhibitory activity of nisin decreased as the spore load or pH of the slurries increased. Unlike nitrite, inhibition by nisin was unaffected by high levels of iron either as a constituent of meats or when added as an iron salt. In slurries treated with 75 ppm of nisin, refrigerated storage for 56 days resulted in depletion of nisin to a level low enough to allow outgrowth within 3 to 10 days if the slurries were subsequently abused at 35 degrees C. In contrast, a combination of 40 ppm of nitrite and either 75 or 100 ppm of nisin almost completely inhibited outgrowth in these slurries. The nisin-nitrite combination appeared to have a synergistic effect, and the low concentration of nitrite was sufficient to preserve the color in meats {{similar to that of}} products cured with 150 ppm of nitrite...|$|R
40|$|Forty-four {{microorganisms}} {{were studied}} for {{their influence on}} staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin production. Inhibition {{was found to be}} more common than stimulation. Two types of inhibition were observed: inhibition of staphylococcal growth, and inhibition of enterotoxin formation with no apparent effect on growth. By use of a plate test, 12 of the 44 food microorganisms were found to inhibit staphylococcal growth at 35 C. Of the 12, 3 also inhibited growth at 25 C. No significant differences in inhibition were observed with the 15 strains of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. In <b>meat</b> <b>slurries,</b> inhibition of staphylococcal growth was found to be greater at 25 C than at 35 C. Results on inhibition obtained from the plate test could not be correlated with the effect of the organisms in slurries. Environmental conditions were found to affect markedly the influence of food microorganisms on staphylococci. Of the 44 food microorganisms studied, only Bacillus cereus was observed to stimulate significantly staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin formation. Stimulation was more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus 196 E than with other strains of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. Bacillus megaterium and Brevibacterium linens were inhibited by staphylococci. These organisms were completely inhibited when inoculated in mixed cultures with staphylococci. In pure cultures, good staphylococcal growth was found to be accompanied by enterotoxin production; however, in the presence of food microorganisms, good staphylococcal growth occurred without the formation of detectable levels of enterotoxin A...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{determination}} of glycogen on indicator muscle immediately after slaughter is advantageous as it permits {{the prediction of}} a muscle’s ultimate pH (pHu) and allows the identification of high pHu meat carcasses by extrapolation. This thesis examines the development of two rapid glycogen determination methods. The first aim of this thesis {{was to find a}} new glucometer to replace the Bayer ESPRIT™ (Bayer) glucometer currently used in the Rapid pH (RpH) method. Roche’s Accuchek® Advantage II (Accuchek) and Abbott’s Medisense Optium™ (Medisense) glucometers were compared. Accuchek measurements exhibited a positive linear relationship in glucose standards made with water, RpH buffer and glucose spiked meat/buffer slurries ranging from 0 to 500 mg dL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 999, 0. 998 and 0. 995 respectively). Medisense also exhibited a strong positive relationship for glucose standards made with water and RpH buffer; however, a non-linear trend in spiked <b>meat</b> <b>slurries</b> was observed. The second aim of this thesis was to explore the calibration of the KES K 201 (KES Analysis Inc., NY, USA) near-infrared (NIR) diode array spectrometer to measure glycogen and pH at approximately 45 minutes after slaughter (pH 45), and to predict pHu in pre-rigor M. longissimus dorsi (LD) from beef. This first required finding a reference method to calibrate against the NIR instrument. The RpH, Iodine and Bergmeyer methods were compared. Analysis of glycogen in replicate samples of three beef LD muscles at timepoints post-mortem (1, 4, 9 and 20 hours) was conducted. No significant difference in glycogen concentration was found between an enzymatic and an iodine based colorimetric method at each timepoint; however, the Iodine method was more consistent than the Bergmeyer method at all timepoints. Glucose measurements from the RpH method were consistent; however the pattern of glycogen decline at increasing timepoints post-mortem did not correspond with existing published studies. NIR spectra (538 to 1677 nm) of LD muscles from steers (n = 47), cows (n = 28) and bulls (n = 20) routinely slaughtered in a commercial abattoir were collected on-line approximately 45 minutes after slaughter. Poor results were obtained for Partial Least Squares (PLS) models generated from the mean reflectance spectra of each animal to measure glycogen and pH 45, and predict pHu (r 2 = 0. 23, 0. 37 and 0. 20 respectively). A high mean square error of prediction (MSEP) for glycogen was also obtained (7. 75). Validation of qualitative models generated with Generalised Partial Least Squares regression (GPLS) found that the optimum model was able to correctly categorise only 42 % of high pHu samples with the remaining portion being wrongly classified as normal pHu meat. When the effect of gender was removed, only 21 % of high pHu carcasses were correctly categorised. Exploratory analysis of the absorbance spectra of the LD muscles showed that a group composed predominantly of steers had a significantly lower pH 45 than other existing groups. Further work is recommended for NIR to be successfully utilised on-line to measure glycogen or predict pHu in pre-rigor carcasses...|$|R

All the oil-inwater emulsions showed high thermal and creamy stability. Results of penetration test and dynamic rheological properties showed la existencia de different types of oil-in-water emulsion structures according to stabilizing system of emulsion. Those structures ranged from concentrate solution-like (stabilized only with SC) (gel strength 0. 06 mJ) to gel-like (samples containing MTG) behaviours (gel strength ranged between 3. 4 and 6. 2 mJ). Morphological differences in the organization of the network structure were observed (by scanning electron microscopy) as functions of the protein system used to stabilize the oil-in-water emulsions. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Bread {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} foods worldwide. It is high in carbohydrate and low in protein content. Nowadays, an increasing number of people prefer healthier food with balanced nutrients. Red meat is known to possess high quantity of complete protein and also rich in micronutrients. Navy bean is rich in fibre and plant protein as well, and it is also a low glycaemic index food. In the present study, I seek to develop a new bread product with rich protein content from red meat and fibre-rich navy bean to improve the nutritional values. The objectives of this research were to investigate physicochemical, sensory attributes and digestibility of wheat bread substituted with red meat and navy bean at different levels. The hypothesis of this study was that the fortification of bread with red meat and navy bean will improve the nutritional values of bread with improved physicochemical, sensory and digestibility. In my study, bread formulations with 25 % and 50 % of raw beef by weight (containing 66 g and 132 g <b>meat</b> <b>slurry,</b> respectively), navy bean powder (15 % and 30 %), and mixed <b>meat</b> <b>slurry</b> and navy bean powder (10 M 30 NB, 18 M 15 NB, 20 M 30 NB and 35 M 15 NB) were developed. All samples were then evaluated for their physical, nutritional and sensory attributes. In addition, static in vitro digestion model was used to analyse the effects of the new ingredients on the digestibility of the enriched bread. In vivo the glycaemic index of bread samples was measured in healthy subjects. All of the fortified bread samples, except 15 NB and 30 NB, showed significant increase (p < 0. 05) in protein content, whereas carbohydrate content was found to decrease significantly (p < 0. 05) in all bread samples. Substitution of wheat flour with meat and navy bean resulted in significantly lower (p < 0. 05) loaf volume with an increased loaf weight as compared to the control. Fortified breads were noted to significantly decrease (p < 0. 05) in the lightness and increase redness (red meat) and yellowness according to the L*, a*, b* colour system. Texture results showed that the 25 M, 50 M and 35 M 15 NB breads were significantly increased (p < 0. 05) in hardness as compared to the control. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of control bread had more randomly distributed gluten matrix as compared to the fortified breads, which had less starch granules embedded into larger protein matrix. Sensory evaluation showed that 15 NB bread had the highest score for overall liking attribute. Addition of meat and navy bean contributed to increment the deficient essential amino acids in bread, such as lysine, threonine and leucine. Fortified breads showed relatively lower glycaemic index (GI) value in bread than the control. Overall, the results showed that the incorporation of meat and navy bean changed the nutritional and physicochemical properties and digestibility of bread and GI values as well. The outcome of the present study will have greater impact on extending the use of meat to develop healthier food products and aligns with the AgResearch programme “Red Meat Combifoods: End-to-end management of protein nutrition” supported by the Crown Research Institute Core Fund of AgResearch Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Nisin is a {{bacteriocin}} {{produced by}} Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, with antimicrobial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including bacterial spores. Nisin {{has been successfully}} used in numerous products, such as processed cheeses, dairy products and canned foods. However, its effectiveness in meat products is variable due to interactions with certain meat components. The aim of this project therefore was to determine {{a number of factors}} reported to reduce nisin activity in meat and meat products, evaluate the extent of interference with its efficacy and introduce multicomponent preserving systems that improve its antimicrobial action. Loss of nisin activity in meat has been partly ascribed before to the formation of a nisin- glutathione adduct. Activity is lost more quickly in raw meat than in cooked meat and this has been taken as evidence that the reaction is enzyme-mediated. Horizontal agar diffusion method and MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the formation of the nisin-glutathione adduct which was shown not to be enzyme mediated. Retention of activity in cooked meat was shown to be due to loss of free sulfhydryl groups during heat processing {{as a result of the}} reaction of glutathione with proteins and not a result of the inactivation of endogenous enzymes, as indicated by measuring the free thiol content. Microbial enzymes did not appear to play a role as similar losses were seen in raw and cooked meat extracts containing undetectable levels of microorganisms. Enumeration of viable counts indicated that increased nisin concentrations were required for the total inhibition of L. monocytogenes following incubation of nisin with glutathione. The inhibitory effect of glutathione on nisin activity was removed in the presence of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid, sometimes with enhancement of nisin's bactericidal effect. However, there was no evidence for a direct reaction between glutathione and dehydroascorbic acid. The addition of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid in raw meat extract as well as in raw and thermally processed <b>meat</b> <b>slurry</b> was shown to exert the same protective effect seen with laboratory media. The synergy between nisin, ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid was more pronounced at chill temperatures. Simultaneous application of antioxidants and nisin delayed the recovery of nisin-injured L. monocytogenes cells especially at low temperatures. Antioxidants, at the levels used, had no bactericidal effect on their own, but they did retard growth by decreasing growth rate and increasing lag phase. This was probably due to antioxidants diverting energy from injuiy repair-related functions. The effectiveness of the combination of nisin with propyl gallate was completely negated in whole fat UHT milk due to interactions of nisin with fat. Overall, the findings of this study clearly show that nisin performs better when its use is supplemented with other preservation agents or methods, since its amphiphilic properties make it vulnerable to interactions with other food macromolecules resulting in reduced efficacy...|$|E

Meat Science, 93 (2), 310 - 315. doi: 10. 1016 /j. meatsci. 2012. 09. 011 Psychrotolerant clostridia are responsible for spoilage of fresh chilled vacuum-packed red meat (beef, lamb and venison). Red meat is one of New Zealand’s primary exports, and spoilage results in financial loss. Spoilage by psychrotolerant clostridia is difficult to control due to the ability of these bacteria to grow at cold temperatures, down to - 1. 5 °C. They can also form spores that have increased resistance to heat, chemicals, oxygen and desiccation compared to vegetative bacterial cells. As clostridia are strict anaerobes, it is considered highly likely that initial contamination of meat is primarily with spores. The main objective of this work was to determine the triggers of germination of spores, of those psychrophilic and psychrotrophic clostridia, associated with spoilage of New Zealand red meat. Germination of psychrotolerant clostridia was studied using a range of techniques including molecular, in vitro, and on meat methods. In this study in vitro germinant systems were identified for Clostridium frigidicarnis, and a New Zealand species designated LA 1, consisting of lactate in combination with an amino acid. Some of the amino acids identified, including valine and cysteine, are naturally present on the surface of red meat. Failure to chill to, or maintain meat at, the recommended temperature, of - 1. 5 °C and a pH of above 5. 5 were identified as being important factors leading to spoilage by Cl. frigidicarnis. Germination in Clostridium estertheticum was extremely poor in media, compared with <b>meat</b> <b>slurry</b> or fresh meat, preventing the identification of a specific germinant system(s), and indicating a non-nutrient factor may be involved. Two distinct nonchemical interventions, hot water wash (HWW) and cold water wash (CWW), were found to reduce spoilage of vacuum-packed chilled lamb inoculated with spores of Cl. estertheticum. Vegetative cells of psychrotolerant clostridia survived exposure to air longer than expected, upwards of seven days in the case of Cl. estertheticum subsp. estertheticum, suggesting that they play a greater role in initial contamination of meat than originally thought. From an industry point of view the results highlight the importance of preventing initial contamination and proper chilling, as well as the need for further investigation of HWW and CWW interventions...|$|E
