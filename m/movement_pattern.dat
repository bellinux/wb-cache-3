5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

In {{order not to}} overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer is used in order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. Getting {{out of bed}} is {{difficult}} for 27. 6 % of people over 65. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> used by older adults for rising from bed. Subjects. 42 healthy subjects between the ages of 65 and 90. Methods. Subjects were videotaped performing 5 trials of getting out of bed. <b>Movement</b> <b>patterns</b> were categorized for each body part. Results. A number of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> occurred that were not reported in younger people. The most frequent <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> used were: “roll off” (38. 3 %) for the trunk, “double push” (34. 7 %) for the far arm, “multi-push” (36. 0 %) for the near arm, and “synchronous” (31. 2 %) for the legs. Discussion and Conclusion. A variety of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> are used by older people for rising from bed. <b>Movement</b> <b>patterns</b> described in this study can be used as a guide for physical therapists and occupational therapists in teaching age-appropriate strategies for getting out of bed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Collective {{phenomena}} and their associated <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> are ubiquitous in everyday life. However, {{even though we}} need to be able to reason about these phenomena, especially their <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> research suggests that we do not currently possess the tools for doing so. Research has been carried out into the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> of particular types of collective but there appears to be no research into the range of different <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> exhibited by collective phenomena as a class. In order to provide such a tool it is crucial that we understand the relation between the different types of collectives and the various <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> that they may exhibit. By means of examples, this paper compares a classification of collectives and a classification of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> A number of possible links are suggested and the need for a more comprehensive classification of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> sensitive to the different kinds of collective is highlighted. Such a system could be integrated with the current classification of collective phenomena to form a more comprehensive system that once formalised, may allow the representation of a wide range of collective phenomena within an ontology...|$|R

In typical cases medical imaging is not needed.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{tetrapods}} with limbs, plesiosaurs {{must have}} had a certain gait, a coordinated <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> of the, in this case, flippers. Of the infinite number of possibilities, in practice attention has been largely directed {{to the question of whether}} the front pair and hind pair moved simultaneously, so that all four flippers were engaged at the same moment, or in an alternate pattern, each pair being employed in turn. Frey & Riess in 1991 proposed an alternate model, which would have had the advantage of a more continuous propulsion. In 2000, Theagarten Lingham-Soliar evaded the question by concluding that, like sea turtles, plesiosaurs only used the front pair for a powered stroke. The hind pair would have been merely used for steering. Lingham-Soliar deduced this from the form of the hip joint, which would have allowed for only a limited vertical movement. Furthermore, a separation of the propulsion and steering function would have facilitated the general coordination of the body and prevented a too extreme pitch. He rejected Robinson's hypothesis that elastic energy was stored in the ribcage, considering the ribs too stiff for this.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{determine}} the contributing factors of the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> toward the total distance covered by the football referees during the Malaysia Soccer Cup 2012. Seven (7) of referees who officiated the 2012 Malaysian Cup matches were been chosen into this study. All seven matches from the tournament were recorded using Astro beyond decoder and were coding with SportCode Elite Software on the selected performance indicators (P. I) as main <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> variables. This <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> were categorized as forward walking, forward jogging, forward running, standing, backward walking, backward running and sidestep running. The results analyze the frequency and the total time from the executed <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> for correlation and regression analysis by using the Pearson correlation and linear regression test respectively. The Pearson correlation test have shown that there is significant correlation between three <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> and the total distance covered by the referees which are sidestep(r= 0. 97, p= 0. 000, p< 0. 01), forward walking (r= 0. 930, p= 0. 002, p< 0. 01), and forward running (r= 0. 807, p= 0. 028, p< 0. 05). The linear regression test have shown a positive correlation between contributing factors of the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> towards the total distance covered by the football referees where the total distance covered result is 132. 161 + 2. 012 (sidestep) – 4. 575 (forward walking) + 0. 570 (forward jogging) – 2. 940 (forward running) + 1. 404 (backward walking) + 3. 328 (backward running). Hence, this study found that <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> that performed by referees are contributed towards the total distance covered by football referees during a match. Thus, this study can give added values to Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), to consider the three significant <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in designing physical fitness criteria for the referees) ...|$|R

2500|$|Deceptive {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed in Old World monkeys including baboons (Papio ursinus). In one of their articles, Byrne and Whiten recorded observations of [...] "intimate tactical deception" [...] within a group of baboons, and documented examples that they classified as follows: A juvenile using warning screams {{to gain access to}} underground food storages which otherwise would have been inaccessible; an exaggerated [...] "looking" [...] gesture (which in an honest context would mean detection of a predator) produced by a juvenile to avoid attack by an adult male; recruitment of a [...] "fall-guy" [...] (a third party used by the deceiver to draw attention or aggression); and using one's own <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> to draw group-mates away from food caches. Byrne and Whiten also broke these categories into subcategories denoting the modality of the action (e.g. vocalization) and what the action would have signified if observed in an honest context. They noted whether the individual that had been manipulated was in turn used to manipulate others, what the costs had been to the manipulated individual, and whether or not there were additional costs to third parties. Byrne and Whiten expressed concern that these observations might be exceptions, and that such deceptive behaviors might not be common to the species.|$|E

Chaotic temporal dynamics are known to occur in pacemaker neurons in molluscs, but there have been no studies reporting on whether chaotic properties are manifest in the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> of molluscs. Our results suggest that complex search patterns, like the Levy walks made by mud snails, can have their mechanistic origins in chaotic neuronal processes.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Post-stroke motor {{recovery}} {{consists of}} both true recovery and compensatory movements. Although compensatory movements are learned more quickly early after stroke, {{the role of}} compensatory move-ment patterns in functional recovery is controversial. We investigated the role of compensatory <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in the long-term functional motor recovery after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic infarction to induce motor and sensorimotor cortex lesions. The rats were given task-specific training. Behavior tests and analyses of compensatory <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> (head lift, limb withdrawal impairment, phantom grasps, and pellet chasing) during the single-pellet reaching test were performed 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days post stroke. [Results] Successful retrieval during the single-pellet reaching test was significantly correlated with compensatory <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in stroke groups. Motor cortex stroke showed significant correlation in limb withdrawal impairment and pellet chasing. But, sensorimotor cortex stroke was significant correlation in pellet chasing. [Conclusion] The data suggest that compensatory movements after stroke are correlated with spontaneous recovery. Since some compensatory <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> are detrimental to functional recovery, the correct timing of training and control of compensatory <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> might be important...|$|R

Relating perceptual and cognitive aspects of space and formal theories of spatial information has shown promise to foster understanding of the semantics of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> Specifically, we discuss our approach in relation to existing qualitative formalisms such as the region connection calculus (RCC) and the Egenhofer’s intersection formalisms.

We summarize this paper using a movement taxonomy that also provides guidance for future research...|$|R
