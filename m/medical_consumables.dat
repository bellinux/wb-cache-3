40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{costs of}} a hospital-wide {{selective}} screening programme were analysed {{for a period of}} 19 months. During this time, 539 inpatients were screened, of whom 111 were MRSA-positive. Based on microbiological costs (staff and materials) and the costs of preventive contact isolation for 2 days until microbiological results were available (including material costs for <b>medical</b> <b>consumable</b> goods and the {{costs of a}}dditional nursing time), a total of € 26 241. 51 was spent for the 539 patients screened. Based on cost units, the costs were € 39. 96 for a patient found to be MRSA-negative and € 82. 33 for a patient found to be MRSA-positive. Under the prospective diagnosis related groups (DRG) payment system in Germany, the costs of a prolonged hospital stay resulting from a hospital-acquired MRSA infection (HA-MRSA-I) are not reimbursed adequately by revenues, with a calculated average cost-revenue loss/patient with HA-MRSA-I of € 5705. 75. The screening programme was able to prevent 48 % of predicted HA-MRSA-Is (35. 2 patients with infection), thereby saving a predicted € 200 782. 73. After subtracting the screening costs, there was a net saving of € 110 236. 56 annually. A sensitivity analysis of the break-even points for different screening frequencies and different MRSA incidence rates indicated that the screening programme became cost-effective at a low MRSA incidence rate, meaning that it can be recommended for most hospitals with an MRSA problem...|$|R

Objective. NSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Aging and Disability Resource Center of Broward County partnered on a Senior Intervention and Education Program to provide psychosocial {{and health services}} to low income seniors. Methods. Program goals were to (1) teach management techniques and support options to seniors and caregivers to foster self-care and cope with physical limitations, (2) maintain seniors’ independence to remain at home with security, (3) reduce premature institutionalization, and (4) prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. NSU medical students accompanied a nurse/social worker on monthly home visits assessing seniors’ living environments and resources, and evaluating their functional abilities. Results. This program provided services to 248 seniors (64 % aged 75 and older, 62 % female, 72 % White, 28 % Black and 11 % Hispanic). Program services included the free distribution of donated specialized <b>medical</b> equipment, <b>consumable</b> <b>medical</b> supplies (together valued at over $ 33, 000), food and food vouchers (valued at $ 1, 270), case management (1, 112 hours), caregiver training (113 hours), health education (183 episodes), counseling (277 hours), home injury control (192 episodes), assistance with service applications (45 episodes), referral (142 episodes) and inhome emergency respite (280 hours).

40|$|The {{medical care}} of space crews {{is the primary}} {{limiting}} factor in the achievement of long-duration space missions. (Nicogossian 2003) The goal of this thesis {{was to develop a}} model of long-duration human space flight astronaut health and a medical supply demand model in support of such missions. This model will be integrated into an existing comprehensive interplanetary supply chain management and logistics architecture simulation and optimization tool, SpaceNet. The model provides two outputs, Alphah and Mass, for each set of input variables. Alphah is an estimate of crew health and is displayed as a percentage. Mass is a measure of <b>medical</b> <b>consumables</b> expended during the mission and is displayed in kilograms. We have demonstrated that Alphah is a function of three scaling parameters, the type of mission, duration of mission, and gender of crew. The type of mission and gender are linked to radiation fatality data published by NASA and mission duration correlates to predicted incidence of illness and injury and linked to the model through published US Navy submarine crew medical data. The mass of <b>medical</b> <b>consumables</b> (MMC) expended increases with the number of crew, the duration of the mission and the distance of the mission away from the earth. The degree of medical expertise on-board is not necessarily related to a change in consumption of medical supplies but perhaps to a better outcome for the individual infirmed crew member. (cont.) We have determined that there is no information to incorporate gender into this aspect of the model and that the ages of the crewmembers would also have a negligible effect. Risk was investigated as an additional independent driver in the calculations. This parameter defined as likelihood of a medical event multiplied by impact to the mission, is in line with current NASA planning processes. Although the equations don't currently incorporate this parameter, implementation in subsequent versions of the model would allow for a more granular description of medical supply mass (i. e. laboratory and diagnostic, imaging, medications, surgical supplies, telemedicine and expert systems equipment) needed to support long-duration human operations in space. The framework of SpaceNet does not currently allow for this level of detail but future version of the software would likely develop and integrate this capability. by Albert Assad. Thesis (S. M.)

The significant growth in the healthcare industry implies a more detailed collection and examination of the environmental information so that decisions regarding those specific impacts may ensue. This research focuses on imaging in healthcare. Since the number of CT scans has significantly increased in the U. S. in recent decade, there are efforts to investigate alternative imaging tools. An available option is the latest technologies in digital radiography (DR) : dual-energy imaging, digital tomosynthesis, and computer-aided detection. In this paper, the energy consumed by the DR technologies is compared to the energy consumed by CT. The overall goal is to determine areas for energy savings.

This study describes the effect of a hospital-wide screening of defined risk groups in a 700 -bed acute care hospital during a period of 19 months. In a cohort study with a 19 -month control period, the frequencies of hospital-acquired MRSA infections were compared with and without screening. In the control period, there were 119 MRSA-positive patients, of whom 48 had a hospital-acquired MRSA infection. On the basis of this frequency, a predicted total of 73. 2 hospital-acquired MRSA infections was calculated for the screening period, but only 52 % of the expected number (38 hospital-acquired MRSA infections) were observed, i. e, 48 % of the predicted number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections were prevented by the screening programme.

MethodsA 22 -item checklist was developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) guidelines and existing central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) checklists. The checklist was used to observe 375 central line procedures performed in the intensive care units of four tertiary hospitals of Mongolia between July and December 2010. In parallel, 36 face-to-face interviews were conducted in six other tertiary hospitals to explain practice variations and identify barriers. ResultsThe baseline compliance level across all components of the checklist was 68. 5 %. The main factors explaining low levels of compliance were outdated local standards, a lack of updated guidelines, poor control over compliance with existing clinical guidelines, poor supply of <b>medical</b> <b>consumables,</b> and insufficient knowledge of contemporary infection control measures among health care providers. ConclusionsThe health authorities of Mongolia need to adequately address the prevention and control of CLABSIs in their hospitals.

Methods: An observational study with cross sectional design. This study was conducted from March to December 2012 in Sampang District east Java Province Indonesia. Midwives attitudes were gathered through questionnaires for delivered during regular meeting at District Health Office of Sampang. Focus Group Discussion for midwives conducted at Batulenger and Robatal Health Centers. All data were analyzed descriptively, through content analysis. Results: This study indicated that most of midwives supported the implementation of Jampersal. They believed that Jampersal will assist midwives activities in attempting decrease maternal and neonatal mortality. According to midwives, barriers to delivery access by health professionare financial and transportation as well as culture and geographic barriers. Midwives stated tasks and rewards that they have accepted is in appropiate. However, midwives agreed to continue Jampersal that program widely. Midwives prefer to assist medical service rather than delivery services. Never the less, most of midwives prefer to serve birth delivering ratherthan refer delivery to the hospital.

Aim: To show clinical features of chronic critical illness and possible solutions for long term care. Materials and methods: Electronic searches of literature using words related to critical illness, chronic disease, physiotherapy. Results: Most of critically ill patients need prolonged mechanical ventilation and/or tracheostomy. Agressive intensive care treatment, advanced age and comorbidities are major {{risk factors for}} development of chronic critical illness. Chronic critical illness except prolonged mechanical ventilation and/or tracheostomy includes severe complications in almost all organs and organ systems (severe neuromyopathy, metabolic disorders, generalized oedema, pressure sores, reccurent infections, hormonal changes, emotional changes, etc.). Prolonged specialized care is associated with high costs for <b>medical</b> equipment and <b>consumable</b> <b>medical</b> supplies.
