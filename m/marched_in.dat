5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 <b>marched</b> <b>in</b> Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, the 26th Battalion undertook a series of training camps around northern Queensland as it began to re-establish its numbers. Between September and November, it was based around Kissing Point, Queensland, before moving to Townsville in February 1940, and then south of Bowen the following month. At this time, it was placed {{under the command of}} the 11th Brigade, along with the 31st and 51st Battalions, both of which were Queensland-based Militia battalions. In mid-1940, the battalion's strength fluctuated as compulsory service was reintroduced and drafts of national servicemen <b>marched</b> <b>in</b> for short periods of training, while volunteers were released to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) and other services. Many of the initial recruits came from Italian-Australian families from north Queensland, but as the battalion grew, reinforcements from other Australian states arrived during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The {{cause of}} death was a liver abscess, {{although}} whether it was amoebic or bacterial is not clear.

Protesters — led by People's Party members, Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum (Foro Español de la Familia) — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they {{considered}} {{an attack on the}} traditional family and Spanish values; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event. Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with Gay Pride Day, FELGT (Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people <b>marched</b> <b>in</b> favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.|$|E
5|$|The Arab army <b>marched</b> <b>in</b> three {{separate}} corps, with Ashinas {{once again in}} front, the caliph in the middle, and Afshin bringing up the rear. Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Theophilos, anxious to prevent the city's fall, left Constantinople for Dorylaion, and from there sent an embassy to Mu'tasim. His envoys, who arrived shortly before or during {{the first days of}} the siege, offered assurances that the atrocities at Sozopetra had been against the emperor's orders, and further promised to help rebuild the city, to return all Muslim prisoners, and to pay a tribute. The caliph, however, not only refused to parley with the envoys, but detained them in his camp, so that they could observe the siege.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then <b>marched</b> <b>in</b> Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E
