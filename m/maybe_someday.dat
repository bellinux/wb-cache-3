2500|$|The project coordinators (including book {{publisher}} and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Earhart {{and asked her}} to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. There is a commemorative blue plaque at the site. Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, [...] "Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes." [...] She added, [...] "... <b>maybe</b> <b>someday</b> I'll try it alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>someday</b> they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to talk about something else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E

5000|$|The band's growing {{popularity}} did not going unnoticed by major label MCA Records, who inked the Clarks to a two-album deal in 1996. Working with Los Angeles producer Tim Bomba, the group recorded at the Club House studio in Germantown, New York—their first album {{to be produced}} away from Pittsburgh. MCA released <b>Someday</b> <b>Maybe</b> {{in the fall of}} 1996 with the intent of promoting [...] "Stop!" [...] and [...] "Courtney" [...] as the main singles. Unfortunately for the band, MCA instead decided to focus its energy in promoting Blink-182, neglecting to afford any substantial attention to the Clarks. To make matters worse, the label suffered financially in 1997 and as a result, MCA dropped many newly-signed artists, including the Clarks. The group, however, was not discouraged, as the album had again sold well in the Pittsburgh area and [...] "Mercury" [...] and [...] "Caroline" [...] were being played on the region's stations. Following the band's release from MCA, they re-released <b>Someday</b> <b>Maybe</b> (with different cover art) and I'll Tell You What Man… as King Mouse releases.|$|R

I'll Tell You what Man... was followed by The Clarks in 1991, which introduced [...] "Penny on the Floor."

50|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{experience with}} MCA, the Clarks moved forward. The band released their first live album, recorded at Nick's Fat City night club on Pittsburgh's South Side and aptly-titled Live, in 1998. Scott Blasey, in turn, released his second solo album, Shine, in 1999. The group continued {{to perform at}} packed shows throughout the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, but did not immediately record a follow-up to <b>Someday</b> <b>Maybe.</b> However, they would experience a new chance at broader success {{with the arrival of}} the New Millennium.

5000|$|Sedon {{also did}} some major {{woodwork}} on the Pleasant Grove (Salem, Virginia).

5000|$|In 1995, Blasey's {{first solo}} album, Don't Try This at Home, was released. It was {{recorded}} at Studio L in Weirton, West Virginia, {{and was a}} moderate success. In a very favorable review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that his [...] "grasp of the nuances of rock 'n' roll's moral landscape has put him at the front ranks of the regional music scene for years." [...] It went on to say, [...] "What Don't Try This at Home reveals exactly is {{the full range of}} Blasey's emotional timbre unencumbered by the bombast of Top 40 considerations."

50|$|<b>Someday</b> <b>Maybe</b> is the 1996 fourth album by Pittsburgh band The Clarks. The record {{constituted}} {{both the}} band's {{first and last}} major label release. After two successful local records on a self-created label, MCA inked {{a deal with the}} band, giving them at least a shot at national success. However, MCA was in financial disarray at the time, due to it being bought out by a larger corporation. In turn, many struggling or newly signed bands were cut from the label. Before 'Someday Maybe' received any promotion, The Clarks were one of many bands that saw their contracts with MCA be terminated in 1997. Despite this heartbreak, the album did perform well in Pittsburgh. 'Stop!', a song that could draw comparison's 'For What It's Worth' by Buffalo Springfield, was intended to be the band's first nation single. Instead, it was relegated to only local success. The traditional rock love song 'Caroline' and the Southern rock influenced 'Mercury' were also major hits in the Pittsburgh market. The Clarks' problems with MCA nearly ruined their careers, and it certainly left them disillusioned with the recording industry. It would take 4 years for the band to release their next album.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, saying [...] "He's too quick to reach for sexist clichés; cheap shots at groupies and gold diggers {{undercut}} moments of real emotion. What Wale lusts for most of all is respect. [...] "Fuck fame, fuck money," [...] he declares. [...] "I'm {{just trying to be}} legendary." [...] <b>Someday,</b> <b>maybe,</b> but not quite yet." [...] The A.V. Club gave the album a B, saying [...] "In its efforts to woo women listeners, Ambition softens some of the harder edges from Maybach’s other releases, but Ross’ rotund shadow looms large over the record nonetheless. The mogul gets feature credits on two songs, and even on a couple of tracks he isn’t billed on. He’s there in the background, grunting approvingly, reminding everybody who made this possible." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a five out of ten, saying [...] "There’s also no risks taken here compared to his debut. Instead, Ambition gives us pretty much the same song over and over again with just a few variations on the template, and feels like the hip-hop equivalent of listening to some pop rock band’s album who you’d never have guessed was being bet on by a major unless you were told. The music’s efficient and there’s literally nothing to get annoyed or disgusted by (unless [...] "Illest Bitch" [...] weirds you out for his calling his sister in a bitch in a positive context) and so Ambition leaves listeners to answer the simple question of whether they want an exceptionally unchallenging album to listen to for an hour or not. I’ll just take the highlights." ...|$|R
5000|$|New York {{attorney}} Floyd Abrams {{had urged}} CNN/Time Warner to retract the report, while acknowledging {{that it may}} have had truth to it, saying, [...] "It doesn't necessarily mean that the story isn't true. … Who knows?

40|$|Translation begins] Friday My Darling, I’m happy today- got {{a letter}} from you. The mailman just came. Gee, honey, I love you so. What a day. It’s all cloudy and looks as though it were going to rain any second. Hope it doesn’t. Have to go shopping- {{strictly}} window shopping- in New Rochelle and Mt. Vernon. Having more trouble trying to find a negligee that isn’t marquisette (any way the kind that you can’t see through. They’re all like celephane [sic].) Maybe today I’ll find one. Shooting skeet must be hard. That sounds good- 19 out of 25. I’d be amazed to come close to one out of 25. That’s something else you’ll have to teach me- how to shoot. Then when I catch you running ‘round with other women I can be real dramatic about it. Goley [sic], honey, I wish you’d finish that night flying. It must be awful to fly so late + then get up at the same ungodly hour in the morning. Anytime you’re too tired or don’t feel like writing don’t. Not that you would but don’t feel that you have to. I realize how hard it is for you to write so often. I hope it doesn’t rain on March 11 th. Oh, that reminds me. I had the craziest dream last night. We got married + then you disappeared suddenly right after the ceremony and the next thing I remember you were flying around. It was so vivid. You were buzzing all the houses and I was trying to get your attention. I can remember I had my wedding dress on + it looked very nice but you wouldn’t come down. Then this fellow from the Navy Air Corps came + we were talking (this must have been a hangover from “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”.) He looked like Bob- the one Van Johnson was going to buy a ranch with. He was complaining about how fresh the Marines were. I was telling him what had happened + he wanted to know what else I could expect from a Marine. After about five minutes I’d convinced him that you weren’t a marine + were the the [sic] best pilot in the Army Air Corps. Then you finally drove up in a car- Gee, it was a funny dream. It was much more complicated than that but it wouldn’t make sense to you. You looked so cute, though. Woody and I are going to see “National Velvet” tonight. It’s supposed to be good. As long as it’s about a horse I’m sure to like it. That reminds me, honey, we should go riding sometime. Maybe when we’re old and gray someday we’ll go. Oh, honey, don’t you want to send any announcements to Steve or any of the fellows in the Air Corps. We’ll have loads of them so don’t worry about that. Golly, you only get married once on March 11 th. We’re having a couple hundred made so we have to use them up. What a wedding this is going to be! Nothing has gone the way we planned! You’ve changed your bestman + I’ve changed my attendants and the place has been changed. That’s what I like- everything goes exactly the opposite from the way we plan. Wonder if that will happen all our lives. Hope so- I love things to happen. Are you {{going to be able to}} get the rings this weekend, honey? Or aren’t they giving you open Post? This week went real fast for me- The weekends always do anyway. Oh honey, are you going to have our rings engraved there? Let me know about your ring so I can send you the money, hon. You most certainly didn’t answer my questions about Scotch! (Not until this letter). You didn’t tell me how much to get. I’ll get more than one bottle, honey. One bottle will never last you until we get out of the south. Someone is playing “I’m Beginning To See The Light”. Hope I can remember to buy some ink, honey, this stuff is getting lighter and lighter. Gee, honey, only 16 more days. You’ll probably be getting your rings about now. Hope it’s a nice day but I probably wouldn’t know the difference. Gee, honey, it won’t be much longer now. You’re just too wonderful, honey! You’re just too, too wonderful. I wish I could be with you now. I miss you more + more every day. The sun just came out. Happy Day! It still looks like a storm. I love you so- Well, honey, just got back from “National Velvet”. It was wonderful. What a picture. I love horses- Woody + I went and I’ve almost got her talked into going riding. Gee, I love you honey. <b>Someday</b> <b>maybe</b> we’ll go riding together. Tomorrow I may go if it’s nice out and not too cold- Woody’s never been and I’m trying to get her to go. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I wish we were going to be married now instead of in sixteen more days. Well, honey it’s pretty late. Guess I better get to bed. I’ll write tomorrow, my darling, I miss you more and more. And they’ll never be words enough to tell you how very much I love you. Do you know Carol’s sister? She had a baby boy the other day. Her husband was killed in France the first day he went into action- the only thing that kept her going was the baby. She was praying so that it would be a boy. Carol is real busy now being an Aunt. Well, honey, as I said before I’d better be getting. I love you and will love you Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R

This letter {{certainly}} isn’t progressing very rapidly. Interruptions- always interruptions. Let’s see, where was I. Oh, yes, happy- oh I said that already as you can tell I’m a little confused. Have you told Sweetie what time we’re getting married? What a nice sound that has. Will he be able to get there in time? How far away are you from him? It’s freezing in here- I’m curled up under a blanket. Wish you were here honey. Boy will I be glad to get down there where it’s nice and warm. Probably the temperature will hit an all time low march 9 th. Golly, darling, why does time go so darned slowly when we’re apart and so fast the minute we’re together. Trying to locate my calendar now to count the days until March 11 th. About five times a day I count and always get the same answer. Found it. Only 25 more days, darling. Will you be able to see us at all. I hope that we can be together for a while before we’re married. Everyone keeps telling me that’s the happiest time- fine thing, that’s very encouraging. But it certainly has been wonderful even though we weren’t together very much. In 12 more days I won’t be working. That will be so nice. Lying in bed all morning, what a lovely dream. Golly, I won’t be able to lie in bed in the morning until after we’re married- I’ll have to much to do. Remember that street car conductor that I told you about. He married 12 women + said he must have been crazy. He looked like such a wonderful nice old man. That just goes to prove- you never can tell about men! Oh, honey, I finally found a Valentine that was half way what I wanted. You probably won’t get it until after Valentine’s day. Anyway, the thought was there. What a day. We got out early today again. Thank goodness. I’m sorry that I didn’t write last night or at least I don’t think I did. At this point I’m not sure about anything. Honestly, what a fog I’m in. Anyhow to get back to last night. Went to see “The Very Thought of You”. Gee, it was cute- Have you seen it? It reminded me so much of you + I + Woody + Steve. Almost any picture lately reminds me of you though. You wrote in your letter last Friday that you missed me that night more than usual. It’s the strangest thing but I missed you more that night and loved you more than usual. Isn’t that strange. That Jack Carson show is on again. He’s in a plane sitting in a bomb bay, or on it or whatever you do in a bomb bay door. Anyway, Jack wanted {{to know what to do}} if the bomb bay doors opened. Teacher said pick out a nice German factory and don’t forget to go “bang” when you hit it. Gee, darling, I love you so much. I wish we were together tonight and every night. Gee, honey, I hope you get that night flying over with soon. You’ll be so tired if you don’t try to get as much rest as you can before we come down. When do you start on your night cross countries? How many do you have? On those x countries, honey, do you fly more than four hours? I love the way you tell me that you’re going to try to call me and then you never call when you plan to + besides I always get the letters days after you’ve called. I’m so glad that you’re going to get the rings, honey. I wasn’t looking forward to picking them out at all. Oh, don’t forget I wear 3 ½. I had the engagement ring 3 34 / 4 but it’s too big and slides all around – 3 ½ was what he wanted me to have but I never take advice. Have to find out for myself. We don’t have wedding invitations, honey, but we will have announcements. So if you’ll be a good little angel and sit down and make out a list of all your friends that you’d like to tell you’re married, it will help no end. That’s a pretty big order, I know but about how many people would you like to send them to? Give me a rough idea. Not too rough but a good guess. Overestimate rather than underestimate- they’ll probably be millions because I can think of millions off hand. Gee, darling, I wish you were still at Stewart Field- that stationary brings back memories- wasn’t it wonderful when you were getting home every weekend? We were so lucky, hon, to have so much time together. You cost me no end of money lately with all this writing- Because at this point I’m all out of envelopes again. Don’t have any idea of how I’ll mail tis. Yes, honey, that’s the way I figured it out. Texas just should have horses- It sounds very logical. Remember the Rodeo? I hope that we can find some horses because I love riding so. We still haven’t gone together. Every weekend it gets colder + colder or snows or something and I don’t go maybe next weekend. Gee, darling, I wish I could get a sunburn before the wedding. It would look so nice with a white dress. How many hours do you have now, honey? Charlotte’s definitely coming down as you probably know by now. I’m so glad because I wanted someone I knew to be there. What did you do about the rooms honey? Did you change the reservations? What did you get? They’re going to get mighty tired of your changing our reservations all the times. We’d all like to be together if possible. If they have a double bed + a single in one room that would be all right. Charlotte and I could sleep on a windowsill. Honestly, honey, you and weather- It’s really pitiful. I do wish you’d carry a thermometer around with you for a few hours and find out the temperature is. Do you think the nights will stay real cool? My fur coat, haven’t worn it since you left. Gee, how exciting, a June bride by temperature. Honestly, what a wedding! Golly, nothing normal or usual ever happens to us. If you go over from the West Coast, darling, can I be with you in California until you go over? Then maybe I could study in California for a while and work in a B- 29 factory and do something to help you. I wouldn’t mind doing anything if it would help bring you home sooner. Honey, there isn’t much change of your going to Europe honey, is there? I wish they’d send you to England. At least you get home once in a while there. Well, honey 24 weeks will be over in about the end of August of the beginning of September. And you were the one who gave me the idea that you’d be in combat before October, honey. That’s one thing, honey, don’t try to keep anything from one for fear that I’ll worry or anything like that. Maybe I will to a certain extent but I’d be too busy being happy in the time that we had to worry about when you were going over. But, as you said, that’s a long way off, honey and we’ll think about that later. Gee, honey, in the movies they always think of so many ways to tell each other how much they love each other but I never can- Aught to change my writers- get new ideas. But I do love you so, darling. <b>Someday,</b> <b>maybe,</b> you’ll know how much. Every once in a while I just can’t believe that it’s happening to us. You’re so wonderful, honey and it just seems too wonderful to believe. Golly, March 11 th will certainly be some day for you. Getting your wings and married in the same day- within a few hours, too. I have to keep writing because I don’t have any envelope, I didn’t think so this will go on indefinitely, on second thought I’d better not- Have a few real tiny envelopes. Golly, darling, imagine us getting married. I still can’t believe it. It’s marvelous to be in love with you. You’re so wonderful and sweet. Did you get the rings yet honey? Don’t forget to tell me when you do. Oh, honey, please tell me about the scotch. I’ve got to know soon, honey or it will be too late to get any. May go to the movies with Daddy tomorrow night but I’ll write no matter how short it is. I love you more than anything in the world. I’ll love you with all my heart. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
