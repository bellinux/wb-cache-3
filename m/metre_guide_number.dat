50|$|Filters reduce <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> {{regardless}} of whether they are gels placed over the flash device or are on a camera lens. For instance a typical polarizing filter, which attenuates 1-1.5 fstops, will diminish <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> to 71-60% of their unfiltered rating.|$|R
50|$|Shoe Mount Flash: There {{are three}} types of FUJIFILM {{external}} flash, {{all of which are}} capable of high-precision TTL auto flash control. The EF-20 and EF-X20 both have a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 20, while EF-42 has a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 42.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose a {{photographer}} has a flash device with a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 44 (m)&thinsp;/&thinsp;144 (ft), [...] sets the camera’s aperture to , {{and wants to}} know the required flash-to-subject distance; he merely divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by 4. Thus, a subject 11 meters or 36 feet away will be correctly illuminated (GN&thinsp;44 (m)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;11 m, and GN&thinsp;144 (ft)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;36 ft). For the same <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> and an aperture of , the light source must be 5.5 meters or 18 feet from the subject.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler.|$|R
5000|$|High-end flash units {{address this}} problem by {{offering}} a mode, typically called FP sync or HSS (High Speed Sync), which fires the flash tube multiple times during the time the slit traverses the sensor. Such units require communication with the camera and are thus dedicated to a particular camera make. The multiple flashes result in {{a significant decrease in}} <b>guide</b> <b>number,</b> since each is only a part of the total flash power, but it's all that illuminates any particular part of the sensor. In general, if s is the shutter speed, and t is the shutter traverse time, the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by [...] For example, if the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 100, and the shutter traverse time is 5 ms (a shutter speed of 1/200s), and the shutter speed is set to 1/2000 s (0.5 ms), the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by a factor of , or about 3.16, so the resultant <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> at this speed would be about 32.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{if one has}} an {{established}} flash-to-subject distance and wants to find the required f-number, one divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by the distance. Example: <b>Guide</b> <b>number</b> = 48 (m) and the distance is 6 meters; one needs and aperture of [...] (GN&thinsp;48&thinsp;÷&thinsp;6 m&thinsp;=&thinsp;).|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your full-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 48 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the flash device is set to 1/16&thinsp;th power. Divide 1 by 16 to obtain 0.0625. Take the square root of that (the [...] button on a calculator), which equals 0.25, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 48 to obtain a reduced-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 12.0.|$|R
5000|$|Example: Suppose your full-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 51 {{and your}} flash device {{is set to}} 1/32&thinsp;nd power. Take the square root of 32 (the [...] button on a calculator), which equals {{approximately}} 5.657. Divide 51 by 5.657 to obtain a reduced-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 9.0.|$|R
50|$|Many flash {{devices have}} auto- or manual-adjust zoom {{features}} that permit the illumination angle to be widened (lessening the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> to fully illuminate the image area of wide-angle lenses, or narrowed (increasing the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> for telephoto lenses. Such coverage angles {{may be given}} in degrees but are often expressed as being equivalent to lens focal lengths for full-frame, 35 mm cameras. Manufacturers’ advertising practices vary as to the angle of coverage underlying their <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> ratings, {{in large part because}} some flash devices can be zoomed whereas others are fixed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 32 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the rated loss of the filter is 1.5 fstops. Take 0.5 and raise it {{to the power of}} 1.5 (using the [...] button on a scientific calculator), which equals roughly 0.35355. Take the square root of that (the [...] button), which equals approximately 0.595, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 32 to obtain a filtered <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 19.0.|$|R
50|$|The XA {{series was}} {{accompanied}} by a range of detachable flash units. The standard A11 took one AA battery and had a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 10. The A16 took two batteries and had a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 16. The A9M and A1L were smaller units for the XA1 and XA4 respectively.|$|R
50|$|In photography, the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> (GN) of {{electronic}} photoflash devices (lighting equipment {{also known as}} “studio strobes” and “speedlights”) is a measure for calculating flash exposures. <b>Guide</b> <b>numbers</b> allow photographers to quickly calculate either the required fstop for any given flash-to-subject distance, or the required distance for any given fstop.|$|R
50|$|When a flash {{device is}} used for filling in shadows (fill flash) in sunlit scenes, {{it is capable of}} doing so only at {{distances}} that are a function of its <b>guide</b> <b>number.</b> The maximum <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of the flash device establishes the maximum possible distance at which it can be used.|$|R
50|$|Current (2010) flash units {{frequently}} have much lower <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> in HSS mode than in normal modes, even at speeds below the shutter traverse time. For example, the Mecablitz 58 AF-1 digital flash unit has a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 58 in normal operation, but only 20 in HSS mode, even at low speeds.|$|R

50|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>number</b> {{distances}} {{are always}} measured from the flash device to the subject; if the flash device is {{detached from the}} camera, {{the position of the}} camera is irrelevant. Furthermore, unless a flash device has an automatic zoom feature that follows the setting of a camera’s zoom lens, <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> do not vary with the focal length of lenses.|$|R

50|$|Note that {{manufacturers}} of flash devices may provide <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> ratings specified relative to ISO 200, which increases {{them by the}} square root of the difference, or a 41 percent increase relative to those given at ISO 100. When comparing or shopping for flash devices, {{it is important to}} ensure that the <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> are given in the same ISO sensitivity, are for the same coverage angle, and reduce to the same unit of distance (meters or feet). When these three variables have been normalized, <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> can serve as an comparative measure of intrinsic illuminating energy rather than an inconstant metric for calculating exposures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} variables must necessarily affect <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in order}} to calculate proper exposures: ...|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, when {{comparing}} or shopping for flash devices with zoom heads, {{it would certainly}} be helpful {{if it were possible}} to mathematically convert advertised <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> from one manufacturer’s flash angle (zoom level) to another manufacturer’s flash angle. This is because <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> are often—though not always—given at their most zoomed setting and not all flash devices can zoom to the same extent.|$|R

50|$|Different {{models of}} flash devices {{available}} on the market have widely varying maximum-rated <b>guide</b> <b>numbers.</b> Powerful flash devices (those with inherently greater <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> when compared at the same ISO sensitivity and coverage angle) are especially useful for outdoor photography because photographers can increase the maximum flash-to-subject distance when filling in shadows. In large part, {{this is because the}} sun is such a bright, unadjustable light source against which a flash device must compete. However, a contributing factor is that many modern cameras with focal-plane shutters can sync with flash devices at speeds no faster than 1/60&thinsp;th of a second. Such a relatively long exposure requires particularly small apertures and/or low ISO sensitivities, both of which constrain how far a camera and its camera-mounted flash can be from the subject. See Fill flash: <b>Guide</b> <b>numbers</b> vs. distance, below.|$|R
