In the case of some commodities, however, the volatility in the future price has been substantially lower than the spot price indicating an inefficient utilisation of information. Several commodities also appear to attract wide speculative trading.

The main findings are as follows: First, in short run, the study finds its <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> International <b>liberalisation,</b> physical and human capital investment to have a significantly positive effect on the economic growth, and it <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> has no significantly positive effect on the economic growth.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} trade liberalisation on export growth, import growth, balance of payments and tax revenue of 28 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries from 1981 to 2010. Instead of relying on the Dean et al (1994) or Wacziarg and Welch (2008) liberalisation measures, we construct an index of trade liberalisation following a careful examination of trade policy reviews of sampled countries. Also, we adopt the average duties of exports and imports as additional <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation.</b> In Chapter two, we examine whether trade liberalisation has led to faster growth of imports than exports in Sub-Saharan Africa using fixed effects and generalised methods of moments estimators. Results show that imports grew faster than exports by approximately two percentage points which gives a preliminary indication that the trade balance of Sub-Saharan African countries declined following the adoption of freer trade policies. In addition, we found a low price elasticity of demand for exports which suggest that exports {{in the region are}} still mainly composed of primary commodities. The impact of trade liberalisation on the trade balance and the current account balance of Sub-Saharan African countries is examined in Chapter three of this thesis. Using a Pooled Mean Group estimator, results showed that the implementation of freer trade reforms has led to a deterioration of both the trade balance and the current account balance of SSA countries by 3. 5 and 2. 5 percentage points of GDP, respectively. In Chapter 4, the relationship between trade liberalisation and tax revenues is analysed for SSA countries using the fixed effects and generalised methods of moments estimators. We found that the reduction in average trade taxes has significantly decreased trade and total tax revenues as percentages of GDP; albeit, marginally increasing domestic tax revenues. Moreover, the removal of quantitative restrictions (that is, the liberalisation dummy) has led to an increase in total tax revenue of Sub-Saharan African countries...|$|E
40|$|With the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was {{inserted}} into {{the framework of the}} existing Common Commercial Policy (CCP) as Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 207 (1) TFEU provides: 1. The common commercial policy shall be based on uniform principles, particularly with regard to changes in tariff rates, the conclusion of tariff and trade agreements relating to trade in goods and services, and the commercial aspects of intellectual property, foreign direct investment, the achievement of uniformity in <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation,</b> export policy and measures to protect trade such as those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies. The common commercial policy shall be conducted {{in the context of the}} principles and objectives of the Union 2 ̆ 7 s external action. To many (member states) this new competence came as a surprise since it was not substantially debated during the Lisbon Treaty negotiations but seems to have entered the final text in a rather unnoticed fashion. Immediately after the entry-into-force of the Lisbon Treaty the debate focused on the scope of the new investment power and in particular on the limitation to FDI and its implications for the practice of EU treaty-making, whether the “new” EU investment power was limited to questions of market access or extended to the so-called post-investment phase as well, and whether future EU investment treaties would contain investor-State dispute settlement provisions. Meanwhile the EU Commission has strongly asserted its FDI powers under Article 207 (1) TFEU and plans to conclude treaties that cover the entire range of issues currently addressed in EU Member State BITs. Also the initial reluctance towards investor-State dispute settlement seems to have given way to a more positive attitude in this regard. In July 2010, the Commission issued some preliminary thoughts in a Communication which were taken up by the Council’s Conclusions of October 2010 and the Parliament’s Resolution of April 2011. While the Union is expected to issue more detailed documents by the end of 2012, this paper will discuss the potential shape of future EU investment treaties as far it can be discerned already. It will also address the underlying power struggle between the member states and the Union regarding the control over investment policy. At the same time, calls by various stakeholders for often conflicting goals, such as more protection against the “regulatory chill” of investment protection, more efficient tools to implement investor obligations and more effective enforcement of investment awards, will be addressed.

FRANCOISE DE BEL-AIR Introduction: {{migration}} {{and politics in}} the Middle East: populations, territories, citizenships {{at the dawn of}} the XXIst century. FRANCOISE DE BEL-AIR ET ARDA DERGARABEDIAN GLOBALISATION, INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND POLITICS: THE CASE OF QUALIFYING INDUSTRIAL ZONES (QIZS) IN JORDAN. Studies have illustrated the interdependence between migration movements and the far-reaching politico-economic revolution experienced nowadays by most developing countries: a switch from an unproductive to a privatised and liberalised economy, the opening of capital and attraction of FDIs as well as the introduction of productive, export-led and labour-intensive activities, that of the manufacturing industry and, especially, that of the textile and garment sector, for instance. In the context of post- 1999 ' QIZ compounds in Jordan, we show that the implementation of these economic measures, as well as of the political choices underlying them, quasi-structurally depend on the attraction of Asian immigrant manpower. This process allows for Jordan's anchorage into a "de-territorialised" worldwide network of trade, subcontracting as well as manpower import and export, and for the quick implementation of drastic economic <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation.</b> However, the Jordanian population, though it suffers from high unemployment rates, does not benefit from the economic and employment reform process, a situation which illustrates the notion of "liberal paradox". Moreover, these reforms avoid the political sphere, as this new class of workers enjoys neither political nor social rights. The "mobility of labour and capital" thus crystallises, on the Jordanian ground, all the political stakes of shifting from a rent-based to a productive economic system, even though it proved one of the instruments of the transition process. KNUT BERGEM THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN THE IN-MIGRATION OF DOMESTIC WORKERS TO JORDAN AND THE GCC COUNTRIES More than 2 million Asian women are currently employed as domestic workers in Jordan and the Gulf-countries. The institution of domestic service in these countries has, accordingly, become intimately intertwined with state immigration policies. It has also become part of "internal affairs". The availability of foreign domestic workers can be seen as part of a social contract between the authorities and the middle classes, by which the state provide an easy and comfortable life for their nationals, in exchange for political support. On this background, the article addresses some of the structural problems facing the foreign domestic workers, and takes a critical look at the current immigration- and employment-practises shaping their stay. In significant ways, the article argues, foreign maids are kept out of society by being deprived of basic human rights or proper labour protection. Both the state and national employers benefit from this situation, each in their different ways, as will be shown. Finally, the article discusses possible ways to create a more humane immigration system for foreign domestic workers in the region. JOHN CHALCRAFT SYRIAN WORKERS IN LEBANON AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE. POLITICAL ECONOMY AND POPULAR ASPIRATIONS What role has the state played in the migration to Lebanon and return of hundreds of thousands of unskilled Syrians during the 1990 s? A dominant view accredits the Syrian state with enormous power in imposing a 'flood' of Syrian migrants on Lebanon. A less popular 'pro-Syrian' position counters that the division of labour accounts for Syrian migration. Ostensibly, the fact that the migration continued even after Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon in April 2005 vindicates the economic explanation. However, to accept this answer would be to accept uncritically the terms of the debate, efface the importance of state power, and assume too much about the explanatory status of 'the economy'. This chapter goes beyond the terms of the existing controversy, arguing that standing behind the economy we find the state, especially if we extend the chronological perspective, consider policies not usually considered directly relevant to migration, and pay attention to popular aspirations driving {{migration and}} return. I argue that state policy is far more important than any economistic reading claims, but its importance is not in 'imposing' workers on Lebanon. In fact, divergent social and economic policies pursued by Syria and Lebanon since the 1960 s account for the cycle of Syrian migration and return as much as any purely economic factors. JALAL AL-HUSSEINI THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE ISSUE IN THE ARAB STATES: IN SEARCH OF AN UNEASY EQUILIBRIUM. The paper deals with the immigration policies that the Arab states neighbouring Israel (Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) have adopted vis-à-vis the Palestinian refugees since 1948. More particularly, it aims at determining how these policies, be they elaborated by the Arab League or by each of the host authorities, have reflected and impacted on the latter's nation building endeavour. We show that far from merely responding to external considerations related to the Arab-Israeli conflict, these policies have been closely linked to country-specific or regional concerns –and dilemmas- regarding the consolidation of national identity, and political, social and financial stability. In so doing, the paper strays from the view widely shared in Israel and the Western world according to which the Arab countries had only been led by a desire to instrumentalize the refugee issue within the framework of future peace negotiations. Whereas this interpretation should not be discarded altogether, the paper argues that it is primarily in the light of a search for an internal equilibrium taking into account the various socioeconomic and political constraints (and opportunities) incurred by the immigration and settlement of the Palestinian refugees in their territory that the policies pursued by these countries should be considered. KAMAL DORAÏ and OLIVIER CLOCHARD NON-PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN LEBANON. FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS TO ILLEGAL MIGRANTS While nearly 400, 000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon, this country host non-Palestinian refugees, whose number rises from a few thousands recognised by the UNHCR up to 30, 000 or 40, 000 according to non-official sources that include many 'irregular' migrants mainly coming from Iraq and Sudan. To some extend, Lebanon is considered as a destination country where refugees can find a temporal asylum before returning to their country of origin. But for many others Lebanon is considered as a transit country towards Western Europe, North America or Australia. What are the different itineraries that exist? Do they rely on transnational networks? What are the bases of these networks? The transit period can last several months and refugees have to adopt coping strategies while their statuses are extremely precarious. What kinds of strategies are developed in different spheres such as accommodation, work, health, education, etc. ? Based on empirical data, this paper aims to address the theoretical issue of studying refugee movements in relation with the development of transnational practices in the Middle East. SARI HANAFI PALESTINIAN REFUGEES, CITIZENSHIP AND THE NATION-STATE In the Bethlehem Fatah communiqué, the authors considered the Palestinian state as a substitute for the right of return. But is there a solution that encompasses the right of return and a Palestinian state? The question is not only one of right or the number of eventual returnees or the technical economic and social capacity for absorption, but is also a question of the nature of both the Palestinian and the Israeli nation-states, the concept of state sovereignty and its inherent violence, and the inclusion/exclusion that the state exercises to determine who is a citizen. The objective of this article is to demonstrate that so far, while transnational strategies adopted by refugees/returnees/transmigrants themselves are generally flexible, the policies of the nation-states in the region are inflexible. I will demonstrate also that the current nation-state model which is based on the "trinity" of nation-state-territory is unadapted to proposing a solution for the Palestinian refugees problem and that a new model of nation state must be conceptualized, based on flexible borders, flexible citizenship and some kind of separation between the nation and state, what I will call the extra-territorial nation state. THIBAUT JAULIN EMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY: A CASE-STUDY OF LEBANESE-DESCENT' INDIVIDUALS On what conditions can an American, a Brazilian or an Australian descendant from an emigrant of Lebanese origin obtain the nationality of his country of origin? The attribution of the Lebanese nationality to members of the large Lebanese Diaspora was the subject of very passionate debate, which took place in the context of a reform of the law on nationality and the controversial decree of naturalization in 1994. In this text, I'll show that the political issues raised by the question of the naturalization of the so-called "descendants of Lebanese origin" are intertwined with different aspects of the Lebanese national construction, namely, the demographical balance between the different religious communities, the definition of the national identity, and the juridical principles to grant the nationality. PAUL TABAR THE MARONITE CHURCH IN LEBANON. FROM NATION-BUILDING TO A DIASPORAN/TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTION In this chapter the author examines changes within the Maronite Church, which are transforming it into a nation-building and a diasporan institution. These changes are caused by the growing influence of the Maronite diaspora on the Church and the de-territorialising impact of migration on the Lebanese abroad. In this connection, the Church is best understood as a globalocal institution: on one hand, it restores links of the Maronite diasporan communities to the mother Church in Lebanon, and on the other, it becomes diasporic by developing its institutional presence abroad and responding increasingly to the needs of the Maronite diaspora in various parts of the world. The Maronite Patriarchal Council that was held in Lebanon between 2003 - 2004, and the Maronite Church in Australia are examined to substantiate the above claims. Migration et politique au Moyen-Orient. Les migrations internationales constituent aujourd'hui, dans toutes les régions du globe, un enjeu majeur du politique. Elles font l'objet d'accords internationaux, engendrent des litiges diplomatiques et, surtout, défient en permanence l'ordre du « national ». L'immigrant se heurte à des frontières, spatiales et administratives; l'émigrant renégocie en permanence ses relations à son pays d'origine. Aussi les migrations obligent-elles sans cesse à repenser les frontières, les manières de conceptualiser un territoire et, plus largement, la souveraineté politique d'un État-nation. Dans un Moyen-Orient arabe en pleine crise sociale, économique et politique, l'intensification des mouvements d'immigration et d'émigration, mais aussi celle des migrations de transit, est porteuse, en ce tournant de siècle, d'enjeux politiques spécifiques. L'implication accrue des diasporas dans les pays de départ, l'exploitation persistante des migrants dits « de travail », la présence des réfugiés de Palestine et, depuis peu, d'Irak ou du Soudan, les débats populaires que suscitent ces sujets, y posent de façon renouvelée la question du politique, des définitions de la nation à l'inscription régionale et internationale des Etats. Dans ce contexte émergent de nouveaux modes d'instrumentalisation, par les acteurs du politique, des mouvements migratoires intra-régionaux et internationaux, dont ce livre explore des exemples significatifs : « mobilité du travail et du capital » comme stratégie de politique intérieure et étrangère en Jordanie, rôle des États dans les migrations de travail (travail domestique en Jordanie et dans les pays du Golfe; main-d'œuvre syrienne au Liban), gestion des réfugiés palestiniens dans les pays arabes, défi posé par les membres de cette diaspora à la rigidité des concepts de frontière et de citoyenneté portés par les acteurs du processus de paix, sort des réfugiés non palestiniens au Liban, caractère éminemment politique des débats sur la nationalité dans ce pays, rôle de l'Église maronite, acteur désormais transnational, sur la scène politique libanaise [...] . Discours sur, représentation d'une identité nationale, instrument de politique intérieure mais aussi stratégie de relations internationales, les mesures de contrôle et de gestion des flux migratoires mettent en relief la pluralité croissante des notions de nationalité, de population nationale, de territoire, de même que les changements qui affectent les modalités du « contrat social ». Elles montrent la résilience des États et l'émergence de nouveaux acteurs dans la sphère du politique : réseaux ethnico-nationaux, religieux, réseaux d'affaires transnationaux [...] . Les politiques migratoires éclairent ainsi de façon particulière les processus de construction nationale et de restructuration géopolitique à l'œuvre dans la région. FRANCOISE DE BEL-AIR : Introduction : Migration et politique au Moyen-Orient. Populations, territoires et citoyennetés à l'aube du XXIème siècle. FRANCOISE DE BEL-AIR ET ARDA DERGARABEDIAN GLOBALISATION, MIGRATIONS INTERNATIONALES ET POLITIQUE : LE CAS DES ZONES INDUSTRIELLES QUALIFIANTES (QIZ) DE JORDANIE Des travaux ont illustré l'interdépendance entre les mouvements migratoires et la profonde révolution politico-économique vécue de nos jours par la plupart des Etats en développement : le passage d'une économie non-productive à un système libéral, privatisé, attirant les Investissements étrangers directs et favorisant la mise en place de structures de production tournées vers l'exportation et pourvoyeuses d'emplois, dont l'industrie manufacturière du textile et de l'habillement constitue un exemple. Dans le contexte de la Jordanie de l'après- 1999, on montre ici, à travers l'exemple des QIZ, que la mise en œuvre de ces mesures mais surtout le succès des stratégies politiques y étant associées dépendent quasi-structurellement d'un recours à une main-d'œuvre immigrée asiatique. Ce processus permet l'ancrage de la Jordanie dans un réseau "déterritorialisé" d'échange de biens et de personnes, de même que l'application rapide de mesures de libéralisation drastiques. Pourtant, il s'effectue sans la participation de la population jordanienne, qui souffre de taux de chômage élevés, un exemple de "paradoxe libéral". Les réformes évitent aussi la sphère du politique, cette nouvelle classe de travailleurs ne jouissant d'aucun droit politique et social. La "mobilité du travail et du capital" apparaît donc sur ce terrain comme le catalyseur de tous les enjeux politiques du passage d'un système économique rentier à un système productif, mais aussi comme l'un des instruments privilégiés de cette transition. KNUT BERGEM LE ROLE DE L'ETAT DANS L'IMMIGRATION DES TRAVAILLEURS DOMESTIQUES EN JORDANIE ET DANS LES PAYS DU GOLFE Plus de 2 millions de femmes asiatiques sont actuellement employées en tant que travailleuses domestiques en Jordanie et dans les Etats du Golfe. L'institution des services domestiques, dès lors, est devenue un élément à part entière des politiques étatiques d'immigration, comme de la politique intérieure des pays concernés. La disponibilité de travailleuses domestiques étrangères peut être envisagée en termes de "contrat social" entre les régimes et les classes moyennes, selon lequel l'Etat garantit un confort matériel aux citoyens en échange de leur allégeance politique. Dans ce cadre, cette contribution aborde certains problèmes structurels auxquels sont confrontées les travailleuses domestiques. Il questionne les politiques actuelles d'immigration de même que les pratiques encadrant leur séjour. L'article met en relief l'aspect structurel de l'isolement social comme de l'absence de politiques de protection des droits humains ou de loi du travail appliqués aux employés de ce secteur. Le profit politique engendré par cette situation, pour les Etats et employeurs des pays d'accueil, y est éclairé. L'article propose également quelques pistes pour l'élaboration de politiques plus humaines d'immigration de travailleurs domestiques vers la région. JOHN CHALCRAFT LES TRAVAILLEURS SYRIENS AU LIBAN ET LE ROLE DE L'ETAT. ECONOMIE POLITIQUE, AMBITIONS POPULAIRES Quel est le rôle joué par les Etats dans la migration vers le Liban, au cours des années 1990, de centaines de milliers de travailleurs non qualifiés syriens ? Les théories les plus courantes créditent l'Etat syrien d'un pouvoir colossal, celui d'imposer au Liban un "flot" de migrants syriens. Une position plus "pro-syrienne", plus rarement défendue, oppose à cette explication politique le rôle de la division du travail comme moteur des migrations syriennes. La poursuite des mouvements de travailleurs syriens vers le pays voisin après le retrait d'avril 2005 semble confirmer la véracité de cette perception, en termes économiques, des flux migratoires entre les deux pays. Pourtant, outre qu'elle repose sur un débat dont les termes restent à questionner, cette explication passe sous silence le pouvoir des Etats et surestime la capacité explicative de l'économie comme discipline scientifique. Cette contribution dépasse les termes de la controverse existante et cherche à mettre en relief le rôle de l'Etat dans l'économie, par un retour sur l'histoire des relations entre les deux pays, par une attention portée aux politiques économiques sans rapport direct avec les migrations et par la prise en compte des ambitions des acteurs sous-tendant les mouvements d'émigration et de retour. J'avance la théorie suivante : les politiques d'Etat ont plus d'effets que ne leur prêtent les lectures "économicistes" du phénomène migratoire, mais pas celui d'"imposer" au Liban des travailleurs immigrés. Mieux que des facteurs purement économiques, les politiques économiques et sociales divergentes menées par les deux pays depuis les années 1960 permettent d'expliquent les aléas des mouvements migratoires et de retour entre la Syrie et le Liban. JALAL AL-HUSSEINI LA GESTION DE LA QUESTION DES REFUGIES PALESTINIENS DANS LES PAYS ARABES : A LA RECHERCHE D'UN EQUILIBRE INCERTAIN Cet article se penche sur les politiques de gestion de l'immigration des réfugiés palestiniens que les pays arabes voisins d'Israël (la Jordanie, le Liban et la Syrie) ont adoptées depuis 1948. Plus précisément, il s'agit de déterminer comment ces politiques, élaborées par la Ligue arabe ou par les autorités hôtes, se sont reflétées sur le processus de construction nationale développées par ces dernières. Nous chercherons à montrer que loin de n'être que des réponses à des considérations externes liées au conflit israélo-arabe, ces politiques ont été intimement liées à des préoccupations locales et régionales ayant trait à la consolidation de l'identité nationale, ainsi qu'à la stabilité politique, sociale et financière des pays concernés. Ce faisant, nous nous écartons des analyses largement partagées en Israël et dans le monde occidental selon lesquelles les pays arabes n'auraient été guidés que par le désir d'instrumentaliser la question des réfugiés dans le cadre de futures négociations de paix. Sans rejeter totalement cette interprétation, nous avançons que c'est avant tout à la lumière de la recherche d'un équilibre minimal tenant compte des contraintes (et opportunités) politiques et socioéconomiques induite par la présence des réfugiés sur leur territoire que la politique des pays arabes en matière devrait être analysée. KAMAL DORAÏ ET OLIVIER CLOCHARD LES REFUGIES NON-PALESTINIENS DU LIBAN. DU STATUT DE DEMANDEURS D'ASILE A CELUI DE MIGRANTS ILLEGAUX Environ 400 000 réfugiés palestiniens vivent actuellement au Liban, un pays qui abrite par ailleurs des réfugiés non-palestiniens, dont les effectifs varient de quelques milliers reconnus par le Haut Commissariat des Nations-Unies aux Réfugiés (UNHCR) à 30 - 40 000 selon des sources non-officielles, incluant de nombreux migrants "illégaux", principalement originaires du Soudan et d'Irak. Le Liban peut être considéré comme un pays d'asile temporaire avant un retour des réfugiés vers leur pays d'origine. Il peut aussi dans d'autres cas constituer un pays de transit vers l'Europe de l'ouest, l'Amérique du nord ou l'Australie. Quels sont les divers itinéraires existants ? Reposent-ils sur des réseaux transnationaux ? Quelles sont les bases de ces réseaux ? La période de transit pouvant durer plusieurs mois, les réfugiés doivent concevoir des stratégies d'adaptation, leurs statuts restant très précaires. Quelles stratégies sont adoptées dans divers domaines, logement, emploi, santé, éducation, etc. ?

It <b>measures</b> the proliferation <b>of</b> regulatory authorities, the degree of specialisation of the tasks assumed by each authority and the coordination between them, as well as the centrality of the main regulators within the arrangement.

These agencies did not involve themselves directly in the garment industry, but dictated a series of radical changes in the country’s economic policies, which in turn, allowed the garment industry to make advances that would otherwise not have been possible. At the same time, however, the process <b>of</b> economic <b>liberalisation</b> led by the IFIs is also accused for the structural insecurity and the frequen...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Capital market integration, Cost {{of equity}} capital, Time-varying integration. International asset pricing theory {{suggests}} that capital market liberalisation will {{reduce the cost of}} domestic equity capital through increased international diversification by domestic and international investors. For a liberalising country, this will {{have a positive effect on}} domestic investment. Existing empirical evidence provides only partial support to this prediction. Some studies register a decrease in the cost of equity, but to a lesser extent than is predicted by theory. The results are also sensitive to different specifications <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> dates and assumptions about the pre- and post-liberalisation degree of integration. In this paper, we review and analyse existing theoretical and empirical evidence on the behaviour of asset returns in a liberalising country with special reference to the nature of integration process. We argue that stock market liberalisation is a gradual process and cannot be analysed using event study methods. Instead, the time-variation in the degree of integration should be explicitly defined when <b>measuring</b> the impact <b>of</b> <b>liberalisations</b> on asset returns and the cost of capital. We also discuss alternative methods for modelling the time-varying integration in asset pricing models. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this dissertation are: (1) To analyse {{the pre and}} post privatisation and deregulation performance of two United Kingdom industries from the transport sector. (2) To analyse the earning and employment in these industries prior to deregulation and/or privatisation, and to examine {{what has happened to}} them after these changes. (3) To investigate any changes that have occurred in trade union density in these industries compared with {{what has happened in the}} rest of the economy. (4) To see if there was any evidence of rent sharing prior to privatisation and deregulation. If it did exist, did it continue after privatisation and deregulation, or was it substantially reduced or eliminated. The methodology of the dissertation is eclectic, so it examined these issues from a number of different perspectives, and its contribution to knowledge is incremental. In regard to the bus and coach industry in the newly competitive period following deregulation and privatisation, the major firms emerged almost solely through external rather than organic growth. This went against one of the main aims of privatisation, which was to create a competitive industry of many small-to-medium sized operations. Privatisation and deregulation also failed to stop the decline in passenger numbers, which was another objective of the programme. In the case of the UK ports, it is extremely difficult to conclude that the changing ownership constituted a significant factor in port performance and efficiency. Instead, factors such as geographical location and labour market deregulation seems to have had a greater influence on efficiency in the ports. That the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> most associated with privatisation, and that offered the most in terms of potential gains in efficiency, were those on which major concessions had to be made by the Government to win management support for the political process of privatisation. If managerial support for privatisation was absent then process was unlikely to occur. The underlying success of deregulation and privatisation in these industries has been in reducing the power of trade unions to obtain rent for their members, which was one of the main, if understated aims of the policy.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} international evidence {{relating to}} the impact <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> on banking sector performance. Compared to {{a large number of}} studies linking financial liberalisation to economic growth and financial fragility, there is relatively little research at the international level linking financial liberalisation to banking sector efficiency and productivity. The research contributes to the literature by making a systematic, cross-country empirical investigation using domestic and international <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> and evaluates their impact on bank efficiency and productivity by applying a combination of frontier estimation methods, dynamic panel data regressions and Granger causality techniques. The evidence is based on the use of bank-level accounting data and country-level economic data for a sample of 1536 commercial banks covering 88 countries over the period 2000 to 2009. Apart from using the global frontier for estimation of bank efficiency, empirical analysis is conducted across various levels including the use of separate income-group frontiers to determine the robustness of the findings. Using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) for the estimation of banks’ cost and profit efficiency, the evidence shows that financial liberalisation contributes positively to profit efficiency while the effect on cost efficiency is generally mixed, depending on the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> used. Additionally, the results show that while cost efficiency remains, on average, stable during the estimation period (2000 - 2009), average profit efficiency fluctuates in the pre-crises period (2000 - 06) but declines sharply during the post crises period (2007 - 09). Furthermore, accounting explicitly for the influence of risk in banking, the evidence suggests that financial liberalisation, lower cost efficiency and higher profit efficiency of banks all increase the potential for default risk, while the latter also reduces both cost and profit efficiency, providing support for the bad management hypothesis. Additionally, upon accounting explicitly for the role of market power or competition in banking, the evidence suggests that both financial liberalisation and greater market power contribute to higher default risk of banks. On the other hand, greater competition in banking contributes to higher cost but lower profit efficiency of banks under financial liberalisation. The cross-country empirical investigation is also extended to analyse the impact <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> on banks’ technical efficiency and productivity growth, using a two-step approach of combining data envelopment analysis (DEA) with panel data regressions. The evidence here suggests that financial liberalisation is robustly and negatively associated with (pure) technical efficiency. Furthermore, the effect on the total factor productivity (TFP) growth (using two-step DEA-type Malmquist method) is positive, although not always statistically significant. The robustness analysis conducted across the different income groups (higher, upper-middle, lower-middle and lower) confirms that the impact on cost, profit and technical efficiency of banks is more pronounced in the more developed (higher and upper-middle) countries than in the less developed countries. In particular, the impact <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> is largely insignificant in the lower income countries. This finding generally reflects the greater pace <b>of</b> capital account <b>liberalisation</b> in the higher and upper-middle income countries, where the impact on both cost and profit efficiency is positive. Throughout the analysis, the estimation takes into account country-specific differences in the regulatory, market structure, financial development and macro-economic conditions and the evidence shows that these influences are also mostly significant and robust under financial liberalisation. Hence, the thesis concludes by arguing that financial liberalisation exerts an independent effect on the cost, profit and technical efficiency of banks, while the risks associated with financial liberalisation should be mitigated with better regulatory and institutional structures...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between trade liberalisation and intra-regional trade in some selected ECOWAS member countries, with particular focus on the role of applied and most favoured nation import tariffs. Design/methodology/approach - Data utilized were sourced from the World Bank's World Development and Governance Indicators, Mayer and Zignago (2006) distance index as well as the World Trade Organisation's World Integrated Trade System (WiTs). The sample period consists of 8 countries covering the years 1998 to 2011. Predicated on a gravity framework, system and difference generalised method of moments dynamic panel data estimators were relied upon. Findings - The empirical results showed that trade liberalisation has contributed to intra-regional trade in the West African sub-region. The potency <b>of</b> trade <b>liberalisation</b> was relatively more pronounced through the use of most favoured nation import tariff compared to applied import tariff rates. Our results also showed that improved institutional quality and infrastructure are associated with higher intra-ECOWAS trade. Furthermore, using alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> institutional quality and infrastructure as well as fixed and random effect estimators validated our findings. Research limitations/implications - Data limitations led to the inclusion of only 8 out of the 15 ECOWAS member countries in the sample. The research was also limited to tariff barriers as <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>liberalisation.</b> The same methodology can be applied as data becomes available while a consideration of non-tariff barriers could provide more insights on the dynamics of intra-ECOWAS trade. Originality/value - The findings reinforce the notion that removal of trade restrictions particularly in the manufacturing sector, good governance and infrastructural developments enhance trade amongst ECOWAS countries...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} long debated in {{economic}} literature whether financial markets {{play a significant}} role in economic growth and development. [For review see Gertler (1988) and Levine (1997) ]. Findings of some recent empirical literature show that well-functioning financial system plays an instrumental role in economic growth, and the causality runs from finance to growth [for cross country evidences see King and Levine (1993, 1993 a); Levine and Zervos (1998); Levine, Loayza and Beck (1999); Beck, Levine, and Loayza (1999) ]. This, in turn, has led to a search for the key factors that determine the better functioning financial markets. Within the banking sector, efficiency is the core concern of both academics and bank officials. A number of studies have sought to <b>measure</b> the efficiency <b>of</b> financial institutions, to identify the factors that contribute to efficiency of financial system, and to recommend the ways to attain the peer group efficiency levels [Berg (1993); Leaven (1999); Berger and Mester (1997); Miller and Noulas (1996) ]. These empirical findings suggest a healthy competitive financial market pave the way for efficient market participants that leads to overall efficiency of the system and hence productivity. Following this notion, <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> financial markets has been initiated to improve the performance of financial institutions both in developed and developing countries. Some empirical tests have been carried out to <b>measure</b> the effects <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> and deregulation <b>of</b> financial institutions on the efficiency and productivity of banking sector. ...|$|R

This paper builds on the literature on small economies to classify economy size according to economic, demographic, and geographical measures in order to empirically examine whether small size affects the effective culmination <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> telecommunications. A cluster of small economies that have a maximum population of 9. 2 million (Guinea), GDP of US $ 86. 17 billion (Singapore), and arable area of 19. 3 Â thousandÂ km 2 (Central African Republic) are the main focus of analysis.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the overall impact <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> on Nepal�s financial system and economy. The study is specifically directed towards analysing the rationale of executing a financial liberalisation policy; preparing {{an account of}} the evolution, process and sequencing of the financial liberalisation; and evaluating the impact <b>of</b> the various <b>liberalisation</b> <b>measures</b> on financial and economic developments of Nepal with cointegration and causality tests. The study makes significant contributions {{in the area of the}} impact evaluation <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation.</b> Most <b>of</b> the previous studies focus on the economic growth aspect <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> in detail, but attach less importance to the redistribution of income and stability of the financial systems. To bridge this gap, an aggregated framework for impact evaluation, which includes all of the three dimensions, is implemented in this study. The framework implemented in this study is useful not only for the impact evaluation <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> policy, but also for other public policies. A summary index <b>of</b> the financial <b>liberalisation</b> comprising eight policy instruments is employed in this study. As some of these instruments have not been immediately fully employed, the index is designed to take into account their gradual implementation. The instruments are interest rate deregulation, removal of entry barriers, reduction in reserve requirement, easing in credit controls, implementation of prudential rules, stock market reform, privatisation of state-owned banks and external account liberalisation. A sequential procedure has been applied to test for unit roots on time series data. This procedure helps to determine the optimal test method for each time series under consideration and reduces the risk of model misspecification and biased results. The empirical test results obtained using the Nepalese quarterly data from 1970 - 2003 suggest that financial liberalisation in Nepal has had a mixed impact on the financial system and the national economy. The number of per capita bank branches is found to be positively associated with the widening of the financial sector, which in turn affects financial development positively. The real deposit interest rate affects the volume of time deposits (savings) positively, but the increase in gross domestic product does not affect time deposits. The volume of time deposits affects the volume of bank loans positively, but the lending rate does not have a significant impact on the volume of bank loans. Collectively, the financial liberalisation measures are positively associated with per capita income as well as with industrial development. The population density per bank branch is found to be positively associated with the volume of bank credit to the poor, while the overall <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> are negatively associated with such credit. The results also suggest that financial liberalisation is positively associated with the credit-deposit ratio of the commercial banks. However, the higher credit-deposit ratio is not only associated with higher return, but also with higher risk. Therefore, it can be argued that financial liberalisation has brought instability in the Nepalese financial sector. The overall finding of this study is that financial liberalisation is positively associated with growth, but negatively associated with income equality and financial stability. However, the study does not find any causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in Nepal. Hence, the financial liberalisation in Nepal has not facilitated a financial development to the extend that contributed significantly to the economic development of the country...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to show the effects <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> on emerging market economies, how these economies removed restrictions on financial institutions {{so that they can be}} globally integrated, and to show the flow of international finance in and out of a country. This research also illustrates how the financial system in these economies moved from being government-led to being market-led. The main finding of {{this research}} is that many countries failed to reap the benefits <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> because <b>of</b> weaknesses in the regulatory structure, undercapitalised banks, volatile markets and contagion effects. The research concludes that the long-term gains <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> certainly supersede short-term instability <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation.</b> Thus, for financial liberalisation to have predominantly positive effects, attention should be drawn to the importance of a more prudent regulatory and supervisory environment. Furthermore, financial liberalisation must be accompanied by a sound institutional infrastructure, proper conduct of monetary and fiscal policies, a reduction in corruption, and an increase in transparency. In addition, liberalisation should be a gradual process whereby the right measures are taken in the right sequence. EconomicsM. Comm. (Economics...|$|R
