This was the second time the reed bed had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all.

5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

40|$|Deslanting the Lens {{examines}} {{the historical and}} sociological implications of how Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> represented in popular American film. From {{the early days of}} “yellowface” to caricatures like Long Duck Dong, Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relegated to perpetual foreigner status in American cinema. This paper will explore why the portrayal of Asian <b>men</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> limited to very specific ideas about Asian and Asian Americans are in society. This analysis will also include how socio/political events have shaped and influence popular perceptions about Asians, that inform how Asian men continue to be depicted in film...|$|R

5|$|In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica. Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that he and Scully have been denied reassignment to the division. Mulder goes to his former basement office, {{only to discover that}} Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned to the X-Files. Going against orders, Mulder and Scully track down an escaped alien in Phoenix, Arizona while Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) gives chase. Mulder and Scully eventually discover that Cigarette Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> using Gibson Praise to locate the creature. Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood. Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals.|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cast on the show because heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian <b>man</b> <b>has</b> never <b>been</b> cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|R

5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E
