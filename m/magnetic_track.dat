We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} to perform real time image-based tracking on streaming 4 D ultrasound data, using image registration to deduce the positioning of each ultrasound frame {{in a global}} coordinate system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{how to use the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> {{technique}} for indoor navigation. The six degrees of freedom (6 DoF) <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> technology is selected because it is less influenced by the environment and has the highest accuracy among other techniques. A new method is proposed, called the alternating direct current (ADC) method, which permits one to get a double update rate, reduce the influence of Earth's magnetic field by a factor of 2 and reduce the power consumption by a factor of 3. The theoretical basis of the new <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> method is given, including a mathematical modeling of the local field, a mathematical model of the measurement of the positioning field by a 3 -D transducer based on the Hall effect sensors, and the mathematical model for the estimation of the measurement errors. A new, net-like source of the positioning local magnetic field is proposed for indoor navigation with a scalable coverage area. A mathematical model of the distributed positioning field is given. The results of simulations are shown...|$|R

The overview includes {{an analysis of the}} Polhemus Fastrak, the development of mathematical models and algorithms used for <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> and the design of test jigs used to verify the results. An original non-iterative tracking algorithm that allows sensor position and orientation to be calculated in rotation matrix form is developed and verified.

40|$|In a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system, the {{position}} and orientation of a coil is determined by its low frequency (LF) magnetic interactions with a coil array of known position and orientation. There are two main types of systems: (i) the coil with unknown position works as a transmitter with a receiving array of sensors, or (ii) the coil array is the transmitter and the coil with unknown position is used as sensor. As LF magnetic fields do not interact with the human body, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> is particularly well-suited for tracking of objects {{in and around the}} human body. For example, this tracking technique has in recent years been proposed for eye tracking, tracking of tongue movements, and organ-positioning during radiotherapy. We focus on an organ-positioning system for use during radiotherapy. The system, which is of type (i) above, consists of a transmitter that is implanted near the organ of interest and an external array of sensors. Of particular interest is the spatial layout of the sensor array, since this strongly influences the performance of the tracking system. A well-designed sensor array will give good positioning accuracy whereas an ill-designed array can result in an unsolvable positioning problem. In this work, we use Fisher-information theory from the field of optimal measurements to formulate an optimization problem for the layout of the sensor array. Furthermore, we solve the optimization problem and discuss the implications of the results on the design of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> systems...|$|R

In this paper we will give a detailed presentation of the results of this experiment. From the results of this experiment we conclude that most of the applied design criteria have led to an i mproved input device...|$|R
40|$|Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) requires real-time tumor tracking to allow precise {{delivery of the}} prescribed dose of radiation to the tumor and reduce damage to the surrounding tissue. A small size and low power wireless active transponder implanted {{in the vicinity of}} the tumor with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system placed outside the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body can be used to locate the position of the tumor during the {{radiation therapy}}. The wireless active transponder uses a magnetic sensor to sense the magnetic field generated by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system, and then transmits the magnetic field information back to the computer wirelessly using on/off keying (OOK) for tumor tracking. One of the challenges faced by an implantable device is that the device must consume as little power as possible for prolonged battery lifetime or battery-less remote-powered operations. To significantly reduce the power consumption of the wireless transponder, various low-voltage low-power design techniques are proposed in this dissertation. These techniques include low-voltage designs, time-division scheme, a low-power low-area-penalty sensor front-end topology, and low-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Using these low-power techniques, a wireless active transponder is implemented in 130 -nm CMOS technology. The developed wireless active transponder consumes only 912 μW, and does not use any area-intensive integrated inductors. This ultra-low-power wireless inductorless active transponder only occupies an area of less than 4 mm 2. Measurements show that the wireless transponder is able to provide tumor tracking with an error of less than 5 mm using the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tracking</b> system. ...|$|R

The braking distance will be approximately 250 m at 100 km/h and 600 m at 160 km/h. High-speed trains are usually equipped with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> brake, which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances like 850 m at 200 km/h and 1900 m at 300 km/h.|$|E
