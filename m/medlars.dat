5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and <b>medlars.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common <b>medlars.</b> The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E
5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, <b>medlars,</b> crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

40|$|Quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) and <b>medlar</b> (Mespilus germanica L.) are not {{indigenous}} {{species in the}} Czech Republic. However, both taxa are cultivated {{there for a long}} time. Quince probably originates from Iraq, Caucasus, Asia Minor and partly from Arabian Peninsula. <b>Medlar</b> is probably native in south-east Europe and Armenia, probably from other parts of Caucasus and north Iraq, too. Both species have uncommon fruit. The aim of the Bachelor Thesis was to create a list of localities of quince and <b>medlar</b> which have been known in the Czech Republic so far. It was based on written documents and herbarium specimens from several public herbaria. I found 145 and 106 localities for quince and <b>medlar,</b> respectivelly. In addition, 8 new findings for quince and 3 for <b>medlar</b> are reported. They are all based on field work including data stated by other persons...|$|R
25|$|In the Caucasus, jackals mainly hunt hares, small rodents, pheasants, partridges, ducks, coots, moorhens and passerines. They readily eat lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, {{molluscs}} and insects. During {{the winter}} period, they will kill many nutrias and waterfowl. During such times, jackals will surplus kill and cache {{what they do}} not eat. Jackals will feed on fruits such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood and the cones of Common <b>Medlars.</b> European jackals tend not to be as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes are, though they can become a serious nuisance to small sized stock when in high numbers. The highest number of livestock damages occurred in southern Bulgaria: 1,053 attacks on small stock, mainly sheep and lambs, were recorded between 1982–87, along with some damages to newborn deer in game farms.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the great city, there was a royal hunting park and a garden that included [...] "all the aromatic plants of Hatti and the fruit-trees of every mountain", a [...] "record of power and conquest", as Robin Lane Fox has observed.

60|$|So the {{old woman}} {{opened the door and}} Maria slept in her house. The king was very angry at her for playing truant, but when she {{returned}} home the next day, she found the plants of her sisters withered away, because they had disobeyed their father. Now the window in the room of the eldest overlooked the gardens of the king, and when she saw how fine and ripe the <b>medlars</b> were on the trees, she longed to eat some, and begged Maria to scramble down by a rope and pick her a few, and she would draw her up again. Maria, who was good-natured, swung herself into the garden by the rope, and got the <b>medlars,</b> and was just making the rope fast under her arms so as to be hauled up, when her sister cried: 'Oh, there are such delicious lemons a little farther on. You might bring me one or two.' Maria turned round to pluck them, and found herself {{face to face with the}} gardener, who caught hold of her, exclaiming, 'What are you doing here, you little thief?' 'Don't call me names,' she said, 'or you will get the worst of it,' giving him as she spoke such a violent push that he fell panting into the lemon bushes. Then she seized the cord and clambered up to the window.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{however, the}} {{national}} taste has changed; {{the supply of}} Madeira not sufficing for the demand, the class called boticarios (apothecaries) brought rivals into the market; and extensive imitation's with apples, loquats (Japanese <b>medlars),</b> and other frauds, brandied to make the stuff keep, plastered or doctored with Paris-plaster to correct over-acidity, and coloured and sweetened with burnt sugar and with boiled 'must' (mosto) to mock the Madeira flavour, gave the island-produce a bad name. Again, the revolution in the wine-trade of 1860-61 brought with it certain Continental ideas. In France a glass of Madeira follows soup, and in Austria it is drunk in liqueur-glasses like Tokay.|$|E

60|$|You have {{probably}} {{come to see}} that market because you have read in your guide-books that the region round about Ronda {{is one of the}} richest in Spain for grapes and peaches and <b>medlars</b> and melons and other fruits whose names melt in the mouth. If you do not find in the market the abundance you expect of its picturesqueness you must blame the lateness of the season, and go visit the bull-ring, {{one of the most famous}} in the world, for Ronda is not less noted for its toreros and aficionados than for its vineyards and orchards. But here again the season will have been before you with the glory of those corridas which you have still hoped not to witness but to turn from as an example to the natives before the first horse is disemboweled or the first bull slain, or even the first banderillero tossed over the barrier.|$|E
60|$|That {{might have}} been because it was near the market where we {{experienced}} almost the only mercantile zeal we had known in Spain. Women with ropes and garlands of onions round their necks invited us to buy, and we had hopeful advances from the stalls of salads and fruits, {{where there was a}} brave and beautiful show of lettuces and endives, grapes, <b>medlars,</b> and heaps of melons, but no oranges; I do not know why, though there were shining masses of red peppers and green, peppers, and vast earthen bowls with yellow peas soaking in them. The flowers were every gay autumnal sort, especially dahlias, sometimes made into stiff bouquets, perhaps for church offerings. There were mounds of chestnuts, four or five feet high and wide; and these flowers and fruits filled the interior of the market, while the stalls for the flesh and fish were on the outside. There seemed more sellers than buyers; here and there were ladies buying, but it is said that the mistresses commonly send their maids for the daily provision.|$|E

50|$|Court records {{reveal that}} <b>Medlar</b> had {{received}} a total of $250,000 from Cisneros between 1988 and 1992, prior to his cabinet appointment.

The television broadcast of transcripts of the taped conversations, {{as well as a}} televised Inside Edition interview in which <b>Medlar</b> charged Secretary Cisneros with lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompted U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to call for an independent investigation. As a result of the investigation, a Washington, D.C. grand jury handed down a 21 count indictment on December 11, 1997. In the 66 page indictment entitled the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. HENRY G.

The present study {{outlines}} that the native <b>medlar</b> (Mespilus germanica L.) fruits an extremely rich source of antioxidants. In this study, antioxidant and antiradical property of <b>medlar</b> fruits were evaluated. Total phenolics and flavonoids amounts in lyophilized extract of <b>medlar</b> (LEM) fruits were calculated as gallic acid and quercetin equivalents, respectively. Antioxidant and radical scavenging activity of LEM were investigated using different in vitro assays including 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH∙), N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD •+), and superoxide anion radicals (O 2 •-) scavenging activity, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), ferric ions (Fe 3 +) and cupric ions (Cu 2 +) reducing ability, Fe 3 +-TPTZ reducing ability, ferrous ions (Fe 2 +) chelating activity as trolox equivalent. In addition, quantitative amounts of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin, α-tocopherol, pyrogallol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid and ascorbic acid in LEM were detected by high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
