40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the rock {{breaking}} ability of jet nozzle in radial drilling technique, pulsed cavitating <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle</b> was designed {{on the basis of}} <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle.</b> And its modulation mechanism of pulsed cavitating jet was analyzed. Rock breaking test was carried out to compare the rock breaking results of pulsed cavitating <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle</b> and <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The results indicated that the rock breaking result of pulsed cavitating <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle</b> is better than that of <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The rock breaking volume is 1. 23 ∼ 2. 35 times. To guarantee the minimum hole diameter is bigger than nozzle diameter, jet impact pressure should not be lower than 30 MPa in the experiment. The experimental optimal standoff distance is 12 mm. The findings in this paper can increase the extension of horizontal holes and improve drilling rate in radial drilling technique...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Physics of fluids and is also available at: [URL] cavitation has been studied in an optical automotive size fuel injector with true-scale flow geometry at injection pressures of up to 2050 bar. The <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry studied allowed observation of the hole-to-hole vortex interaction and, in particular, that of a bridging vortex in the sac region between the holes. A dependency on Reynolds number was observed {{in the formation of the}} visible, vapor filled vortex cores. Above a threshold Reynolds number, their formation and appearance during a 2 ms injection event was repeatable and independent of upstream pressure and cavitation number...|$|E
40|$|A unified {{approach}} toward modeling fuel sprays for internal combustion engines {{is presented in}} this work. The fuel injection process has been divided in three subprocesses, namely, primary atomization, drop deformation and aerodynamic drag, and secondary atomization. Two different models {{have been used for}} the primary atomization, depending on whether a high-pressure swirl atomizer or a <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzle</b> is used. The drop deformation and secondary atomization have been modeled based on the physical properties of the system, independent of the way the droplets were created. The secondary atomization has been further divided into four breakup regimes, based on experimental observations reported in the literature. The model has been validated using a wide array of experimental conditions, ranging from gasoline to diesel sprays, in nonevaporating conditions. Overall, the model performs well, predicting correct trends for the spray characteristics, without the need for recalibration. Copyright © 2008 Begell House, Inc...|$|E
40|$|A vast {{majority}} of the medium and high speed Diesel engines are equipped with multi-hole injection nozzles nowadays. Inaccuracies in workmanship and changing hydraulic conditions in the nozzles result in differences in injection rates between individual injection nozzle holes. The new deformational measuring method described in the paper allows injection rate measurement in each injection nozzle hole. The differences in injection rates lead to uneven thermal loads of Diesel engine combustion chambers. All today known measuring method, such as Bosch and Zeuch give accurate results of the injection rate in diesel single-hole <b>nozzles.</b> With <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzles</b> they tellus nothing about possible differences in injection rates between individual holes of the nozzle. At deformational measuring method, the criterion of the injected fuel is expressed by the deformation of membrane occurring due to the collision of the pressure wave against the membrane. The pressure wave is generated by the injection of the fuel into the measuring space. For each hole of the nozzle the measuring device must have a measuring space of its own into which fuel is injected as well as its measuring membraneand its own fuel outlet. During measurements procedure the measuring space must be filled with fuel to maintain an overpressure of 5 kPa. Fuel escaping from the measuring device is conducted into the graduated cylinders for measuring the volumetric flow through each hole of the nozzle. The membrane deformation is assessed by strain gauges. They are glued to the membrane and forming the full Wheatstonećs bridge. We devoted special attention to the membrane shape and temperature compensation of the strain gauges...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work undertaken at the University of Brighton on a rapid compression machine {{based on}} a two-stroke diesel engine (Proteus) with an optical head to allow observation of the fuel spray. A long-tube, rate of injection rig {{was used to measure}} the injection rate of the fuel injection system. Quantification of cyclic variation and rate of injection were carried out for single and multiple-injection strategy. For multiple-injections, {{it was found that the}} injected mass of the first of the split was approximately 19 % less than that of the single injection strategy for the same injection duration. The second split reduction was less than 4 % in comparison to the single injection strategy. The transient response of the fuel injection equipment was characterised and compared with steady-state behaviour. The characteristics of the Proteus rig in terms of trapped air mass and transient incylinder temperature were investigated and quantified. The effect of in-cylinder temperature, density and pressure, as well as injection pressure on the characteristics of spray formation, for single and multi-hole nozzles were investigated using high speed video cameras. Cycle-to-cycle and hole-to-hole variations for multi-hole nozzles were investigated and attributed to uneven fuel pressure distribution round the needle seat, and subsequent cavitation phenomena. Simultaneous Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Mie scattering techniques were used to investigate spray formation and vapour propagation for <b>multihole</b> <b>nozzles</b> for single and multiple-injection strategy. The multiple injection work focused on the effect of dwell period between each injection. Two different modes of flow were identified. These are described as 'wake impingement' and 'cavity mode wake effect', resulting in increased tip velocity of the second split spray. The increase in tip velocity depended on dwell period and distance downstream of the nozzle exit. The maximum increase was calculated at 17 m/s. A spray pattern growth for the second of the split injections, the 'exceed type' was identified, resulting from an increase in tip penetration due to air entrainment of the first split and propagation into the cooler vapour phase from the first split. The effect of liquid core length near the nozzle exit was investigated using modified empirical correlations and the evolution of the discharge coefficient obtained from rate of injection measurements. The results showed increased injection pressure and increased in-cylinder gas pressure reduce both break-up length and break-up time. Penetration was modelled using conservation of mass and momentum of the injected fuel mass. The input to the numerical model was the measured transient rate of injection. The model traced the centre-of-mass of the spray and was validated against PLIF data for centre-of-mass. Overall, the same value of modelling parameters gave good agreement for single and split injection strategy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
