A study {{has been made of}} indirect methods for arsenic and silicon based on molybdenum heteropoly acid chemistry with the final measurement by atomic absorption spectrometry. The optimum conditions for the formation and solvent extraction of the neteropoly acids were chosen to minimize the blank levels. Procedures have been developed for the determination of silicon and arsenic. Silicon is extracted as 12 -molybdosilicic acid into a mixture of diethyl ether and pentan-l-ol (5 + 1). The coextraction of excess molybdate reagent is prevented by the addition of citrate which also destroys <b>molybdophosphoric</b> and molybdoarsenic acids. The organic layer is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and determinations are made by using solution spectrophotometry and carbon rod electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The method has been applied to the analysis of several British Chemical standard steels. Arsenic is extracted as 12 -molybdoarsenic acid into a mixture of diethyl ether and pentan-l-ol(3 + 1). The interferences from other heteropoly forming elements could not be suppressed by the addition of masking agents.

The MoP-CTAB compound could be efficiently extracted on an in-line Sep-Pak C 18 cartridge, and rapidly eluted by 0. 3 mol l(- 1) sulphuric acid-ethanol solution. Then the compound was reduced by luminol to produce chemiluminescence light, which could be detected using a luminescence analyzer. Experimental parameters were optimized using a univariate experimental design. Using artificial seawater with salinity of 35 as a matrix, the standard curve with a linear range between 0. 005 and 0. 194 mu mol l(- 1) had been obtained, and the recovery and the detection limit of the proposed method {{were found to be}} 92. 5 % and 0. 002 mu mol l(- 1), respectively.

For the sulfided Mo-O catalyst containing no nickel as promoter, the only hydrogen sulfide evolution peak I is observed at 462 K and attributed to the hydrogenation of the so-called edge sulfur atoms chemisorbed on coordinatively unsaturated(cus) Mox+ sites on the MoS 2 phase(MoS 2 slab). With the introduction of nickel into the active phase of the sulfided Mo-O catalyst and {{with the increase of}} the molybdenum loading, a new hydrogen sulfide evolution peak II gradually develops at the low temperature side of;he peak I, at the same time accompanied by both the increase of the area ratio of the peak II to the peak I and the shift of the hydrogen sulfide evolution maximum rate to lower temperatures, which may imply the existence of two kinds of active centers related to molybdenum and nickel respectively and the synergic action between the two centers above. It should be noted that for the sulfided NiMoP/gamma -Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the thiophene HDS rate and the quantity of hydrogen sulfide evolved during TPR process increase monotonously with the atomic ratio of molybdenum to nickel in the form of [n(Ni) +n(Mo) ]/n(Ni). On the basis of the results here, the conclusion may be reached that the two kinds of vacancies can be formed on the edge of Ni-Mo-S slab due to the loss of S during TPR process and vacancies or sites related to the H 2 S evolution peak II should be regarded as the mainly active reaction centers of thiophene I-IDS...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of two separate and unrelated projects. The first project examines the preparation of functional groups that can serve as immobilized bases in molecular sieves. Many heterogeneous, base catalysts {{are not able to}} promote diverse reaction types that require strong bases as catalysts. Additionally, some of the stronger solid base catalysts are sensitive to carbon dioxide and moisture in air and therefore are not easily suitable for recycling. Organic-functionalized molecular sieves possess an organic moiety within the pore space of a molecular sieve by incorporation of an organosilane directly into the synthesis gel of the molecular sieve. Previous work reported by Davis and co-workers demonstrated the incorporation of an acid site in zeolite Beta (*BEA type) and its use in shape-selective acid catalysis. Here, a phosphonium functionality is prepared from halogen-containing alkyl groups in *BEA to allow the incorporation of a strong base (OH-) within the molecular sieve for base catalysis. Characterization of the phosphonium-containing material prepared is accomplished. Shape-selective chemical reactions and ion-exchanges are presented, and the results of these experiments suggest that the functional groups are located within the molecular sieve pore space, although the exact structure of these moieties is not conclusively obtained. The second part of this thesis examines the use of niobium- and pyridine-exchanged heteropolyanions as catalyst precursors for the selective oxidation of light alkanes with dioxygen. The versatility of many oxidation catalysts is limited, thereby restricting potential usefulness. Alkenes, typically used as feedstock, are becoming costly as their demand for use in many other industrial processes increases. The use of light alkanes as reactants for selective oxidation would allow one to take advantage of an under-utilized and relatively inexpensive feedstock for selective oxidation. Niobium- and pyridine-exchanged heteropolyanions (HPAs) have been shown to produce highly active and selective catalysts for the oxidation of propane and n-butane to acrylic acid and maleic acid, respectively, by Davis and co-workers. Specifically, <b>molybdophosphoric</b> acid and molybdovanadophosphoric acid were exchanged with niobium oxalate and pyridine to produce the exchanged HPAs (denoted NbPMo 12 pyr and NbPMo 11 Vpyr, respectively). Preliminary work in these studies indicates that the exchanged HPAs may also be effective for the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid. The application of this catalyst system to the selective oxidation of ethane to acetic acid and ethylene is explored here. The exchanged heteropolyanions give higher ethane conversion at elevated pressures (230 psig and 280 oC) but better yields at atmospheric pressure and 380 oC. Variations of steam flow rates or reaction temperatures are not observed to improve acetic acid space-time-yield (STY). Lower gas-hourly-space-velocity (GHSV) causes the ethylene and acetic acid to over-oxidize to COx. The maximum STY of acetic acid using NbPMo 12 pyr is 0. 021 mmol/min/g catalyst at 380 oC, 0 psig, and flows of 16 : 8 : 16 : 20 mL/min of ethane: oxygen: helium: steam. At elevated pressure (230 psig) the addition of vanadium into the Keggin ion precursor is shown to decrease conversion (from 6. 0...|$|E
