Wodehouse wrote in 1957, [...] "If you ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess that I do not.... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing {{to show for it}} but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897." [...] The first name was rapidly elided to [...] "Plum", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

In the next press conference, he said, [...] "It’s great to be in Victory Lane but we’ve got {{to keep it in}} {{perspective}} that this wasn’t the Daytona 500. You want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what’s going to happen on Sunday? We’re going to have 400 miles of some stuff happening, but then 100 miles of a lot of things happening. We’re going to have six or seven cautions in the last 100 laps, it’s going to be a short race to [...] chequered [...] and that’s what’s going to happen." [...] The second event took one hour, five minutes and 54 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.005 seconds. A crowd of 80,000 people attended the races. The races had a television audience of 3.303 million people.|$|E

500|$|Prompted by the government, the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation {{told the}} public to stand by for an {{important}} announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become [...] "abundantly {{clear that it is}} the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept... I promised {{the people of this country}} that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that negotiations have come to an end".|$|E

[...] Young, who was a devout Catholic, advanced towards her waving an empty coffee can, saying, [...] "Come on Ethel. You know my rules. That'll cost you a dollar." [...] To which Merman replied [...] "Ah, honey, how much will it cost <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to go fuck yourself?!".|$|E

Nelson was pleased with Ferrier's services during this time, mentioning him in a letter to Earl St Vincent, [...] "Captain Ferrier you do not know, therefore it becomes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> that his ship is in the very first order, and that {{he is a man of}} sense, and as steady as old Time himself; I am much pleased with his regularity and punctuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested {{there might have been a}} mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and {{my job is to}} enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress {{you want to}} get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and {{approximately}} {{one hundred thousand}} Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing [...] "a haze of ganja smoke" [...] to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport {{but was unable to}} come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: [...] "The Emperor has instructed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.|$|E
