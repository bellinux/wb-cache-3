40|$|Background: According to {{clinical}} experience, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbs added to platinum-based therapy (PBT) improve the Quality of Life (QOL) in metastatic {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients, but {{this must be}} prospectively validated. Patients and Methods: Based on clinical impressions regarding the effect of adding TCM herbs to platinum-based chemotherapy, we anticipated that 2 × 21 patients would be sufficient to obtain significant results with an α 0. 10). The only side effects attributed by some of the patients to the TCM herbs were transient, mild gastric/abdominal heaviness in the first 2 weeks, but these also occurred amongst the PBT+PLACEBO patients (17 and 13 %, P > 0. 10). The incidence rates of nausea during treatment were 17 % in PBT+TCM versus 75 % in PBT+PLACEBO; vomiting rates were 14 and 56 % (P < 0. 0001 and 0. 002). Moreover, ECOG “improved and stable rates” were 90 % in the PBT+TCM versus 69 % in the PBT+PLACEBO group (P = 0. 04). In PBT+TCM patients, FACT-L social/familial and functional subscales were better after 2 months’ treatment (P = 0. 02 and 0. 03).

40|$|Sacha I Rothschild Department of Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland Abstract: Rearrangements in ALK {{gene and}} EML 4 gene were first {{described}} in 2007. This genomic aberration {{is found in}} about 2 %– 8 % of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Crizotinib was the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor licensed {{for the treatment of}} <b>metastatic</b> ALK-positive <b>NSCLC</b> based on a randomized Phase III trial. Despite the initial treatment response of crizotinib, disease progression inevitably develops after approximately 10 months of therapy. Different resistance mechanisms have recently been described. One relevant mechanism of resistance is the development of mutations in ALK. Novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to overcome these mutations. Ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK inhibitor showing clinical activity not only in crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC but also in treatment-naïve ALK-positive disease. In this paper, preclinical and clinical data of ceritinib are reviewed, and its role in the clinical setting is put into perspective. Keywords: lung cancer, ALK, ceritinib, crizotini...|$|R

Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess miR- 761 expression in NSCLC serum and tissue. MTT, wound healing, and transwell assays were performed to examine the role of miR- 761 in regulation of cell proliferation and <b>metastatic</b> activity in <b>NSCLC</b> cell lines. In addition, the correlations of miR- 761 expression with clinical-pathologic factors were statistically analyzed. Finally, we investigated whether miR- 761 promotes proliferation and metastasis in NSCLC cell lines by targeting ING 4 (inhibitor of growth family, member 4) and TIMP 2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2). Results: MiR- 761 was significantly upregulated in both NSCLC serum and tissues as compared to normal participants and paired noncancerous tissues respectively. Ectopic expression of miR- 761 promoted cell proliferation and metastasis in H 460 cells, while miR- 761 inhibitor reduced proliferation rates and metastasis in H 23 cells. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay and functional analyses indicated that miR- 761 directly targeted ING 4 and TIMP 2.

Unfortunately, {{it is not uncommon}} to observe toxic side-effects with lack of efficacy. Aim of our study was to analyse clinical factors potentially influencing the global outcome of advanced NSCLC patients receiving third-line therapy. Patients with histologically proven inoperable (IIIB) or <b>metastatic</b> (IV) <b>NSCLC,</b> who received a second- and third-line treatment (either with EGFR-TKIs or chemotherapy), were eligible for our analysis. 143 patients received a second-line treatment after failing a first line cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 52 patients from this series were offered a third-line treatment. In the third-line setting, a better overall survival (months) was related to sex and to response to second-line. Globally, our findings seem to indicate that an improved overall survival in third-line is more strictly dependent on response to second-line, thus suggesting that when planning a third-line treatment, response to second-line should be considered as a relevant factor for the decision making process.

40|$|Working Paper GATE 2009 - 03 Context: The {{significant}} survival {{benefit of}} chemotherapy over {{best supportive care}} for locally advanced and <b>metastatic</b> <b>NSCLC</b> has been amply demonstrated in the literature. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence {{of the impact of the}} type of chemotherapy or of a superiority of combination chemotherapy over single-agent chemotherapy. Objective: The present study empirically examines, in real-life practise and using multiple proxies, the impact of health care expenditures on overall survival in locally advanced and <b>metastatic</b> <b>NSCLC</b> in order to guide medical decision-making. Methods: Disease characteristics, the resources used, the costs of treatment and survival data were retrospectively collected from the records of 175 patients treated between 2000 and 2004 at Léon Bérard Regional Cancer Center (Lyon, France). Survival data were modelled using multivariate Cox models and controlled for endogeneity with the instrumental variable method. Results: The median survival for the whole cohort was 289 days. The average total cost of treatment reached € 35, 160. Survival was significantly shorter for patients with stage IV disease, poor performance status, and past or concomitant cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes, for current smokers, and for patients with adenocarcinoma compared to large cell carcinoma. Survival duration was not significantly associated with the total cost of treatment per day of hospitalisation, the number of chemotherapy drugs administered, nor inpatient length of stay.

However, the role of TR 4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient prognosis and the development of NSCLC cancer cells are unclear. MethodsImmunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between TR 4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in 291 cases of NSCLC specimens. A knockdown and over{{expression of}} TR 4 was performed to assess the role of TR 4. Transwell and colony formation assays were completed to investigate the metastatic and proliferative abilities. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were carried out to analyze the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. ResultsImmunohistochemical evaluation of clinical samples revealed that most of the lung cancer tissues were strongly positive for TR 4, whereas the tissues that stained weakly positive or negative for TR 4 expression were shown in the paired normal tissues. Moreover, higher levels of TR 4 expression were significantly associated with higher lymph node metastases, TNM stages, tumor thrombus in vena and poor prognosis. We observed that downregulation and up-regulation of TR 4 with stable cell transfection significantly influence the proliferation, invasive and <b>metastatic</b> abilities of <b>NSCLC</b> lines. In addition, aberrant TR 4 expression could modulate the expression levels of several EMT related markers. ConclusionsCollectively, our results show TR 4 expression in NSCLC samples is significantly associated with poor clinicopathological features, and TR 4 {{plays an important role in}} the <b>metastatic</b> capacity of <b>NSCLC</b> cells by EMT regulation...|$|R

Determination of SH-and SS-groups in hemoly-sate was done by spectrophotometry. In processing th...|$|R

Ligation of these receptors can lead to T cell anergy or exhaustion, resulting in {{the inability of the}} immune system to kill cancer cells. Inhibition of the blocking responses to T cell activation using anti-PDCD 1, anti-CTLA 4, or anti-CD 274 antibodies has proven clinically to result in improved responses for a subset of patients with <b>metastatic</b> melanoma, <b>NSCLC,</b> and potentially other forms of cancer (Achkar and Tarhini, 2017; Kim et al., 2017). Additionally, efforts are ongoing to use combinations of anti-PD 1 and anti-CTLA 4 antibodies to increase the percentage of patients experiencing durable responses, i.e., “raising the tail of the survival curve” (Harris et al., 2016). Alternatively, several clinical candidates are agonists of T-cell activating receptors such as TNFRSF 4 (OX 40), CD 40, TNFRSF 9 (CD 137, 4 - 1 BB), TNFRSF 18 (GITR), ICOS (CD 278), CD 27, or CD 28 to stimulate T cell responses (Antonia et al., 2016; Table  10).|$|R
30|$|This was {{the first}} {{prospective}} study to examine the efficacy of docetaxel in combination with selumetinib, a MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor, in patients with pre-treated KRAS mutant Stage III-IV NSCLC Overall survival did not significantly improve however there were statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival and response rate. One major drawback {{of the study was}} the study size. Although more than 300 patients were screened for the study, only 87 were included in the study. The success of these drugs in combination was at the cost of adverse events including febrile neutropenia, pneumonia and neutropenia. Currently an ongoing phase III trial with mandated growth factor support is underway assessing the efficacy and safety of selumetinib and docetaxel in advanced or <b>metastatic</b> KRAS mutant <b>NSCLC</b> in the second line and beyond (NCT 01933932).|$|R
