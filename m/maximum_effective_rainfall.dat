40|$|Abstract: The {{major source}} of water {{available}} either for agriculture or for human consumption is obtained from the rain that falls on the earth's surface. Agricultural production in Bangladesh is very much dependent upon rainfall. But, not all the rain that falls on the earth's surface is useful for agricultural purpose. This study deals with "effective rainfall", i. e. the rainfall that directly satisfies crop water requirements. In this study four different methods {{have been used for}} estimating <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> in Bangladesh. <b>Effective</b> <b>rainfalls</b> have been estimated for the ten meteorological stations of Bangladesh, covering South- Eastern part of the country. By using different climatological data, <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> have been estimated for two crop growing seasons, one is Kharif (July to October) and the other is Rabi (December to March). It has been observed that the values of <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> percentage for Kharif season varies from 13. 94 % at Teknaf to 47. 27 % at Chandpur by Renfro Equation Method, from 18. 79 % at Teknaf to 46. 33 % at Chandpur by U. S.

40|$|Pore water pressure, {{build up}} by {{recharge}} of hydrosystems, {{is one of}} the main triggering factors of deep seated landslides. <b>Effective</b> <b>rainfall,</b> which is the part of the rainfall which recharges the aquifer, is a significant parameter. Soil-water balance is an accurate way to estimate <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall.</b> Nevertheless this approach requires evapotranspiration, soil water storage and runoff characterization. Available soil storage and runoff were deduced from field observations whereas evapotranspiration computation is a highly demanding method requiring significant input of meteorological data. Most of the landslide sites used weather stations with limited datasets. A workflow method was developed to compute <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> requiring only temperature and rainfall as inputs. Two solar radiation and five commonly used evapotranspiration equations were tested at Séchilienne.

This paper discusses {{the findings of a}} calibration and cross-validation process using TOPMODEL to simulate stream discharge from the semi-arid Banqiao sub-catchment located in Gansu Province, China. Rainfall was preprocessed using two different methods and compared against the use of mean rainfall data from 10 gauging stations. The results indicate that correlating multiple rainfall gauge measurements against stream discharge and weighting the rainfall gauges according to correlation factors can be a useful means of obtaining more representative rainfall input. The second method used a transfer function model (TFM) equipped with a non-linear rainfall filter function to generate <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall.</b> The TFM was calibrated repeatedly using different degrees of non-linearity in the rainfall filter function until an optimal model was found. The <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> used to generate the best TFM was applied in TOPMODEL.

Although the R- 2 validation efficiencies or 'goodness of fit' generally lagged those seen during calibration, 90 % of TOPMODEL validation runs using TFM <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> and 60 % of those using correlation-weighted rainfall exceeded runs using mean rainfall.

By considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Quaternary aquifers in the Southern sector of the Lake Chad basin, this study has permitted to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the groundwater resources available in a selected area of about 2 9 3 4000 km. The estimated regulating reserve ranges between 0. 1 to 0. 5 x 10 m /year. Monthly and yearly estimation of the water budget, for a period of 16 years, according to the Thornthwaite-Mather method, shows that the main source of regulating reserve is the August rain. For a dry water year (like 1984), there is no <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall,</b> while in a year with a favourable rainfall, for example, we could have <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> ranging between 10 and 15 % that could improve the groundwater recharge.

40|$|A parametrically parsimonious, data-based {{model was}} built on {{observations}} at hillslope and catchment scale to simulate the distribution of overland flow within a small East African Highlands catchment (Kwalei, Tanzania). A rainfall-flow Data Based Mechanistic model identified catchment <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> and separated the discharge quick flow, interpreted as the combination of overland flow plus reinfiltration along the slopes, and the slow flow, interpreted as ground water displacement. Observations of overland flow occurrence along the slopes were used to derive probability distribution functions (pdfs) of overland flow in relation to <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> for two pre-defined hydrologic response units (HRUs) : perennial (HRU_ 1) versus other crops (HRU_ 2). At low <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall,</b> overland flow was more frequent in HRU_ 2, while at high <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> overland flow in the two HRUs was similar. The pdfs were employed to disaggregate the quick flow into HRU overland flow depth. Reinfiltration was accounted for by assuming that only the overland flow generated in {{the lower part of}} the field would drain downslope. Effective reinfiltration length was about 4 m. Comparison of model simulations versus Gerlach trough measurements indicated that rainfall intensity was not accounted for sufficiently. The use of smaller time steps or, alternatively, of a rainfall intensity threshold could improve model performance. However, given the high variability of overland flow observed along the slopes and the limited dataset, model simulations were considered satisfactory. Though the model needs further testing on other datasets, the disaggregating approach represents an inductive alternative to the use of infiltration equations to model overland flow within a catchment...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} and phenomenological {{aspects of}} the runoff process observed on different scales of aggregation are taken as a priori information for the conceptually based stochastic modeling of seasonal runoff. Runoff is considered as the sum of two groundwater components, with over-year and subannual response lag, and of a purely random component representing the direct runoff. This scheme is equivalent to a linear system, with two parallel linear reservoirs plus a zero lag linear channel. The system output is the runoff, and the input is the <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall,</b> considered proportional to the direct runoff. Assuming the <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> as a non-Gaussian periodic independent process and considering nonseasonal groundwater parameters, this conceptualization leads to an autoregressive and moving average (2, 2) stochastic process with periodic independent residual. Stochastic model parameters {{are directly related to}} the linear system coefficients, and the <b>effective</b> <b>rainfall</b> structure can be determined from the estimated model residual. In order to obtain parameter estimates consistent with the conceptual constraints, two estimation stages, on an annual and a seasonal basis, and an iterative procedure are needed.
