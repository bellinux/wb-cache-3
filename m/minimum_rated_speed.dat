The airplane, {{powered by a}} 600 - horse-power Pratt Whitney radial engine, was sized to carry a useful load of 2650 pounds. Unique features include interchangeable wings and a 55 - cubic-foot payload hopper designed {{as an integral part}} of the fuselage structure: Airplane performance and stability characteristics were estab-lished using both empirical and theoretical methods.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Department of the Navy, an {{investigation}} of the Westinghouse XJ 34 -WE- 32 turbojet engine is being conducted in the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel to determine the steady-state and transient operating characteristics of the controlled and uncontrolled engine at various altitudes and ram pressure ratios. As part of this program, transient performance data that illustrate the operation of the engine is obtained in the form of oscillographic traces. Similar data for engine operation i n the afterburning range, covering a range of throttle settings from the <b>minimum</b> value giving <b>rated</b> <b>speed</b> (throttle position, 72 degrees) to full afterburning (throttle position, ll 0 degrees), is presented herein. These data thus serve to indicate the transient characteristics of the engine when the throttle is advance into, withdrawn from, and moved within the afterburning range in a stepwise manner, as well as the steady-state stability of the engine during afterburning...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the design and}} construction of an experiment to establish the relative performance characteristics of sailboat bailing devices. Data was obtained {{for a series of}} production bailers, newly designed prototypes and production bailer variations allowing classification of their relative performance with regard to flow <b>rate,</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>speed</b> of bailing inception and drag. These results were non-dimensionalized and this information used {{to examine the effects of}} bailer geometry on performance in these critical categories. The experimental data conclusively show that a prototype developed from the current generation of production bailers produces in excess of three times the flow rate of the parent production bailer and is capable of operation at a significantly lower speeds. This bailer has an acceptable increase in measured drag over the production bailer baseline. A theory is advanced as to the reasons for these dramatic improvements in performance and this corroborated with visual observations of the bailer in operation. A study of operational considerations is also incorporated and these observations used in defining design requirements for a production version of the best prototype. A propose...|$|R

40|$|For fading {{broadcast}} channels, different capacity regions {{such as the}} ergodic, outage, <b>minimum</b> <b>rate,</b> or limited-jitter capacity region can {{be represented}} by a triplet of rate constraint parameters from each user: a maximum <b>rate,</b> a <b>minimum</b> <b>rate,</b> and a shortage probability over which the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> needs not be guaranteed. For each fading state, the capacity region is obtained by evaluating a finite set of possible extreme points. The optimal power allocation strategy across fading states {{is determined by the}} power requirements associated with the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>rates,</b> combined with water-filling for the excess power when the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> constraints are not tight. Shortage capacity can be obtained by optimizing the power allocation over the shortage fading states, when the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> constraints are removed, and the non-shortage fading states. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a scalable maxmin flow control protocol which guarantees the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> for each connection-oriented flow without requiring per-flow information. The protocol is called MR-ASAP (<b>Minimum</b> <b>Rate</b> guaranteeing Adaptive Source-link Accounting Protocol). MR-ASAP {{is an extension}} of ASAP [Tsa 98 a, Kim 99], the first exact maxmin flow control protocol for best-effort connection-oriented traffic in integrated service networks, without requiring per-flow accounting at the intermediate network node. In the classical maxmin computation, only the maximum rate constraints are considered; in this pa-per the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> requirements are treated similarly as the maximum rate constraints. Existing proto-cols that achieve exact maxmin optimality with <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee require per-flow information and complex computation such as sorting of the <b>minimum</b> <b>rates</b> at the switch. By generalizing the concept of constraint, the complex sorting and per-flow accounting required in the existing protocols are avoided. Simulation demonstrates fast convergence to optimality. The convergence of MR-ASAP is also proved analytically. Key words: Generalized maxmin, flow control, and <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee. 1...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, it is {{believed}} that using biomass has more advantages and benefits than using fossil fuels and oils. So, it should be kept in mind that studies around this subject could have impressive effects on the life of humans and even the planet in the future. This thesis describes the effect of impeller types on hydrodynamics and concentration distribution of composite wood pellets suspended in water in a stirred reactor. These effects are studied by conducting several experiments in order to examine three types of impellers; six-bladed Rushton turbine impeller, six-bladed pitched blade impeller and helical screw impeller. Then by measuring torque and impeller speeds, which were followed by estimation of power consumption and energy dissipation rates, the results were analysed and evaluated to figure out the most suitable and beneficial type of impeller, which can be used in industries. At the end of this research, {{it was found that the}} most suitable impeller for this study would be evaluated by parameters such as: power consumption, energy dissipation <b>rates,</b> <b>minimum</b> impeller <b>speed</b> and viscosity...|$|R

The optimal power allocation scheme is a two-step process: We first allocate the minimum power required to achieve the <b>minimum</b> <b>rates</b> in all fading states, and we then optimally allocate the excess power to maximize the ergodic rates averaged over all fading states {{in excess of the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> requirements.

40|$|Annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> {{of return}} {{guarantees}} are analyzed together with rules for distribution of positive excess return, i. e. investment returns {{in excess of}} the guaranteed minimum return. Together with the level of the annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee both the customer's and the insurer's fractions of the positive excess return are determined so that the market value of the insurer's capital inflow (determined by the fraction of the positive excess return) equals the market value of the insurer's capital outflow (determined by the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee) at the inception of the contract. The analysis is undertaken both with and without a surplus distribution mechanism. The surplus distribution mechanism works through a bonus account that serves as a buffer in the following sense: in ("bad") years when the investment returns are lower than the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee, funds are transferred from the bonus account to the customer's account. In ("good") years when the investment returns are above the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee, a part of the positive excess return is credited to the bonus account. In addition to characterizations of fair combinations of the level of the annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee and the sharing rules of the positive excess return, our analysis indicates that the presence of a surplus distribution mechanism allows the insurer to offer a much wider menu of contracts to the customer than without a surplus distribution mechanism...|$|R
