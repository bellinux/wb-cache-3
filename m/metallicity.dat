5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's <b>metallicity</b> is 0 (± 0.1), meaning {{that the level of}} iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that of}} the Sun. <b>Metallicity</b> plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher <b>metallicity</b> are more likely to have planets detected around them. This may be because the higher <b>metallicity</b> provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher <b>metallicity</b> increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E
5|$|Research in 1996 {{revealed}} that Sakurai's Object possessed {{the characteristics of}} a R Coronae Borealis variable star with the anomaly of Carbon-13 (13C) deficit. Also, the <b>metallicity</b> of Sakurai's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, it is expected that Sakurai's object will grow in its <b>metallicity</b> to match that of V605 Aquilae.|$|E
5|$|While high <b>metallicity</b> is {{beneficial}} {{for the creation}} of terrestrial extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess <b>metallicity</b> may lead to the formation {{of a large number of}} gas giants in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's frost line and become hot Jupiters, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone. Thus, it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to <b>metallicity</b> as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.|$|E
50|$|M106 {{has also}} played an {{important}} role in calibrating the cosmic distance ladder. Before, Cepheid variables from other galaxies cannot be used to measure distances since they cover ranges of <b>metallicities</b> different from the Milky Way's. M106 contains Cepheid variables similar to both of the <b>metallicities</b> of the Milky Way and other galaxies' Cepheids. By measuring the distance of the Cepheids with <b>metallicities</b> similar to our galaxy, astronomers are able to recalibrate the other Cepheids with different <b>metallicities,</b> a key fundamental step in improving the distances to other galaxies in the universe.|$|R

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the <b>metallicity.</b> These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower <b>metallicity.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal <b>metallicity.</b> The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of late K and M dwarf <b>metallicities</b> {{can be used}} {{to guide}} planet {{searches}} and constrain planet formation models. However, the determination of <b>metallicities</b> of late-type stars is difficult because visible wavelength spectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines, preventing the measurement of equivalent widths.

40|$|Abstract. A {{sample of}} subdwarfs with {{accurate}} space velocities and standarized <b>metallicities</b> is presented. This was constructed by combining Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions with radial velocities and <b>metallicities</b> from Carney et al. (1994; CLLA). The accurate Hipparcos parallaxes lead to an- upward- correction factor of 11 % of the photometric distance scale of CLLA. The kinematical behaviour of the subdwarfs {{is discussed in}} particular {{in relation to their}} <b>metallicities.</b> Most of the stars turn out to be thick disk stars, but the sample contains also many genuine halo stars. While the extreme metal poor halo does not rotate, a population of subdwarfs with <b>metallicities</b> in the range – 1. 6 < [Fe/H] < – 1. 0 dex appears to rotate around the galactic center with a mean rotation speed of about 100 km/s. 1.

40|$|Getting spectra at good {{signal-to-noise}} ratios takes {{orders of}} magnitudes {{more time than}} photometric observations. Building on the technique developed for photometric redshift estimation of galaxies, we develop and demonstrate a non-parametric photometric method for estimating the chemical composition of galactic stars.

The technique is generic {{in the sense that}} it is not restricted to certain stellar types or stellar parameter ranges and makes it possible to obtain <b>metallicities</b> and error estimates for a much larger sample than spectroscopic surveys would allow.

5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} <b>metallicity</b> {{of a star}} as the {{abundance}} of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual <b>metallicity</b> ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However {{the margin of error}} for this result is relatively large.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses Doppler spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of stars that hadn't been previously surveyed.

5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} <b>metallicity</b> of cool {{stars is}} {{difficult}} due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their <b>metallicity,</b> naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and <b>metallicity.</b> What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense.
