5|$|Amanda Carter (born 16 July 1964) is an Australian Paralympic {{wheelchair}} basketball player. Diagnosed with transverse <b>myelitis</b> {{at the age}} of 24, {{she began}} playing wheelchair basketball in 1991 and participated in the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, the Gliders, at three Paralympics from 1992 to 2000. An injury in 2000 forced her to withdraw from the sport, but she came back to the national team in 2009, and {{was a member of the}} team that represented Australia and won silver at the 2012 London Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|Carter {{was born}} on 16 July 1964 in Heidelberg, Victoria. She spent her {{childhood}} living in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg West. She went to Olympic Village Primary School, attended years 7 to 10 at Latrobe High School and years 11 and 12 at Thornbury High School. She then entered LaTrobe University, where she obtained Bachelor of Applied Science and Master of Occupational Therapy degrees. As a youngster, she played netball. In 1989, {{at the age of}} 24, she was diagnosed with transverse <b>myelitis</b> after a bout of chicken pox. She works as an occupational therapist and has a son, Alex. , she still lives in Heidelberg West.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 2016, Jordison {{revealed}} that he suffers from transverse <b>myelitis,</b> a neurological disease which temporarily cost him {{the use of his}} legs and caused him to be unable to play the drums before rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis {{may affect}} {{the central nervous system}} (meninges, brain or spinal cord) in which case it is called TB meningitis, TB cerebritis, and TB <b>myelitis</b> respectively; the {{standard}} treatment is 12 months of drugs (2HREZ/10HR) and steroid are mandatory.|$|E
25|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{also known}} as Devic's disease or Devic's syndrome, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (<b>myelitis).</b> It can be monophasic or recurrent.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{instances}} of optic neuritis and <b>myelitis</b> were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity. However, some patients had pathology {{in other parts}} of the brain, a feature which was more suggestive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or MS.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} both sides being silent and evasive as to the reasons for his leaving the band, Jordison {{revealed}} in June 2016 that he suffered from transverse <b>myelitis,</b> a neurological disease which cost him the ability to play the drums {{toward the end of}} his time with Slipknot.|$|E
25|$|Whether Devic's {{disease is}} a {{distinct}} disease {{or part of the}} wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. Devic's disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as transverse <b>myelitis,</b> and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} lesions occur occasionally. Cerebral granulomatous disease {{may be caused}} by S. japonicum eggs in the brain. Communities in China {{affected}} by S. japonicum have been found to have rates of seizures eight times higher than baseline. Similarly, granulomatous lesions from S. mansoni and S. haematobium eggs in the spinal cord can lead to transverse <b>myelitis</b> with flaccid paraplegia. Eggs are thought to travel to the central nervous system via embolization.|$|E
25|$|This ruling {{held that}} tetanus vaccine caused a {{particular}} case of optic neuritis even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim. Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the MMR vaccine causes fibromyalgia, that the Hib vaccine causes transverse <b>myelitis,</b> and that the hepatitis B vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multiple sclerosis. In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the Institute of Medicine that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, <b>myelitis,</b> and syphilis.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, {{and had no}} outward {{symptoms of}} any disorder {{for the first few}} years of his life.

The Merricks had two more children not three as stated on his mothers grave,John Thomas (born 21 April 1864 did indeed die of smallpox 24 July of the same year) but he was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane [...] Merrick. William Arthur (born January 1866) who died of scarlet fever on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870. William is buried with his Mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester. Marian Eliza (born 28 September 1867), who was born with physical disabilities and died of <b>myelitis</b> and [...] "seizures" [...] on 19 March 1891 aged 24. Marian is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester. When writing of in his book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, Ashley Montagu states that [...] " [...] Merrick was born on 21 April 1864". Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences that Merrick's first name was John, not Joseph, and confused him with his younger brother, a child which has now been proved was not related to Joseph Merrick.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "chronic fatigue syndrome" [...] {{has been}} criticized by {{patients}} as being both stigmatizing and trivializing, and which in turn prevents the illness from being seen as a serious health problem that deserves appropriate research. While many patients prefer [...] "myalgic encephalomyelitis", which they believe better reflects the medical nature of the illness, there is [...] resistance amongst clinicians toward the use of myalgic encephalomyelitis {{on the grounds that}} the inflammation of the central nervous system (<b>myelitis)</b> implied by the term has not been demonstrated.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{patients}} with monophasic Devic's disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs.

[...] In some patients (33% in one study), transverse <b>myelitis</b> in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. [...] However, the spectrum of Devic's disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.|$|E

Studies have shown respiratory tract infections within 4-39 days prior to the onset of transverse <b>myelitis.</b> Or, tuberculosis, syphilis, and brucellosis are also known to cause <b>myelitis</b> in immune-compromised individuals. <b>Myelitis</b> is a rare manifestation of bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|Most viral <b>myelitis</b> is acute, but the {{retrovirus}} (HIV, HTLV) {{can cause}} chronic <b>myelitis.</b> Poliomyelitis, or gray matter <b>myelitis,</b> is usually caused by infection of anterior horn of {{the spinal cord}} by the enteroviruses (polioviruses, enteroviruses (EV) 70 and 71, echoviruses, coxsackieviruses A and B) and the flaviviruses (West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis). On the other hand, transverse <b>myelitis</b> or leukomyelitis, or white matter <b>myelitis,</b> are often caused by the herpesviruses and influenza virus. It can be due to direct viral invasion or via immune mediated mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} reports {{describing the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} transverse <b>myelitis</b> were published in 1885 and 1910 by Bastian. Suchett-Kaye first coined the term transverse <b>myelitis</b> in 1948.|$|E

50|$|According to {{at least}} one source the {{incidence}} of transverse <b>myelitis</b> is 4.6 in 1 million, affecting men and women equally. Transverse <b>myelitis</b> can occur at any age (particularly around age 10, age 20, and after age 40).|$|E
50|$|Transverse <b>myelitis</b> is a {{neurological}} {{condition in which}} the spinal cord is inflamed.
