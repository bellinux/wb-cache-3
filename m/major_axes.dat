2500|$|The {{absorption}} and emission {{cross sections}} of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the <b>major</b> <b>axes</b> aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. [...] The random distribution of {{the orientation of the}} ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not.|$|E

2500|$|In 1598 the London {{historian}} John Stow {{admitted that}} [...] "The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory hereof, is none". However, his contemporary William Camden, in Britannia (1586), his historical description of Great Britain, {{concluded that it}} was a Roman milliarium, a central stone from which all distances in Roman Britain were measured, and similar to the Milliarium Aureum of Rome. This identification remains popular, although there is no archaeological evidence to support it. Camden's identification has been revived by John Michell in his book The Sacred Centre (2009), where he identifies the stone as the London terminus, a stone sacred to Jupiter that stood at the centre of every Roman city, and which parallels the golden milestone in the Forum in Rome. He believes it was at the intersection of the <b>major</b> <b>axes</b> of the Roman city, the north south Cardo Maximus and the east west Decumanus.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{orientation of}} clusters' <b>major</b> elongation <b>axes</b> and clusters' angular momentum is studied using a large N-body simulation {{in a box}} of 500 Mpc/h base length for a standard LambdaCDM model. Employing the technique of mark correlation functions, we successfully separated the correlations in the orientation from the well known clustering signal traced by the two-point correlation function. The correlations in the orientation are highly significant for our sample of 3000 clusters. We found an alignment of neighboring clusters, i. e. an enhanced probability of the <b>major</b> elongation <b>axes</b> of neighboring cluster pairs to be in parallel with each other. At 10 Mpc/h separation the amplitude of this signal is ~ 10 % above the value expected from random orientations, and it vanishes on scales larger than 15 Mpc/h. The ``filamentary'' alignment between clusters' <b>major</b> elongation <b>axes</b> and the lines pointing towards neighboring clusters shows even stronger deviations from random orientation, which can be detected out to scales of 100 Mpc/h, both in 2 D and 3 D analyses. Similarly, strong correlations of the angular momentum were seen. Also a clear signal in the scalar correlation of the absolute value of the angular momentum, the spin parameter and the mass was found. They extend up to 50 Mpc/h and have an amplitude of 40 %, 15 %, and 10 % above a random distribution at 10 Mpc/h separation, respectively.
