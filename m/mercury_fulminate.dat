Along {{the southern part of}} the river is the neighborhood of Almaden Valley, originally named for the mercury mines which produced mercury needed for gold extraction from quartz during the California Gold Rush as well as <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> blasting caps and detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945. East of the Guadalupe River, Coyote Creek also flows to south San Francisco Bay and originates on Mount Sizer near Henry W.

2500|$|The Maynard tape primer is {{a system}} {{designed}} to allow for more rapid reloading of muskets which previously relied on small copped caps that were filled with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> Dr. Edward Maynard, a dentist {{with an interest in}} firearms, embedded tiny pellets of priming material in thin strips of paper, then glued a second strip of paper on top of the first, creating a [...] "tape" [...] of primer. The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper. In 1845, Edward Maynard patented his new firearm invention which in later years, would be widely used in the American Civil War.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> is a {{detonator}} {{widely used}} in explosives.|$|E
50|$|First {{used as a}} priming {{composition}} in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in muzzle-loading firearms. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers for self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition. <b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, lead styphnate and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Hank has {{identified}} that the gas mask {{found in the}} desert belongs {{to the high school}} chemistry lab, and he visits Walter at school. They take inventory to find other equipment missing and Hank suspects that a student that got a hold of the lab key. Later, Hank comes to arrest a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys as well as had a previous record for drug possession. Walter feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about him being in the hospital. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.Now starting to lose his hair from the chemotherapy, Walter decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name [...] "Heisenberg". Walter demands $50,000 from Tuco, which includes the price of the meth he took from Jesse and another $15,000 for Jesse's treatment. Seeing Walter with another bag of material, Tuco calls Walter out on this, but Walter reveals that the bag contains <b>fulminated</b> <b>mercury,</b> and throws a piece against the floor. The entire floor is shaken by force, knocking them all off their feet. Walter threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground, but Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as offering Walter and Jesse $70,000 for producing two pounds of meth a week. Walter leaves the building, and, once back in his car, hyperventilates while realizing what he has just done, resulting in him screaming in both anger and satisfaction.|$|R
50|$|During his {{experimental}} career, he {{lost his}} left hand in a <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> explosion in 1894.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863 Alfred Nobel {{realized}} that although nitroglycerin {{could not be}} detonated by a fuse, it could be detonated by the explosion of a small charge of gunpowder, which in turn was ignited by a fuse. [...] Within a year, he was adding <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> to the gunpowder charges of his detonators, and by 1867 he was using small copper capsules of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> triggered by a fuse, to detonate nitroglycerin.|$|E
50|$|HMTD {{is a more}} {{powerful}} initiating explosive than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> but its poor thermal and chemical stability prevents its use in detonators.|$|E
50|$|In 1868, Henry Julius Smith of Boston, Massachusetts, {{introduced}} a cap that combined a spark gap ignitor and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> the first electric cap able to detonate dynamite.|$|E
50|$|Fulminic {{acid and}} its salts (fulminates), for {{instance}} <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> are very dangerous, {{and are often}} used as detonators for other explosive materials, and are examples of primary explosives. The vapors also are toxic.|$|E
50|$|A {{thorough}} {{search of}} the two rooms in his parents' house where Fuchs had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which he would have needed to produce and handle the unstable explosives (including <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> and nitroglycerol) contained in his IEDs.|$|E
50|$|Other {{materials}} such as DDNP (diazo dinitro phenol) are also used as the primary charge {{to reduce the amount}} of lead emitted into the atmosphere by mining and quarrying operations. Old detonators used <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> as the primary, often mixed with potassium chlorate to yield better performance.|$|E
50|$|Diazodinitrophenol (DDNP) was {{the first}} diazo {{compound}} produced; it was subsequently used to make dyes and explosives. It forms yellow crystals in pure form; however, the color of impure forms may vary from dark yellow to green to dark brown. It is soluble in acetic acid, acetone, concentrated hydrochloric acid, most non-polar solvents and is slightly soluble in water. A solution of cold sodium hydroxide {{may be used to}} destroy it. DDNP may be desensitized by immersing it in water, as it does not react in water at normal temperature. It is less sensitive to impact but more powerful than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> and almost as powerful as lead azide. The sensitivity of DDNP to friction is much less than that of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> but it is approximately that of lead azide.|$|E
50|$|Drebbel's {{most famous}} written work was Een kort Tractaet van de Natuere der Elementen (A short {{treatise}} {{of the nature}} of the elements) (Haarlem, 1621). He was also involved in the invention of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> He also discovered that mixtures of “spiritus vini” with mercury and silver in “aqua fortis” could explode.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{fulminate}} is the {{potassium salt}} of the fulminate ion. Its only use, aside from chemical demonstrations, {{is in the}} percussion caps for some early rifles. Usually prepared by reacting a potassium amalgam with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> it is much less sensitive due to the ionic bond between potassium and carbon, unlike the weaker covalent bond between mercury and carbon.|$|E
50|$|Amatol {{should not}} be stored in {{containers}} made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration. Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. Primary explosives such as <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as tetryl.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary {{detonators}} {{usually take}} the form of ignition-based explosives. Whilst they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using safety fuse, and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide, Pb(N3)2, silver azide (AgN3) and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> Hg(ONC)2.|$|E
50|$|Tetrazene is {{slightly}} more impact-sensitive than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> When pressed enough, its sensitivity is reduced or destroyed; {{this is known}} as dead pressing. It also decomposes in boiling water. In contact with fire, it readily explodes, producing large amounts of black smoke. It is prepared by reacting sodium nitrite with an aminoguanidine salt dissolved in acetic acid at 30-40 °C.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875, H. Julius Smith—and then in 1887 Perry G. Gardner of North Adams, Massachusetts—developed {{electric}} detonators that combined a hot wire detonator with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> explosive. [...] These {{were the first}} generally modern type blasting caps. Modern caps use different explosives and separate primary and secondary explosive charges, but are generally {{very similar to the}} Gardner and Smith caps.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{inorganic}} compounds include the inorganic salts and complexes of the carbon-containing cyanide, cyanate, fulminate, thiocyanate and cyanamide ions. Examples of cyanides are copper cyanide (CuCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN), examples of cyanates are potassium cyanate (KNCO) and silver cyanate (AgNCO), examples of fulminates are silver fulminate (AgOCN) and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> (HgOCN) and {{an example of}} a thiocyanate is potassium thiocyanate (KSCN).|$|E
5000|$|Incandescent {{particles}} {{were found}} most effective for igniting smokeless powder after the primary explosive gasses had heated the powder grains. Artillery charges frequently included a smaller quantity of black powder to be ignited by the primer, so incandescent potassium carbonate would spread fire through the smokeless powder. [...] Potassium chlorate {{was added to}} <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> priming mixtures so incandescent potassium chloride would have a similar effect in small arms cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Early primers {{used the}} same <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> used in 19th century {{percussion}} caps. Black powder could be effectively ignited by hot mercury released upon decomposition. Disadvantages of mercuric primers became evident with smokeless powder loadings. <b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> slowly decomposed in storage until the remaining energy was insufficient for reliable ignition. [...] Decreased ignition energy with age had not been recognized as a problem with black-powder loadings because black powder could be ignited by as little energy as a static electricity discharge. Smokeless powder often required more thermal energy for ignition. [...] Misfires and hang fires became common as the remaining priming compound sputtered in old primers. A misfire would result if the priming compound either failed {{to react to the}} firing pin fall or extinguished prior to igniting the powder charge. A hang fire is a perceptible delay between the fall of the firing pin and discharge of the firearm. In extreme cases, the delay might be sufficient to be interpreted as a misfire, and the cartridge could fire as the action was being opened or the firearm pointed in an inappropriate direction.|$|E
50|$|Silver {{fulminate}} {{was first}} prepared in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard {{in his research}} project to prepare a large variety of fulminates. Along with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> {{it is the only}} fulminate stable enough for commercial use. Detonators using silver fulminate were used to initiate picric acid in 1885, but since have only been used by the Italian navy. The current commercial use has been in producing non-damaging novelty noisemakers as children's toys and tricks.|$|E
5000|$|Pauly {{moved to}} Paris in 1802 {{where he worked}} on {{designing}} an airship and maintained contact with the weapon manufacturer of Saint-Étienne. In 1804 he designed an automatic bridge. Pauly used for himself the title [...] "Colonel Jean Samuel Pauly". He established a gunsmith worshop where he developed <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> platina. In 1809 he employed the German Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse who would later become {{the inventor of the}} famous Dreyse rifle.|$|E
50|$|Although {{an early}} {{percussion}} fuze appeared in 1650 that used a flint to create sparks to ignite the powder, the shell had {{to fall in}} a particular way for this to work and this did not work with spherical projectiles. An additional problem was finding a suitably stable ‘percussion powder’. Progress was not possible until the discovery of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> in 1800, leading to priming mixtures for small arms patented by the Rev Alexander Forsyth, and the copper percussion cap in 1818.|$|E
50|$|Dynamite is {{moderately}} {{sensitive to}} shock. Shock resistance tests are usually {{carried out with}} a drop-hammer: about 100 mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between 0.5 and 10 kg is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved. With a hammer of 2 kg, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2 cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5 cm, dynamite with 15 to 30 cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50 cm.|$|E
5000|$|Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) is a [...] high {{explosive}} organic compound. The theorized structure lent itself well to acting as an initiating, or primary explosive. While still quite sensitive to shock and friction, it was relatively stable {{compared to other}} initiating explosives of the time, such as <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> and proved to be relatively inexpensive and easy to synthesise. As such, it was quickly taken up as a primary explosive in mining applications. However, it has since been superseded by even more stable compounds such as tetryl.|$|E
50|$|As {{a skilled}} chemist, Łukaszewicz {{was chosen as}} the person to build three bombs that were to kill the tsar. To make it easier to hide the bomb, he {{concealed}} it in a copy of Grunberg's Medical Dictionary. The inside was filled with shrapnel and dynamite, while the fuse was made of a tube filled with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> Two additional bombs were prepared in case the main did not detonate as planned. To make the explosion more lethal, Łukaszewicz decided to fill all three bombs with capsules filled with strychnine.|$|E
50|$|In Paris in 1808, in {{association}} with French gunsmith François Prélat, Jean Samuel Pauly created the first fully self-contained cartridges: the cartridges incorporated a copper base with integrated <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> primer powder (the major innovation of Pauly), a round bullet and either brass or paper casing. The cartridge was loaded through the breech and fired with a needle. The needle-activated central-fire breech-loading gun would become a major feature of firearms thereafter. The corresponding firearm was also developed by Pauly. Pauly made an improved version, which was protected by a patent on 29 September 1812.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. Blasting caps and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe. Early blasting caps also used silver fulminate {{but it has been}} replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.Silver azide is still used sometimes,but very rarely due to its high price.|$|E
50|$|In January 1799 he {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1800 awarded their Copley medal {{for his work on}} mercury. He {{discovered}} <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> a powerful primary explosive. In 1813 he invented a method of refining sugar which involved boiling the cane juice not in an open kettle, but in a closed vessel heated by steam and held under partial vacuum. At reduced pressure, water boils at a lower temperature, and so Howard's development both saved fuel and reduced the amount of sugar lost through caramelisation. The invention, known as Howard's vacuum pan, is still in use.|$|E
