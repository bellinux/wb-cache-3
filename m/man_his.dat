5|$|Malcolm Reed, {{played by}} Dominic Keating, is {{tactical}} {{officer of the}} Enterprise, also in charge of ship security. Reed comes {{from a long line}} of Royal Navy men, but joined Starfleet because of his fear of drowning. An extremely taciturn <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> own family, when asked, could not name his favorite food (pineapple).|$|E
5|$|She was {{eventually}} revealed as a hoax. A young <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> advances rebuffed by a woman, {{had started the}} story {{as a means of}} revenge. It was reported that the stream of visitors wishing to meet the Pig-faced Lady became so annoying, the young woman in question was forced to move house.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rose Bowl, Shaughnessy lent help {{to his old}} {{associate}} George Halas of the Chicago Bears, {{which in}} Sid Luckman, had found a quarterback well suited to the T formation. Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy devised a series of counter plays to confuse their opponent, which on game film had shown a tendency to shift linebackers {{in the direction of}} the motion <b>man.</b> <b>His</b> preparations helped Chicago rout Washington, 73–0.|$|E
60|$|With admirable {{diplomacy}} the old <b>man</b> kept <b>his</b> eyes roaming in {{the space}} between the two <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> words might have been addressed to either. Though neither wicked nor perverse, he was seeking for a sign.|$|R
60|$|First to Captain Boanerges, {{for he was}} the chief; to him, I say, {{was given}} ten {{thousand}} <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> ensign was Mr. Thunder; he bare the black colours, and his scutcheon was three burning thunderbolts (Mark 3:17). The second captain was Captain Conviction; to him was also given ten thousand <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> ensign's name was Mr. Sorrow; he did bear the pale colours, and his scutcheon was {{the book of the}} law wide open, from whence issued a flame of fire (Deut 33:2). The third captain was Captain Judgment; to him was given ten thousand <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> ensign's name was Mr. Terror; he bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was a burning fiery furnace (Matt 13:40,41). The fourth captain was Captain Execution; to him was given ten thousand <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> ensign was Mr. Justice; he also bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was a fruitless tree, with an axe lying at the root thereof (Matt 3:10).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Zumalacárregui had 8,500 <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> generals were Ituralde, Guibelalde, Villareal, and Miguel Gómez Damas.|$|R
5|$|By {{chance he}} then runs into another <b>man</b> <b>his</b> age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{would bear}} a harsh change of fortune: after one more {{influential}} success in November 1792 at Jemappes, {{he was by}} the following year a broken <b>man.</b> <b>His</b> army had suffered such catastrophic losses that he defected to the royalist side {{for the rest of}} his life. Kellermann, however, continued in a long and distinguished military career. In 1808 he was ennobled by Napoleon and became Duke of Valmy.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1924 {{to appear in}} The Passing Show of 1924 which ran for four months beginning in September. Also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and toured London, Brussels and Berlin. It was during an engagement at the London Palladium that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another <b>man.</b> <b>His</b> contract was cancelled and he {{was never able to}} obtain a work permit for England again.|$|E
50|$|Sumoroy did {{not make}} peace with the Spaniards. He was killed by <b>his</b> own <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> head {{separated}} from his body, {{was presented to the}} Don Genis de Rojas by one of <b>his</b> <b>men.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ronen Chen {{was never}} very {{interested}} in designing clothing for <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> clients are {{women of all ages}} and constitutions.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pike is of {{the elder}} race of <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> {{endurance}} is prodigious. Watch and watch, and all watches, he held the poop.|$|R
5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.|$|E
5|$|Non-comedic roles after Airplane! {{included}} Prom Night (1980) and Creepshow (1982), both horror films, and as {{a dramatic}} and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy Soul <b>Man.</b> <b>His</b> last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client of a prostitute killed in self-defence by Barbra Streisand's character, Claudia Draper, in Martin Ritt's courtroom drama Nuts (1987).|$|E
5|$|To <b>man</b> <b>his</b> signals units, Simpson {{sought to}} obtain some 4,000 Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) personnel. Two special signal {{training}} battalions were activated to cater for them, and Simpson inspected the 2nd Signal Training Battalion (AWAS) at Ivanhoe Grammar School with Lieutenant Colonel Sybil Irving on 6 July 1942. By 1945, the Australian Corps of Signals numbered some 25,000 men and women. The {{large numbers of}} women serving in Signals units caused friction between Irving and Simpson over what degree of control he exercised over them.|$|E
50|$|The Affair of Cedar Bridge was {{the last}} {{conflict}} of the American Revolutionary War. In December 1782 Captain Richard Shreve, with Patriot forces from Burlington, came upon Bacon and <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> Bacon and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> fired upon Shreve and the Patriots as they approached Cedar Bridge, wounding him and three others. Bacon and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> escaped, although several of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> were captured.|$|R

5|$|While Leonardo's {{experimentation}} followed clear scientific methods, {{a recent}} and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo {{as a scientist}} by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance <b>Man,</b> <b>his</b> theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga. As a young <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> father granted him the region of Avaradrano {{surrounding}} the village, and while his father still lived he managed the daily affairs of state in Avaradrano without taking the title of king. He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its first set of defensive walls, ditches and gates. The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, {{the only one in the}} cultural category in Madagascar. He became an independent king upon his father's death and the resulting partition of the Kingdom of Imerina in 1710, from which he received Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest territory. He died around 1730 and was buried at Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to <b>man</b> <b>his</b> lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
60|$|He had no {{difficulty}} in <b>manning</b> <b>his</b> ship, as {{a sufficient number}} of the Jason’s old crew volunteered, and he was soon ready for service.|$|R
25|$|Lin Biao did {{not present}} the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He {{was ten years}} younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> Lin kept <b>his</b> distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There are no stories {{reflecting}} warmth and affection for <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> <b>His</b> fellow Red Army commanders respected Lin, but when he spoke, it was all business...|$|R

5|$|FBI agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and {{his partner}} of five years, Robert Danzig (Joe Flanigan), are {{pursuing}} an arms dealer; while Lee apprehends the <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> partner is killed by a second, mysterious man with translucent skin and seemingly superhuman abilities. The skin of Danzig's body also becomes translucent after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing their intentions. Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about {{the appearance of the}} killer, but are unable to identify him by name.|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
5|$|The Tolkiens {{had four}} {{children}}: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very {{devoted to his}} children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow <b>Man</b> (<b>his</b> gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.|$|E

50|$|After his {{military}} service, Alexander Joseph Wolff {{was given a}} grant of land in Valcartier (Lower Canada) with <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> When <b>his</b> ship docked at Halifax in 1824, he and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> made preparations for a long overland march to Quebec City {{in the dead of}} winter. On the way, several of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> died of exposure and hardship.|$|R
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong <b>man,</b> <b>his</b> success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E
5|$|Tracy is an overachieving {{high school}} junior, {{preparing}} for an easy election {{to the office of}} student body president after three years of extracurricular toil. Her assumptions of an unopposed victory are dashed when two unexpected challengers enter the race: friendly and popular athlete Paul Metzler, sidelined from the football team by a skiing accident, and Paul's younger adopted sister Tammy, a moody, sarcastic rebel. Paul has been coaxed into running by election supervisor Jim McAllister, a well-liked civics teacher nursing a deep resentment towards Tracy since her affair with Jim's best friend and fellow teacher cost the <b>man</b> <b>his</b> job and family.|$|E
