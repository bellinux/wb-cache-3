40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} {{a simple and}} low-cost spray coating process for producing high performance CO (carbon monoxide) sensors utilizing toluene-based gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). Thanks to the success synthesis of Au-NPs in toluene, this low surface tension organic solvent prevents Au-NPs from colligation.

To compare with the typical metal oxide based CO sensors that have to work at a higher working temperature of about 150 ~ 350 oC, the produced sensor can work at room temperature and have a better detection limit for CO gas (5 ppm). Experimental results indicate good linear sensitivity under repeated <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> <b>concentration</b> range from 5 – 250 ppm (R 2 = 0. 996).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between acoustic attenuation and solid content in a liquid carrier. Using such a relationship, two techniques were discussed to enable precise <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> different <b>concentrations</b> of Kaolin in water. The first technique uses the fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) amplitude, while the second technique uses the attenuation coefficient’s gradient to discriminate the different concentrations. In the past, others have used the ultrasound’s velocity and attenuation measurements to characterise the different concentrations of Kaolin in water, but many have focused only on FFT measurements. This hinders precise measurements as it relies heavily on the positional information where the centre frequency is defined. Hence, in this paper the above second technique was suggested. The measurements presented were collected using a pair of transducers placed invasively in a cell facing opposite each other (Figure 1). This is known as the Pitch-catch mode and it is commonly used in ultrasound measurements. Such a method provides a direct and the shortest path for the sound wave to travel from the transmitter to the receiver.

The interaction between the anionic poly{ 1, 4 -phenylene-[9, 9 -bis(4 -phenoxy-butylsulfonate) ]fluorene- 2, 7 -diyl}copolymer (PBS−PFP) and cationic gemini surfactants α,ω-(CmH 2 m+ 1 N+(CH 3) 2) 2 (CH 2) s(Br-) 2 (m-s-m; m = 12, s = 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12) has been studied experimentally in aqueous solution. These surfactants are chosen to see whether molecular recognition and self-assembly occurs between the oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolyte and gemini surfactant when the spacer length on the surfactant {{is similar to the}} intercharge separation on the polymer. Without surfactants, PBS−PFP exists as aggregates. These are broken up upon addition of gemini surfactants. However, as anticipated, the behavior strongly depends upon spacer length (s). Fluorescence measurements show three surfactant concentration regimes: At low concentrations (< 2 × 10 - 6 M) quenching occurs and is most marked with the small spacer 12 - 2 - 12; at intermediate concentrations (2 × 10 - 6 − 10 - 3 M), fluorescence intensity is constant, with a 12 -carbon spacer 12 - 12 - 12 showing the strongest fluorescence; above the critical micelle concentration (CMC; 10 - 3 M) increases in emission intensity are seen in all cases and are largest with the intermediate spacers 12 - 5 - 12 and 12 - 6 - 12, where the spacer length most closely matches the distance between monomer units on the polymer. With longer spacer length surfactants, surface tension <b>measurements</b> <b>for</b> <b>concentrations</b> below the CMC reveal the presence of polymer−surfactant aggregates at the air−water interface, possibly reflecting increased hydrophobicity. Above the CMC, small-angle neutron scattering experiments for the 12 - 6 - 12 system show the presence of spherical aggregates, both for the pure surfactant and for polyelectrolyte/gemini mixtures. Molecular dynamics simulations help rationalize these observations and show that there is a very fine balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. With the shortest spacer 12 - 2 - 12, Coulombic interactions are dominant, while for the longest spacer 12 - 12 - 12 the driving force involves hydrophobic interactions. Qualitatively, with the intermediate 12 - 5 - 12 and 12 - 6 - 12 systems, the optimum balance is observed between Coulombic and hydrophobic interactions, explaining their strong fluorescence enhancement.
