40|$|We {{identified}} two novel naturally occurring mutations (W 74 L and L 77 R) {{in the small}} <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Mutation L 77 R alone resulted in > 10 -fold-reduced secretion of virions. In addition, the 2. 8 -fold reduction of the extracellular HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) of mutant L 77 R from transfected Huh 7 cells appeared to be correlated with a 1. 7 -fold reduction of intracellular HBsAg, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Surprisingly, opposite to the ELISA results, Western blot analysis revealed a near- 10 -fold-increased level of the intracellular mutant small <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> protein. The discrepancy between ELISA and Western blot data was due to significant accumulation of the mutant L 77 R HBsAg in the intracellular pellet fraction. In contrast to HBsAg, the secretion of HBeAg was normal in L 77 R-transfected cells. The wild-type HBsAg was usually more diffuse and evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, often outside the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, as observed by immunofluorescence assay. In contrast, the L 77 R mutant HBsAg tends to be highly restricted within the ER and Golgi, often accumulated in the Golgi compartments distal from the nucleus. The almost exclusive retention in the ER-Golgi of L 77 R HBsAg was similar to what was observed when the large envelope protein was overexpressed. These multiple aberrant phenotypes of mutant L 77 R can be corrected by a second naturally occurring <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> mutation, W 74 L. Despite the accumulation of L 77 R HBsAg in ER-Golgi of transfected Huh 7 cells, we detected no increase in Grp 78 mRNA and proteins, which are common markers for ER stress response...|$|R

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is {{coated with}} large (L), middle (M), and small (<b>S)</b> <b>envelope</b> proteins encoded by coinfecting hepatitis B virus (HBV). To study {{the role of the}} HBV envelope proteins in the assembly and infectivity of HDV, we produced three types of recombinant particles in Huh 7 cells by transfection with HBV DNA and HDV cDNA: (i) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing the <b>S</b> HBV <b>envelope</b> protein only, (ii) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing <b>S</b> and M proteins, and (iii) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing <b>S,</b> M, and L proteins. Although the resulting S-, SM-, and SML-HDV particles contained both hepatitis delta antigen and HDV RNA, only particles coated with all three envelope proteins (SML) showed evidence of infectivity in an in vitro culture system susceptible to HDV infection. We concluded that the L HBV envelope protein, and more specifically the pre-S 1 domain, is important for infectivity of HDV particles and that the M protein, which has been reported to bear a site for binding to polymerized albumin in the pre-S 2 domain, is not sufficient for infectivity. Our data also show that the helper HBV is not required for initiation of HDV infection. The mechanism by which the L protein may affect HDV infectivity is discussed herein...|$|R
30|$|This {{variation}} {{noted in}} oxygen surface groups is further confirmed upon observing the XPS results of O 1 s. In the first place, {{there was a}} significant increase in the atomic percent of oxygen (Table 1) after oxidizing the originally prepared CNTs. This oxygen content is strongly reduced after reacting OCNT with the amine due to the formation of the corresponding amide. This provides insight into the type of interaction existing between acidic oxygen groups and basic amine. This could be further elucidated after deconvolution of the O 1 <b>s</b> <b>envelope</b> into three peaks [10]. There was a noticeable decrease (to almost half its initial value) in the COOH peak (at about 534.4 eV) when comparing ACNT with OCNT, which suggests acid/base reaction to form water and the amide function. The nitrogen functional group at ACNT is further confirmed by the presence of a N 1 s peak at 399.9 eV.|$|R

We previously reported a novel form of glomerulonephritis with glomerular IgA deposits following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. We investigated the role of S. aureus related antigens in the immunopathogenesis of IgA nephropathy by producing several monoclonal antibodies against S. aureus surface antigens and determining the epitopes of deposited antigens in patients with IgA nephropathy. MethodsCell membrane proteins were isolated from cultured S. aureus. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against these proteins were generated, and their target epitopes were determined by antibody affinity chromatography and amino acid sequence analysis, and by monoclonal antibody screening of Escherichia coli clones transfected with plasmids from the Lambda S. aureus Genomic Library. Renal biopsy specimens from 116 patients with IgA nephropathy and 122 patients with other forms of renal disease were examined for glomerular antigen depositions by immunofluorescence microscopy.

40|$|Hand {{forces are}} {{important}} factors for risk assessment of {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS). 1 Grip force {{is one of the}} most important force components in the operation of powered hand tools. A considerable number of studies on grip force have been reported. It is well known that the grip force applied on a cylindrical handle is not uniformly distributed on each axis across the center of the handle cross-section. 2 Therefore, maximum and minimum orientations of grip force exist around the handle. Such orientations have not been clearly identified. In a recently proposed international standard (ISO/CD 15230, 2005), 3 it is stated that the direction of the main gripping force is generally parallel to the z-axis defined in ISO 8727. 4 This assertion is questionable, and further examinations are required. The objective of this study was to establish a fundamental theory on the distribution of the grip force around cylindrical handles. Methods As shown in Fig. 1, the grip force is defined as a vector composed of normal and shear components (FN & FT) in this study. Fig. 2 shows the hand coordinate system defined in this study, together with the ISO systems. 1, 4 Based on this novel grip force definition, we derived four fundamental properties and a theorem. More significantly, we formulated a novel hypothesis: similar to <b>Mohr</b> <b>s</b> circle of stress, the normal and shear components can be represented approximately using an ellipse on the plane of the two force coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3. The maximum and minimum grip normal forces are termed as the first principal grip force (F 1) and the second principal grip normal force (F 2), respectively. Their corresponding orientations are termed as the first principal grip angle (? 1) and the second principal grip angle (? 2). A series of experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis.

This study was focused on a domain of the S protein that is exposed in the cytoplasm during synthesis and thereby represented {{a good candidate for}} interaction with the viral nucleocapsid during virion assembly. The mutations consisted of deletion/insertions spanning the entire cytosolic domain of S between amino acid residues 24 and 80.

Transfection of 20 suchmutants in a human hepa-toma cell line identified many with severe impairment in virion secretion, which can be rescued to various extents by coexpres-sion of wild-type envelope proteins or introduction of a novel glycosylation site. Consistent with their role in maintaining intra-or intermolecular disulfide bonds, cysteine residues within the “a ” determinant are critical for virion secretion.

PED has a high infectivity and a particularly significant mortality in piglets (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978). The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, is responsible for PED. The PEDV genome is approximately 28  Kb in length and is composed of seven open reading frames (ORF) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (<b>S),</b> <b>envelope</b> (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three major non-structural proteins, including replicases 1 a and 1 b, and ORF 3 (Song and Park 2012).

Moreover, the S protein is associated with the induction of host neutralizing antibodies, growth adaptation in vitro, and attenuation of virulence in vivo (Song and Park 2012). Thus, study of the S glycoprotein has been essential in understanding the genetic relationships between PEDV strains, the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, and the development of vaccines (Song and Park 2012; Chen et al. 2012); (Temeeyasen et al. 2014).|$|R

However, comparison between the intensities of shoulder A and peak B reflects the sp 2 to sp 3 transition trend similar to that observed in Figure[*] 7. Here, the intensity difference between A and B reaches the minimum and stabilizes after ion irradiation in energy range between 1.5 and 4 keV. Slight increase in the intensity difference is found at energies above 4 keV. Although, the shape of derivative of Auger transition C KVV spectra gives the indication of the ion irradiation effect, the D parameter values obtained from these spectra fail to account for sp 2 /sp 3 hybridization transition, and reliable quantification of sp 2 /sp 3 ratio is only obtained from the deconvolution of the XPS C (1 <b>s)</b> <b>envelope</b> as explained before and shown in Figure[*] 6.

40|$|The carboxyl-terminal {{domain of}} the small (<b>S)</b> <b>envelope</b> protein of {{hepatitis}} B virus was subjected to mutagenesis to identify sequences important for the envelopment of the nucleocapsid during morphogenesis of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) virions. The mutations consisted of carboxyl-terminal truncations of 4 to 64 amino acid residues and small combined deletions and insertions spanning the entire hydrophobic domain between residues 163 and 224. Truncation of as few as 14 residues partially inhibited glycosylation and secretion of S and prevented assembly or stability of HDV virions. Short internal combined deletions and insertions were tolerated for secretion of subviral particles with the exceptions of those affecting residues 164 to 173 and 219 to 223. However, mutants competent for subviral particle secretion had a reduced capacity for HDV assembly {{compared to that of}} the wild type. One exception was a mutant carrying a deletion of residues 214 to 218, which exhibited a twofold increase in HDV assembly (or stability), whereas deletions of residues 179 to 183, 194 to 198, and 199 to 203 were the most inhibitory. Substitutions of single amino acids between residues 194 and 198 demonstrated that HDV assembly deficiency could be assigned to the replacement of the tryptophan residue at position 196.

The X-ray emission of the remnant further shows an apparent shadow casted by the arc in the opposite direction of the explosion site, consistent with the blocking of the SN ejecta by the envelope. This scenario supports the single degenerate binary origin of Tycho 2 ̆ 7 s SN. The properties of the X-ray arc, together with the previous detection of the companion candidate and its space velocity by Ruiz-Lapuente et al. and Hernández et al., enable us to further infer that (1) the progenitor binary has a period of 4. 9 + 5. 3 – 3. 0 days, (2) the companion gained a kick velocity of 42 ± 30 km s– 1, and (3) the stripped envelope mass is about 0. 0016 (≤ 0. 0083) M.

Whereas the pivotal function of the pre-S region of L in nucleocapsid envelopment has been established, the contribution of its S domain and the S protein is less clear. In this study, we evaluated {{the role of the}} cytosolic S loop, common to L and S, in HBV assembly by performing mutagenesis experiments. To distinguish between the effect of the mutations on either envelope or virion formation, we investigated the ability of the mutants to assemble into secretable subviral empty envelopes and to replace the wild-type proteins in virion maturation, respectively. Virion production was found to be blocked by each of the secretion-competent deletion and substitution mutants SΔ 35 – 39, SΔ 40 – 46, SΔ 50 – 56, and Sς 56 – 59, while an insertion within the loop is tolerated. Surprisingly, single mutations of the arginines terminating the loop had an opposite effect: while a conservative exchange of Arg- 73 still allowed virion formation, the same mutation of Arg- 79 did not. The critical sequences and/or structural requirements of the cytosolic S loop involved in nucleocapsid envelopment primarily act in the S background.

This mechanism {{is essential for the}} eventual positioning of the receptor-binding domain {{on the surface of the}} virus particle and in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) is dependent on the small (<b>S)</b> <b>envelope</b> protein as part of the assembly process. In this study, we report the identification of a third envelope protein, St, derived from the S protein and carrying functions previously attributed to S. Antibody mapping and mutagenesis studies indicated St to be C terminally truncated, spanning the N-terminal transmembrane domain (TM 1) plus the adjacent cysteine loop. We have previously shown that the mutation of two conserved polar residues in TM 1 of S (SAA) eliminates L translocation and assembly. A plasmid expressing a functional equivalent of St was able to rescue assembly, demonstrating that this assembly defect is due to mutations of the corresponding residues in St and not in S per se. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that St directly affects L protein cellular localization. These results indicate that St acts as a viral chaperone for L folding, remaining associated with the DHBV envelope upon secretion. The presence of St at a molar ratio of half that of L suggests that it is St which regulates L translocation to 50 %...|$|R
