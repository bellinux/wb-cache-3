[...] Although the capital moved to Austin in 1840, {{the newspaper}} remained in Houston.

Governor Sam Houston once referred to Moore as that [...] "'lying scribbler of the Telegraph, whose one arm could write more <b>malicious</b> <b>falsehoods</b> than any man with two arms'".Many of the paper's articles were aimed at attracting immigrants to Texas, or retaining those who had recently arrived. Articles emphasized the good character of recent settlers (as opposed to the widespread belief that residents of Texas were scoundrels) and the advantages {{of living in the}} country. [...] Through much of 1837, Moore wrote a series of articles describing the natural resources of Texas and the geography of various regions of the nations. [...] Moore's series on the geography of Texas was in 1840 compiled into a book Maps and Descriptions of Texas. The book was reprinted in 1844 as Description of Texas. [...] The articles were widely quoted in other newspapers and journals; an 1843 issue of Southern Agriculturist copied at least one Telegraph article in whole.|$|R

What does it matter to me what they said?--I know him better. But you have been prejudiced against him from the beginning, for no other reason but because I loved him. Nothing but selfishness was at the bottom of that feeling. You imagined that marriage would put an end to our friendship, and thought nothing about my happiness, but only of your own." ...|$|R
