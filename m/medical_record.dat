40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>records</b> {{search is}} {{challenging}} {{because of the}} inherent implicit knowledge within <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> and queries. Such knowledge is known to the medical practitioners but may be hidden from a search system. For example, when searching for the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> of patients with a heart disease, medical practitioners commonly know that the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> of patients taking the amiodarone medicine are relevant, since this drug is used to combat a heart disease. In this paper, we argue that leveraging such implicit knowledge improves the retrieval effectiveness, since it provides new evidence to infer the relevance of <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> towards a query. Specifically, using a novel concept-based representation for both <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> and queries, we expand the queries by inferring additional conceptual relationships from domain-specific resources {{as well as by}} extracting informative concepts from the top-ranked <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our proposed approach {{in the context of the}} TREC 2011 and 2012 <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> track.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Medical</b> <b>records</b> ward, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources to access to information about patient’s disease, how they cured and how the management and personnel work. This ward shows it’s efficiency effectively when regards professional standards about organization and structure, equipments and human resources, recipes and policies, performance and services. This research has done to determine performance of the teaching hospitals of Hamedan University of Medical Sciences: 2009. Material and Methods: This research was descriptive and has done by using valid and reliable questionnaire and interview. In this research performance of <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> ward and it’s units, has been evaluated and hospitals have been compared togetherResults: This research show that Beesat’s <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> ward, have highest score in performance (91. 2 %) and Beheshti’s <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> ward, have lowest score in performance (44. 7). The most important problem in all of them was lack of suitable space. Conclusion: We offer these solutions for improve in <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> performance: use educated and specialist personnel in field of <b>medical</b> <b>records,</b> establish workshops and reeducation classes for <b>medical</b> <b>record’s</b> personnel and dedicate suitable space and equipments for <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> ward...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Handheld {{electronic}} <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> {{are expected}} to improve physician performance and patient care. To confirm this, we performed a systematic review of the evidence assessing the effects of handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> on clinical care. Methods To conduct the systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library from 1966 through September 2005. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated effects on practitioner performance or patient outcomes of handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> compared to either paper <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> or desktop electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> Two reviewers independently reviewed citations, assessed full text articles and abstracted data from the studies. Results Two studies met our inclusion criteria. No other randomized controlled studies or non-randomized controlled trials were found that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were methodologically strong. The studies examined changes in documentation in orthopedic patients with handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> compared to paper charts, and both found an increase in documentation. Other effects noted with handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> were an increase in time to document {{and an increase in}} wrong or redundant diagnoses. Conclusion Handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> may improve documentation, but as yet, the number of studies is small and the data is restricted to one group of patients and a small group of practitioners. Further study is required to determine the benefits with handheld electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> especially in assessing clinical outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the competency acquired by <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> Officer (MRO) in private healthcare provider and the significance to have the knowledge, skills and experience in ensuring effective and efficient <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> management.

25|$|When {{the patient}} visits a doctor, the latter spends {{time with the}} former {{discussing}} his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record {{the information about the}} patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the <b>medical</b> <b>record,</b> and of which this <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the <b>medical</b> <b>record,</b> although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To compare {{two methods}} of data {{collection}} of patient-practitioner encounter data in general practice: from <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> consultation notes and from data recorded on encounter forms. Method. Data were collected from two sources: (i) <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> Study: {{a study of the}} efficacy of an intervention designed {{to improve the quality of}} <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> provided details of 3107 patient encounters with 163 general practitioners (GPs) which had been photocopied from medical records; and (ii) Australian Morbidy and Treatment Survey (AMTS) : from a national sample of 495 GPs and over 100 000 patient encounters, data from 47 GPs in the same geographical area as those in the <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> Study provided encounter forms for 10 392 patient encounters including details about patient demographics, reason for encounter, management, treatment, tests and investigations, admissions, referrals and planned follow-up. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) was used to code reasons for encounter and problems managed. Drugs were classified according to an in-house classification by generic name and broad drug group. Results. Patient details and all items of clinical information were recorded less frequently or were more often illegible in <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> than on encounter forms. There was a higher rate of management of problems classified as general or non-specific in the <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> A lower prescribing rate for drugs acting on the cardiovascular system was <b>recorded</b> in the <b>medical</b> <b>records,</b> but higher rates were found for antibiotics, drugs acting on the immune system and miscellaneous drugs. Coding of all data was more reliable both between and within coders using the data from the encounter forms compared to the <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> Conclusion. General practice data obtained from encounter forms are more comprehensive and are coded more reliably than those drawn from <b>medical</b> <b>records...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 1987 the Monitoring Project on Cardiovascular Risk Factors {{has been}} carried out in The Netherlands. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the {{agreement}} between the self-reported questionnaire information that was collected in this survey on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors and information from <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> METHODS: From 1987 to 1991, over 36, 000 men and women aged 20 - 59 years have participated in the Monitoring Project on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors, a cross-sectional population-based study. We compared self-reported information on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors with the general practitioners <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> from a sample of 899 hypertensive subjects. RESULTS: The highest proportion of positive self-reports could be confirmed by the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> for diabetes conditional on self-report of medication use for this condition (100 %), and a history of hypertension conditional on the presence of blood pressure recordings in the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> (91 %). The lowest percentage of positive self-reports confirmed by <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> was a family history of myocardial infarction (3 - 5 %). More than 80 % of the negative self-reports were confirmed by the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> for most conditions, except for history of hypertension, conditional on the presence of blood pressure recordings in the <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> (40 %). The overall agreement above chance was substantial for cerebrovascular disease (kappa = 0. 78) and diabetes (kappa = 0. 75), moderate for myocardial infarction (kappa = 0. 55), poor for myocardial infarction of the respondents' father (kappa = 0. 07) and mother (kappa = 0. 05), and fair to moderate for all other self-reported conditions. CONCLUSION: Agreement between self-reported information and <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> was variable. For further studies, self-reports of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors should preferably be complemented with information from other sources such as <b>medical</b> <b>records...</b>|$|R

Part I gives a historical perspective on US and Australian legislation regarding access to <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> Part II reviews commentary both for and against access in the United States and in Australia. Part II focuses on legal arguments from the recent decision concerning patient access to <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> by the Australian courts in Breen v. Williams. Further, Part II also briefly examines jurisprudence with respect to access rights in Canada and the United Kingdom. Part III argues that the United States and Australia should follow the international trend and grant access to <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> through legislation. Finally, this Note concludes that a right of access would not only be fairer to patients and improve the physician-patient relationship, but also would facilitate transnational legal actions where <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> are required but the countries 2 ̆ 7 laws differ on the right of access.
