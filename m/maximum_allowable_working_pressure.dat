40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{experimental}} work is to study the influence of surface temperature on both particulate fouling (PF) and crystallization fouling (CF) of heat transfer surfaces. For this target, an experimental setup, with a Perspex transparent test tube of 200 cm length and 5. 92 cm inner diameter has been designated and constructed. Water with a concentration of 1 g/lit in case of PF and 42 g/lit in case of CF {{is used as a}} test fluid. The experimental runs have been carried out under different surface temperatures of 70, 88 and 103 o C (for PF) and 62, 84 and 106 o C (for CF). The experimental run is carried out for a long enough time to reach the asymptotic fouling resistance (in PF) and the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>working</b> time of the heating coils (in CF). Obtained results show that the surface temperature has a great effect on the fouling resistance in both the fouling modes. In case of PF, both the fouling resistance and the asymptotic fouling resistance decrease with increasing the surface temperature, where in the case of CF, the fouling resistance increases in the same sense. The saw tooth effect is observed only in the PF fouling mode. In all the experimental tests, the delay time is very small and seems to approach zero. This may be due to high concentration of test fluids...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note contains {{miscellaneous information}} about the rectangular liquid helium supply tube for the D-Zero solenoid. The information is fairly superficial, but {{could be used as}} a starting point for a future engineer who is going to specify and puchase the tubing. The chimney contains 4 conductors attached to an aluminum liquid helium supply tube. Because good thermal contact is desired, the tube will have flat sides. Aluminum is chosen to match the thermal contraction coefficient of the superconductor's aluminum stabilizer. The type of aluminum is chosen as 6061 -T 6 because it's allowable stress in ANSI/ASME B 31. 3 is higher than for other alloys. A different alloy could be chosen for extrusion reasons. The highest pressures this tubing should see will be during a quench. Current calculations predict the peak pressure during a quench to be 520 psi a for one-way relieving and 250 psia for two way relieving. Whatever the final alloy selection, the tubing needs to have a high enough <b>allowable</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> There is very little room in the obround section of the chimney. In that portion the shape is rectangular, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 -inch) x 31. 8 mm (1. 25 -inch). A drawing shows the flow path cross section. This also could be changed for extrusion reasons if necessary.

50|$|Maximum {{allowable}} {{operating pressure}} or MAOP {{refers to the}} wall strength of a pressurized cylinder such as a pipeline or storage tank and how much pressure the walls may safely hold in normal operation. The MAOP {{is less than the}} MAWP (<b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure).</b> MAWP being the maximum pressure based on the design codes that the weakest component of a pressure vessel can handle. Commonly standard wall thickness components are used in fabricating pressurized equipment, and hence are able to withstand pressures above their design pressure. Design pressure is the maximum pressure a pressurized item can be exposed to. Due to the availability of standard wall thickness materials, many components will have a MAWP higher than the required design pressure. Relief valves are set at the design pressure of the pressurized item and sized to prevent the item under pressure from being over-pressurized. Depending on the design code that the pressurized item is designed, an over-pressure allowance can be used when sizing the relief valve. This is +10% for PD 5500, and ASME Section VIII div 1 & 2 (with an additional +10% allowance in ASME Section VIII for a fire relief case). ASME have different criteria for steam boilers.|$|E

The material for the larger specimens was type 304 stainless steel, while the smaller ones were made of both type 304 and type 347 stainless steel. The length chosen in each case was infinite from the buckling standpoint. The instantaneous-collapse test temperatures ranged from room temperature to 1200 deg F, and all the time- dependent collapse tests were made at 1200 deg F. The results show that tube out- of-roundness {{is a major factor}} in determining the collapse pressure. They also show that, under creepcollapse conditions, the critical pressure decreases rapidly with time, initially. This decrease is then followed by a leveling off, with very little change after the first few hundred hours. Although the load- carrying abilities of the 8. 0 -in. -OD specimens exceeded those for 4. 0 in. -OD specimens of the same material for instantaneous and short-time collapse conditions, the critical pressures were about the same in the two cases for collapse after several hundred hours.

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the pressure relief devices. The most critical characteristics of a pressure relief device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a pressure relief device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the pressure relief device must not exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of the equipment or system being protected.

40|$|International audienceComposite repair {{systems are}} used {{for many years to}} restore locally the pipe {{strength}} where it has been affected by damage such as wall thickness reduction due to corrosion, dent, lamination or cracks. Composite repair systems are commonly qualified, designed and installed according to ASME PCC 2 code or ISO 24817 standard requirements. In both of these codes, the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Allowable</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Pressure</b> (MAWP) of the damaged section must be determined to design the composite repair. To do so, codes such as ASME B 31 G for example for corrosion, are used. The composite repair systems is designed to “bridge the gap” between the MAWP of the damaged pipe and the original design pressure. The main weakness of available approaches is their applicability to combined loading conditions and various types of defects. The objective of this work is to set-up a “universal” methodology to design the composite repair by finite element calculations with directly taking into consideration the loading conditions and the influence of the defect on pipe strength (whatever its geometry and type). First a program of mechanical tests is defined to allow determining all the composite properties necessary to run the finite elements calculations. It consists in compression and tensile tests in various directions to account for the composite anisotropy and of Arcan tests to determine steel to composite interface behaviors in tension and shear. In parallel, a full scale burst test is performed on a repaired pipe section where a local wall thinning is previously machined. For this test, the composite repair was designed according to ISO 24817. Then, a finite element model integrating damaged pipe and composite repair system is built. It allowed simulating the test, comparing the results with experiments and validating damage models implemented to capture the various possible types of failures. In addition, sensitivity analysis considering composite properties variations evidenced by experiments are run. The composite behavior considered in this study is not time dependent. No degradation of the composite material strength due to ageing is taking into account. The roadmap for the next steps of this work is to clearly identify the ageing mechanisms, to perform tests in relevant conditions and to introduce ageing effects in the design process (and in particular in the composite constitutive laws) ...|$|E

A double-wall (i. e., a hydrogasification contained within a pressure shell) down-flow hydrogasification reactor was designed, engineered, constructed, commissioned and operated by APS, Phoenix, AZ. The reactor is ASME-certified under Section VIII with a rating of 1150 pounds per square inch gage (psig) <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> at 1950 degrees Fahrenheit ({degrees}F). The reaction zone had a 1. 75 inch inner diameter and 13 feet length. The initial testing of a sub-bituminous coal demonstrated ~ 50 % carbon conversion and ~ 10 % methane yield in the product gas under 1625 {degrees}F, 1000 psig pressure, with a 11 seconds (s) residence time, and 0. 4 hydrogen-to-coal mass ratio. Liquid by-products mainly contained Benzene, Toluene, Xylene (BTX) and tar. Char collected {{from the bottom of the}} reactor had 9000 -British thermal units per pound (Btu/lb) heating value. A three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamic model simulation of the hydrodynamics around the reactor head was utilized to design the nozzles for injecting the hydrogen into the gasifier to optimize gas-solid mixing to achieve improved carbon conversion.

We also need to account for the uncertainty of the distance.
