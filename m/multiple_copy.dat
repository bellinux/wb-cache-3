40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} processes for inserting into eucaryotic cells {{a multiplicity of}} DNA molecules which includes genes coding for desired proteinaceous materials. The insertion of <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of desired genes is accomplished by cotransformation with the desired genes and with amplifiable genes for a dominant selectable marker {{in the presence of}} successively higher amounts of an inhibitor. Alternatively, the insertion of <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of desired genes is accomplished by transformation using DNA molecules formed by ligating a DNA molecule including the desired gene to a DNA molecule which includes an amplifiable gene coding for a dominant selectable phenotype such as a gene associated with resistance to a drug in the presence of successively higher amounts of an agent such as a drug against which the gene confers resistance so that only those eucaryotic cells into which <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of the amplifiable gene have been inserted survive. Eucaryotic cells into which <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of the amplifiable gene have been inserted additionally include <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of the desired gene and may be used to produce <b>multiple</b> <b>copies</b> of proteinaceous molecules.

If one of the three additional players loses all of their health, they can spend an extra life to rejoin the game. However, if player one dies, gameplay resumes at the last checkpoint. Players who leave with full health give back one life to the pool of lives.|$|E

40|$|Yeast {{artificial}} chromosome (YAC) clones {{were arranged}} on {{the positions of}} {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers already mapped on the high-resolution genetic maps of rice chromosomes 3 and 11. From a total of 416 and 242 YAC clones selected by colony/Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 238 and 135 YAC clones were located on chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. For chromosomes 3 and 11, 24 YAC contigs and is-lands with total coverage of about 46 % and 12 contigs and islands with coverage of about 40 %, respectively, were assigned. Although many DNA fragments of <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> marker sequences could not be mapped to their original locations on the genetic map by Southern hybridization {{because of a lack of}} RFLP, the physical mapping of YAC clones could often assign specific locations of such <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> sequences on the genome.

40|$|Dynamical {{generation}} of 4 d gauge theories and gravity at low {{energy from the}} 3 d ones at high energy is studied, based on the fermion condensation mechanism recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi. For gravity, 4 d Einstein gravity is generated from the <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> of the 3 d ones, by referring to the two form gravity. Since the 3 d Einstein action without matter coupling is topological, ultraviolet divergences are less singular in our model. In the gauge model, matter fermions are introduced on the discrete lattice following Wilson. Then, the 4 d gauge interactions are correctly generated from the 3 d theories even in the left-right asymmetric theories of the standard model. In order for this to occur, the Higgs fields {{as well as the}} gauge fields of the extra dimension should be generated by the fermion condensates. Therefore, the {{generation of}} the 4 d standard model from the <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> of the 3 d ones is quite promising.
