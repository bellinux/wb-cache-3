5|$|Facekini: The facekini <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> a mask {{designed}} for swimmers and beachgoers which covers {{the head and}} reveals only the eyes, nose, and mouth. It was invented by Zhang Shifan, a former accountant from the coastal Chinese city of Qingdao.|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the El Goloso Baracks Museum in Madrid (Spain): {{the tank}} (Spanish {{tactical}} number 135) with Nationalist Spanish markings with pressed gun <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> {{armed with a}} Hotchkiss machine gun instead of a DT tank machine gun. Produced in 1936. The anti-aircraft machine gun and the hand-rail radio antenna are late dummies.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is indicated}} {{in a variety}} of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, breathing, and oxygenating the blood. In these circumstances, oxygen supplementation using a simple face <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> inadequate.|$|E
50|$|Medical oxygen <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> held {{in place}} by medical {{personnel}} or the user by hand, or they may be fitted with a lightweight elastic headband so the <b>mask</b> can <b>be</b> removed quickly. Full-face <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> secured by several straps. Tightly fitting oxygen <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> secured at four points by two head straps. Aviators’ <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> often equipped with “quick don” harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies. Military aviators’ oxygen <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> secured to flight helmets with quick-release systems.|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} {{designed}} to select new rental paintball masks for Gladiator Paintball Park. The currently used rental <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> worn down and need replacement. Criteria for new rental <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> examined and include customer preferences, owner 2 ̆ 7 s constraints, and time studies. Candidate <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> found by asking customers what they like in rental masks, interviewing other paintball field owners, and referring to the online paintball community. Three candidate <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> found, the V-Force Vantage, JT Alpha, and Kingman java paintball <b>masks.</b> These <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> compared to the currently used rental masks, the V-Force Armor. Customers were surveyed {{to find out which}} <b>mask</b> <b>was</b> the safest and most comfortable. Workers were observed cleaning each mask, as the cleaning process is time consuming and costly. A cost analysis was performed to determine which mask had the lowest cost impact. To determine which <b>mask</b> would <b>be</b> the best selection, a weighted criteria equation was used. Based on the weighted criteria, the V-Force Vantage paintball <b>mask</b> <b>was</b> determined to be the best candidate for use at Gladiator Paintball Park and should be purchased immediately...|$|R
5|$|Several {{copies of}} his death mask were made and a replica of one is still held at Moyse's Hall Museum. Artefacts from the trial, {{some of which were}} in Corder's possession, are also held at the museum. Another replica death <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> kept in the dungeons of Norwich Castle. Corder's skin was tanned by surgeon George Creed and used to bind an account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|The Haunted <b>Mask</b> <b>is</b> the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|E
5|$|The final mask to {{be gained}} in the game is the Fierce Deity's Mask. Although {{the use of this}} <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> {{strictly}} limited to boss battles only, it is possible to wear it anywhere using a glitch. Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. His clothes turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it. The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to shoot beams at enemies.|$|E

2500|$|Shigong dance <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> used in shamanic rituals {{to thank}} the gods, while nuo dance masks {{protected}} from bad spirits. Wedding <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> used to pray for good luck and a lasting marriage, and [...] "Swallowing Animal" [...] <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> associated with protecting the home and symbolised the [...] "swallowing" [...] of disaster. Opera <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> used in a basic 'Common' form of opera performed without a stage or backdrops.

50|$|Death <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> {{increasingly}} used by {{scientists from the}} late 18th century onwards to record variations in human physiognomy. The life <b>mask</b> <b>was</b> also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study physiognomic features in famous people and notorious criminals. <b>Masks</b> <b>were</b> also used {{to collect data on}} racial differences.|$|R
5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|Noh {{masks are}} treasured by Noh {{families}} and institution, {{and the powerful}} Noh schools hold {{the oldest and most}} valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely seen by the public. The most ancient <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> {{held to be}} {{of great}} spiritual power, it is {{considered}} a taboo for anyone other than specially trained persons or chosen ones to wear or possess certain masks. These ceremonial <b>masks</b> <b>are</b> each thought to have a soul, or life force, and wearing these <b>masks</b> <b>is</b> thought to transform the wearer into the entity the mask represents.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the realism of Roman portraits may be, {{according}} to some scholars, because they evolved from wax death masks. These death <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> taken from bodies and kept in a home altar. Besides wax, <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> made from bronze, marble and terracotta. The molds for the <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> made directly from the deceased, giving historians an accurate representation of typically Roman features.|$|R
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's <b>Mask</b> <b>is</b> set in Termina, a land {{parallel}} to Hyrule, {{the latter being}} the main setting of most games in the series. According to legend, Termina was split into four areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land. At the center of Termina lies Clock Town, which features a large clock tower that counts down {{the days before the}} Carnival of Time—a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests. Termina Field surrounds Clock Town; beyond lie a swamp, mountain range, bay, and canyon {{in each of the four}} cardinal directions.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
5000|$|After 1902 {{the use of}} <b>masks</b> <b>were</b> largely {{limited to}} mystic {{societies}} or children under 12.

5|$|The character's {{physical}} appearance {{has gone through}} many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character's design, including makeup artist Stan Winston. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis {{for many of the}} later incarnations. The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear until Friday the 13th PartIII. Since , filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television shows, and was the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films. Jason Voorhees's hockey <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> a widely recognized image in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey <b>mask</b> <b>is</b> over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E
