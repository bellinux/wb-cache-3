5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

25|$|Since narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{are usually}} built with smaller radius curves, smaller structure gauges, lighter rails, etc., {{they can be}} substantially less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard gauge or broad gauge railways, particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain. The lower costs of narrow-gauge railways <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify {{the cost of building}} a standard or broad gauge line.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently they will be in a good mood but this does not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.|$|E

500|$|The Blattodea {{include some}} thirty species of {{cockroaches}} associated with humans; these species are atypical {{of the thousands}} of species in the order. They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor. They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals. Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans. One of the proteins that trigger allergic reactions is tropomyosin. These allergens are also linked with asthma. About 60% of asthma patients in Chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens. [...] Studies similar to this have been done globally and all the results are similar. [...] Cockroaches can live for a few days up to a month without food, so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not there. Approximately 20-48% of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dust.|$|E

For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that {{can be interpreted as}} self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them. [...] Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their head in the mirror test.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that iPSCs and ESCs are not equivalent. They have many similar properties, such as pluripotency and differentiation potential, the expression of pluripotency genes, epigenetic patterns, embryoid body and teratoma formation, and viable chimera formation. However, similar does not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the same. In fact, there are many differences within these properties. Importantly, the chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more [...] "closed" [...] or methylated than that of ESCs. Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins. There are thus questions about the [...] "completeness" [...] of reprogramming and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing adult cells to be pluripotent appears to be viable.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2007 it {{had been}} {{announced}} Sebastian would be recording a tribute album of soul classics in Memphis, Tennessee with Stax musicians who played on and wrote some of the original songs. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio. Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis {{in a series of}} blogs for Australian newspapers, [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. I <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mostly in their late 60s and have such a wealth of experience." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. [...] he just took us by storm." [...] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008. The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year. The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008. The Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs. AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.|$|E
