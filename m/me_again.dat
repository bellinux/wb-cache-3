5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill <b>Me</b> <b>Again</b> (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as he lay on the ground: [...] "And don't ever stand over <b>me</b> <b>again</b> sneering about fake injuries, and tell your pal Wetherall there's some for him as well."

500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> but I have got to take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape.

500|$|Trotter {{continued}} his protests, eventually gaining a second {{invitation to the}} White House in November 1914. This meeting with Wilson ended with a heated exchange between the two men. [...] Wilson claimed {{to be dealing with}} a [...] "human problem" [...] from which politics should be left out, and suggested to Trotter's group that they could always vote for someone else in the next election. Trotter continued to argue that the segregationist policy was humiliating to African Americans. Wilson responded, [...] "If you take it as a humiliation, which it is not intended as, and sow the seed of that impression all over the country, why the consequences will be very serious." [...] After Trotter said this was an insult, Wilson angrily ordered him to leave, saying [...] "If this organization wishes to approach <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> it must choose another spokesman... your tone, sir, offends me." ...|$|E

500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked as an antidote to Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach <b>Me</b> <b>again.</b> After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E

500|$|Winrich Kolbe, the {{director}} of [...] "Caretaker", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans {{who were in the}} Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the [...] "Caretaker" [...] script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience, [...] "I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part. They asked to see <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|A player's {{baseball}} statistics {{can increase}} or reduce the leverage which {{he may have}} in future contract negotiations. Many players also have monetary incentives written in their contracts {{which are based on}} statistical measurements, and official scorers have the option to reverse a scoring decision within 24 hours of the conclusion of a game. Because of this, baseball writer-scorers were often subject to pressure from the players they were covering in their newspaper. After a game in 1962, infielder Jerry Adair asked for a meeting with local writer Neal Eskridge after learning that he was the scorer for the game. Angry about an error he had received in the game, Jerry [...] "cursed [...] thoroughly and imaginatively, and told him, 'Never talk to <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> They reportedly did not speak to each other for almost four years. In the early days of baseball, a disagreement over a scoring decision occasionally led to physical altercations between the player and the writer. Confrontational incidents decreased after 1974 following a warning from MLB.|$|E

So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it."
