40|$|The title compound, C 10 H 12 N 2 O 2, was {{prepared}} by the reaction of <b>methyl</b> <b>carbazate</b> and 4 -methylbenzaldehyde. The dihedral angle between the benzene ring and the carbazate fragment is 20. 86 &# 8197;(10) &# 176;. In the crystal structure, molecules are linked by intermolecular N&# 8212;H [...] .

40|$|Divalent metal {{complexes}} {{of general}} formula M(2 -nb) (2) (mc) (2) ]. 2 (2 -nbH), where M = Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) or Zn(II), 2 -nbH = 2 -nitrobenzoic acid and mc = <b>methyl</b> <b>carbazate</b> (NH 2 NHCOOCH 3), {{have been prepared}} and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Single-crystal X-ray study of the Cu(II) complex revealed that the molecule is centrosymmetric, with two N,O-chelating mc ligands in equatorial positions {{and a pair of}} monodentate 2 -nb anions in the axial positions. The lattice 2 -nbH molecules help to establish the packing of monomers through hydrogen-bonding interactions. Thermal stability and reactivity of the complexes were studied by TG-DTA. Emission studies show that these complexes are fluorescent...|$|E
40|$|A new {{coordination}} complex, [Zn(MCZ) 3](NO 3) 2 ·H 2 O, was synthesized by {{the reaction}} of the aqueous solutions of zinc(II) nitrate and <b>methyl</b> <b>carbazate.</b> The complex was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and X-ray diffraction. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 (1) /n. The central metal ion has distorted octahedral six-coordination environment, and is coordinated to bidentate MCZ ligands through carbonyl oxygen atoms and the terminal nitrogen atoms. [Zn(MCZ) 3] 2 + cations, NO 3 - anions and lattice water molecules are interconnected by electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds into a 3 -D network. The thermal decomposition mechanism was suggested by DSC and TG-DTG studies under the linear heating rates. [Zn(MCZ) 3](NO 3) 2 ·H 2 O begins to decompose at 181. 9 °C, and the final solid residue at 300 °C is ZnO...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermolysis}} of 2 -diphenylmethylenehydrazono- 5, 5 -dimethyl. A 3 - 1, 3, 4 _oxadiazoline in {{vacuum and}} in chlorobenzene was studied. In both cases a stable 1 -(diphenylmethylene) - 4, 4 -dimethyl- 3 -oxo 1, 2 -diazetidinium inner salt was obtained {{as the major}} product. The corresponding imino-oxirane, an isomer of the diazetidinium inner salt, {{is believed to be}} a precursor of the above product. Thermolysis of the same oxadiazoline in methanol gave benzophenone <b>methyl</b> <b>carbazate</b> and methyl isopropyl ether, probably involving the initial formation of an isocyanate as an intermediate. ii ACKNCMI.
