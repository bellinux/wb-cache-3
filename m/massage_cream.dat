40|$|Essential oils of lavender, sweet marjoram, {{patchouli}} and vetiver were {{blended into}} an aqueous cream (content of essential oil blend = 3. 5 ml/ 100 g aqueous cream) and 5 g was gently massaged five times/day onto {{the bodies and}} limbs of 56 aged care facility residents (age range 70 - 92 years) with moderate to severe dementia. Participants {{were divided into two}} groups and following a baseline period in which there was first no massage at all, followed by <b>massage</b> with <b>cream</b> only, the groups received 4 weeks of <b>massage</b> with <b>cream</b> and essential oils or 4 weeks of <b>massage</b> with <b>cream</b> alone, and then received the other treatment for 4 weeks. Full data sets over the trial period were available for 36 participants. During the period of oil application, both groups showed a significant decrease in the average frequency and severity of dementia-related behaviours occurring at times other than during nursing care, compared to during the baseline and the 'no oil' periods. Resistance to nursing care procedures increased, however, for participants in one of the groups during the essential oil application period, which may reflect increased mental alertness and awareness caused by the oils. A possible increase in mental alertness and cognitive function was also suggested by a small but significant improvement in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores after the essential oil treatment period for the seven residents who scored above 0 on the MMSE. 8 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the body}} is rewashed and dried, a {{moisturizing}} cream {{is applied to the}} body. The body will usually sit {{for as long as possible}} for observation by the embalmer. After being dressed for visitation or funeral services, cosmetics are applied to make the body appear more lifelike and to create a [...] "memory picture" [...] for the deceased's friends and relatives. For babies who have died, the embalmer may apply a light cosmetic <b>massage</b> <b>cream</b> after embalming to provide a natural appearance; <b>massage</b> <b>cream</b> is also used on the face to prevent them from dehydrating, and the infant's mouth is often kept slightly open for a more natural expression. If possible, the funeral director uses a light, translucent cosmetic; sometimes, heavier, opaque cosmetics are used to hide bruises, cuts, or discolored areas. Makeup is applied to the lips to mimic their natural color. Sometimes a very pale or light pink lipstick is applied on males, while brighter colored lipstick is applied to females. Hair gels or baby oil is applied to style short hair; while hairspray is applied to style longer hair. Powders (especially baby powder) are applied to the body to eliminate odors, and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent oiliness of the corpse. Mortuary cosmetizing is not done for the same reason as make-up for living people; rather, it is designed to add depth and dimension to a person's features that lack of blood circulation has removed. Warm areas - where blood vessels in living people are superficial, such as the cheeks, chin, and knuckles - have subtle reds added to recreate this effect, while browns are added to the palpabrae (eyelids) to add depth, especially important as viewing in a coffin creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life. During the viewing, pink-colored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceased's complexion.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{efficacy}} of rubbing a glucosamine sulfate containing <b>massage</b> <b>cream</b> {{as a treatment}} for pain due to knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: Eighty patients were randomized to receive treatment by either a Glucosamine Sulfate menthol based rubbing compound or placebo. Patients were required to use the cream at least three times daily over a six-week period. Efficacy was assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Knee Society Score (KSS). RESULTS: As significant we considered a 20 percent reduction in VAS scores at six weeks following initiation of treatment. 33 of 40 patients in the treatment group improved significantly as compared to 12 of 40 in the placebo group. This difference appears significant when categorized as a categorical parameter (p < 0. 01). An improvement of 5 points in the KSS score was considered significant. 21 of 40 patients in the treatment group improved significantly as compared to 5 of 40 in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a possible positive effect of a Glucosamine Sulfate containing rubbing compound on knee pain due to osteoarthritis, within an six-week treatment period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} the aroma foot spa on the stress, 12 university students with stress were divided into control group (6 subjects) and aroma foot spa group (6 subjects). Control group was not subjected to any kind of intervention while aroma foot spa group was subjected to 10 minutes of foot bath using 5 % Juniper, lavender and lemon essential oil and 10 minutes of foot massage using <b>massage</b> <b>cream</b> during four weeks, two times per week. As for the evaluation method, brain wave was studied to measure the amount of change in stress. After measuring the change in the brain wave before and after the experiment, it was proven that the aroma foot spa groupâ€™s Alpha wave (Z=- 2. 364, p<. 05) and SMR wave (Z=- 1. 981, p<. 05) were higher than those of the control group. Moreover, when the pre and post experiment results of the aroma foot spa group were measured, it was proven that the Theta wave (Z=- 2. 366, p<. 05) decreased while Alpha wave (Z=- 2. 371, p<. 05) increased. In other words, aroma foot spa that included foot bath using essential oil and foot massage increased Alpha wave which in turn influenced the brain wave due to increased blood circulation resulting from muscle relaxation. Moreover, SMR wave increase was closely related to the change in Alpha wave, which demonstrates that SMR wave increased due to stress alleviation...|$|E

30|$|The {{classification}} and labelling {{of personal}} care products was derived by application of the criteria given in the CLP Regulation. Bridging principles were not relevant as no information about comparable cosmetic products tested and classified as mixtures was available. 41 cosmetic products were selected {{from a wide range}} of product groups (e.g. [27, 28]): baby skin product (2), after shave (2), shaving cream, deodorant (4), toothpaste (2), shampoo (2), hand and body lotion, shower gel, liquid soap and syndet, eye zone <b>cream,</b> <b>massage</b> oil, carotene skincare gel, all purpose cream, basic cream, hand cream, emulsion with panthenol, massage oil, hair spray (2), oxidative hair dye formula, bleaching lotion, depilatory cream, cold wave solution, mascara (2), lipstick (2), face make up remover, nail glue, perfume, alcohol free cologne, insect repellent (2). The number of ingredients ranged from 41 (perfume) to a single one (nail glue). The formulas are basic recipes for standard products and correspond to lists of ingredients of products in German retail shops and cosmetic frame formulations [8]. The present selection of products is meant to illustrate the situation with some examples and it is not meant to be complete nor representative. The information on properties necessary for {{classification and labelling}} of all ingredients were compiled from data accessible to the general public. Preferentially harmonized classifications were used in the current C&L Inventory [9]. The classifications of substances registered according to REACH were compared with the classifications in the C&L Inventory. Most substances which are used more or less exclusively in cosmetics have not been registered according to REACH, whereas cosmetic ingredients used also in other applications like e.g. glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, isododecane, isopropanol, or phosphoric acid are registered. The recently installed cosmetic products notification portal according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [6] is not open for the general public and could not be used. The names used here are the INCI names [29].|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The skin is {{the largest}} area {{of the body that}} {{interfaces}} with bacteria and "problems" from the environment and is the first line of defence for the body. There are, of course, immune system functions that take place within the skin area and it would be nourished only by the very small arteries (capillaries). So the blood supply at the surface of the skin is not as great as it is further inside the body. When you can apply something on the skin, which nourishes the immune system cells, such as MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) and urea you are doing wonders in improving the health of the skin. The use of urea in dermatological therapy and cosmetics has become more and more important in recent years. However, urea is unstable in formulations, decomposing into carbon dioxide and ammonia. Products containing urea can be stabilised by including MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) in the formulation (Herschler, 1981 :l). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the stabilising effect of MSM on urea in cosmetic products. Cosmetic products that were formulated with MSM and urea as actives, comprised of a moisturising lotion, <b>massage</b> <b>cream,</b> foot and heel balm, hair gel, hair spray and lip ice. The formulations were subjected to stability studies for three months under ICH conditions. The formulated products were stored at 5 ÂºC, 25 ÂºC/ 60 %RH and 4 OÂºC/ 75 %RH. The strength of MSM and urea in each formulation was 5 % m/m, except for the hair spray and lip ice where the concentrations were 10 % m/m and 2. 5 % m/m respectively. HPLC analysis was used to determine the urea concentrations in all the formulated products, as well as the concentration released during membrane release studies. GC analysis was used to determine the MSM concentrations in the products. Other stability tests included appearance, spreadability, pH, relative density, penetration, viscosity, preservative content and preservative efficacy. Chapter 1 gives a literature overview of the uses and importance of cosmetics. Chapter 2 is a literature overview of the skin and the properties and uses of urea and MSM. Chapter 3 deals with the formulation of urea and MSM products and the chemicals that have been used. Chapter 4 described the methods used for accelerated stability testing. Chapter 5 - 10 finally deals with the results obtained and the conclusions that were made. The test results showed the following: There was a prominent change in the pH of all the formulated products; this can be due to decomposition of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia (Beiersdorf, 2003 : 1). Higher temperature and moisture increase this decomposition and cause the pH to increase to values as high as 11 (Anon, 2003 : 20). The viscosity, spreadability, penetration, relative density and appearance of the products remained more or less the same over three months, except for the hair spray where crystals formed in the product that was stored at 5 ÂºC for 1 month due to the menthol in the formulation. The urea and MSM content decreased with time. The lip ice formulation showed concentrations as low as 30 % due to poor solubility of the urea and MSM crystals in the waxes of the lip ice formulation. HPLC analysis of the preservatives confirmed their stability in the formulated products. The preservative efficacy results proved that the products were sufficiently protected from microbial contamination. The release study indicated that urea is released at a steady rate from the preparations tested. Urea was released from the moisturising lotion after 120 minutes. In general, the release is influenced by the viscosity of the medium and should be faster from the gel than from the creams or lotion (Shah et al., 199155). In conclusion it can be said that urea and MSM were successfully formulated into the six cosmetic products except for the lip ice, which showed low, unstable concentrations of the actives due to poor solubility of the actives in the waxes of the lip ice formulation. By comparing the results of Claasen, (2003 : 63) and the results obtained in this study for the hair gel and foot and heel balm, it looks as if MSM had a stabilising effect on urea, by lowering the decrease of urea concentrations over time.
