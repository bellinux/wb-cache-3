2500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England on 1 January 1941. His mother was a teacher. His father {{maintained}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>workshop</b> and taught Evans to use tools and machines including a lathe. Evans was close to his grandfather who was a choir master at a Baptist Church for over 40 years, and whose main interests were music, poetry, and the Baptist Church. His mother's brother was a professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge. As a boy Evans was quiet, shy and inquisitive. He liked science, and his parents encouraged his education. He remembers loving old science books and receiving an electric experimental set which he wanted for Christmas. He attributes to a chemistry set, from which he learned basic chemistry, {{for the development of}} one of his [...] "greatest amateur passions". He went to middle school at St Dunstan's College, an independent school for boys in South East London, where he started chemistry and physics classes, and studied biology. He worked hard studying for the University of Cambridge entrance exams. At school {{he was one of the}} best pupils, although not at the top of the class.|$|E
