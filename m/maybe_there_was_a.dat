500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don’t know why. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half}} of 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E
60|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> murmur in {{the village}} streets, a novel and {{dominant}} topic in the public-houses, and {{here and there a}} messenger, or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; {{but for the most part}} the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed in the sky.

It appeared to them that several of his acts were distinctly tyrannical, and were encroachments upon rights of theirs which the other teacher, with all his severity, had respected. My boy was inspired by the common mood to write a tragedy which had the despotic behavior of the new teacher for its subject, and which was intended to be represented by the boys in the hayloft of a boy whose father had a stable without any horse in it. The tragedy was written in the measure of the [...] "Lady of the Lake," [...] which was the last poem my boy had heard his father reading aloud; it was very easy kind of verse. At the same time, the boys were to be dressed as Roman conspirators, {{and one of them was}} to give the teacher a petition to read, while another plunged a dagger into his vitals, and still another shouted, [...] "Strike, Stephanos, strike!"

60|$|It {{was over}} at last, and {{the hall of}} justice broke up. Mary Morris was at once in her mother's arms, {{and in a few}} minutes more making up for all past privations by a {{substantial}} meal in the kitchen. But Mrs. Kelland had gone to Avoncester to purchase thread, and only her daughter Susan had come up, the girl {{who was supposed to be}} a sort of spider, with no capacities beyond her web. Nor did Rachel think Lovedy capable of walking down to Mackarel Lane, nor well enough for the comfortless chairs and the third part of a bed. No, Mr. Grey's words that Rachel was accountable for the children's sufferings had gone to her heart. Pity was there and indignation, but these had brought such an anguish of self-accusation as she could only appease by lavishing personal care upon the chief sufferer. She carried the child to her own sitting-room and made a couch for her before the fire, sending Susan away with the assurance that Lovedy should stay at the Homestead, and be nursed and fed till she was well and strong again. Fanny, who had accompanied her, thought the child very ill, and was urgent that the doctor should be sent for; but between Rachel and the faculty of Avonmouth there was a deadly feud, and the proposal was scouted. Hunger and a bad cold were easily treated, and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> spark of consolation in having a patient all to herself and her homoeopathic book.|$|E

In it, Fleming {{is about to}} record an {{interview}} with Chuck when Bryce enters and reveals that Chuck never got the message. Fleming says that Chuck is ideal for the Omaha Project, and touts his high rate of retention of subliminal information; he further states that, because of the promise Chuck shows, Chuck will be drafted rather than recruited {{and he will be}} [...] "in, no matter what." [...] Bryce fears that Omaha, a military project, would destroy his friend and that he's too good a person to be forced into that life. With no other options, Bryce requests that Fleming help him falsify records to show Chuck cheated on his exams, invalidating his test scores and sparing him from recruitment. Chuck realizes Bryce sacrificed his friendship with Chuck to save him, and that, if Bryce got him expelled to protect him, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reason for him destroying the Intersect as well. (And Sarah notes that <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reason he sent the Intersect to Chuck).|$|E

50|$|Although the Romans conquered Tweeddale, they do {{not appear}} to have settled it and there are no great Roman roads or {{buildings}} in the area. Vestiges of Roman camps exist near Lyne Church, west of Peebles, and at Innerleithen. On Tower Knowe there are the remains of what is thought to be the Roman road that led from Newstead to Peebles. This would tie in with the Roman Camp outside Innerleithen and there might be some connection with the terraces on Purvis Hill. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> settlement of Romanised Britons around the Walker Burn or at least local people who settled and farmed perhaps to feed the legionaries in the camp at Innerleithen. The terraces themselves are something of a mystery. It is not really certain whether they were cultivation terraces or built as a form of theatre seating up the hillside. There has never been an excavation in this area so {{little is known about the}} people who built the terraces, whether from Roman times or Anglo Saxons. Towards Galashiels, at Kill Brae, there are more terraces and signs of an old settlement.|$|E

METHODS: The clinical data and blood samples of the ADCC family were collected. Microsatellite markers were chosen according to 24 known candidate genes of ADCC. Lod scores of microsatellite markers were calculated with Mlink package of linkage software. RESULTS: The phenotype of this family was nuclear cataract. After linkage analyzing,Lod scores of 50 microsatellite markers were less than zero. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no linkage between the microsatellite markers and this pedigree. CONCLUSION: The related gene of this family is not among the known genes of ADCC <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new pathogenic gene in this pedigree...|$|R

His father had studied mechanical engineering before being forced to give up his formal education to assist his widowed mother at the Public House. However, Professor Phillips cannot recall ever having had a serious scientific discussion with either of his parents. His early interest in physics was thrust upon him by his primary school teachers, who recognized his talents from his marks on standardized tests he took at the conclusion of his grammar school years. His course being set, he did not disappoint. Tom worked hard in secondary school, rapidly catching up with colleagues who had a more supportive career start.

40|$|Introduction: According {{to several}} reports, 20 – 30 % of severe {{hemophilia}} A and 1 – 3 % of severe hemophilia B patients develop inhibitors. The control of bleeding through bypassing agent is {{the management of}} these patients. This study reports prevalence of high titer inhibitor (> 5 BU) in these patients and their management in Golestan, Iran. Methods: It was studied all of patients with hemophilia A and B from our center. Inhibitor was tested {{for all of them}} and cases with inhibitor > 5 BU were managed through bypassing agents. Results: There were 78 patients (65 hemophilia A and 13 hemophilia B). Three cases (4. 6 %) of hemophilia A and 3 cases (23. 7 %) of hemophilia B patients had Inhibitor > 5 BU. For these cases, the mean of age was 24 ± 7. 87 and 15. 67 ± 4. 11 for hemophilia A and B, respectively. The better managements were NovoSeven and FEIBA for hemophilia A and B cases, respectively. Discussion/Conclusion: Prevalence of inhibitor of hemophilia A and B in this study was against other studies that maybe it was because of differences in disease severity, race/ethnicity, age, factor exposure as well as genetic of disease. Also, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relationship between response to management and type of disease. It is recommended these findings are studied in a larger sample size...|$|E

We demonstrate how three dimensional visualization can link together formerly disparately treated topics, cultivate the central mathematical ideas of lifting and projecting, and foster the habit of exploring new points of view.
