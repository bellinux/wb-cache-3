5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> cocaine.

In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, <b>marijuana,</b> <b>and</b> crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E

5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing <b>marijuana,</b> <b>and,</b> in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off <b>marijuana,</b> <b>and</b> vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis.

5|$|In 1995, Oregon House Bill 3466, {{which would}} have recriminalized {{marijuana}} in Oregon, died. According to bill sponsor Jerry Grisham (R–Beavercreek), HB 3466 was meant to counter a circulating initiative petition called The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act of 1997, {{which would have}} allowed state liquor stores to sell <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> permitted hemp production for paper, fabric, oil, and protein. Taxes on these products would go to schools to replace funding allegedly lost by Measure 5.

Use of tobacco or <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> consumption of pork were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.|$|E
5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of <b>marijuana,</b> <b>and</b> was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E
40|$|Marijuana {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used drugs in the United States, and the {{consequences}} of its use are mostly unknown. As <b>marijuana</b> becomes legalized <b>and</b> more widely available, it is important to investigate possible cognitive and mental health consequences of its use. The present study examined the associations between childhood internalizing behavior, adolescent <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> early adulthood depression. A twin study was conducted to examine two alternative hypotheses regarding the association between adolescent <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> early adulthood depression: 1. the association between <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> depression is due to common genes or shared environmental influences, 2. after controlling for genetics and environmental factors on early internalizing behavior, the non-shared environmental factors that lead to marijuana use also lead to depression in adulthood (i. e., result more consistent with the causal hypothesis). There was a positive, statistically significant correlation between adolescent <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> early adulthood depression, which was mostly explained by common shared environmental influences. There was little evidence that marijuana use has a causal influence on depression...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the mediating role of implicit cognitive {{processes in the}} prediction of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> examined the relationships between dissociative experiences, implicit processes, and sensation seeking in models of drug use and problem experiences. Participants were 467 diverse at-risk adolescents in California. Results from latent variable models revealed that implicit cognition independently predicted alcohol <b>and</b> <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> mediated the predictive effects of sensation seeking on drug use. Dissociative experiences did not predict implicit cognition or drug use in this sample, though this factor {{was a significant predictor}} of problem experiences and was positively correlated with sensation seeking. This research provides further evidence suggesting that implicit, associative memory processes are influential in drug-use motivation...|$|R
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E

Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> been drinking on the night. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions as being legal under Hawaii law. Supporters in Australiaincluding future Prime Minister Bob Hawkelaunched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio. They gathered thousands of signatures to no avail.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking <b>marijuana</b> <b>and</b> heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} the longitudinal associations of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> violence over ages 11 - 20 in the youngest sample of males from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (N = 503). We examined trends in alcohol <b>and</b> <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> violence, how they covaried both concurrently and over time, and whether frequent substance use predicted violence {{and vice versa}} in multivariate models controlling for common risk factors. The analyses focused on frequent alco-hol or marijuana users, those who scored in the highest 25 % of frequency. Throughout adoles-cence, substance use was more prevalent than violence. Most substance users did not engage in violence, {{and the proportion of}} substance users who engaged in violence was smaller than the proportion of violent offenders who were also substance users. Concurrently, frequent use of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>marijuana</b> were both significantly associated with violence. Longitudinal associa-tions between frequent drinking and violence were weak, whereas longitudinal associations between frequent <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> violence were more consistent. However, the relationship between frequent <b>marijuana</b> use <b>and</b> violence (and vice versa) was spurious; it was no longer sig-nificant when common risk factors such as race/ethnicity and hard drug use were controlled for. We conclude that the marijuana-violence relationship is due to selection effects whereby these behaviors tend to co-occur in certain individuals, not because one behavior causes the other; rather, both are influenced by shared risk factors and/or an underlying tendency toward deviance...|$|R
