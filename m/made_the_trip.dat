5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans who had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to Cardiff, but were immediately aware {{that something was}} not right on the touchline, although {{with the level of}} commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{designers}} {{fashion a}} look for host Heidi Klum {{to wear to}} the Emmys. When Heidi and Tim <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> around <b>the</b> workroom, Heidi was not satisfied. Heidi then allowed the designers to go to Mood to buy more fabric to revamp or redo their garments.|$|R
50|$|From February to September 1917, {{the steam}} yacht Managem {{regularly}} sailed to the Palestinian shore near Atlit. Lishansky swam ashore to collect Nili {{information and to}} pass money sent by American Jews to the starving yishuv. However, the presence of German submarines <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> too risky and the group switched to homing pigeons.|$|R
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} to key players {{ahead of the}} tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon. In addition, his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on ahead of the tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following {{the intervention of}} newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although {{he had yet to}} be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. Alais <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|In May 1840, Etty finally <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to Brussels and Antwerp {{which he}} had been forced by {{revolution}} to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen for a longer visit to visit St. Rumbold's Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist habit; he also bought a Capuchin habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|In November 1982, {{three years}} before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609km (1.000mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race {{with a time of}} 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He {{finished}} 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 AGP winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.|$|E
60|$|He {{immediately}} signalled to {{the cruiser}} to send water, medicine, and provisions, and another boat <b>made</b> <b>the</b> perilous <b>trip</b> to <b>the</b> Arrow.|$|R

5|$|Like Borussia, Feyenoord faced {{opposition}} {{from the city of}} Milan in the semi-finals, in the shape of Internazionale. Around 10,000 Feyenoord fans <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to the scene of Feyenoord’s 1970 European Cup victory for the first leg. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0 to gain a vital away goal after Iván Córdoba scored an own goal. The second leg started well for Feyenoord after going 2–0 up inside 34 minutes, due to goals from Van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson, to put Feyenoord 3–0 up on aggregate. Inter came back into the tie in the last minutes when they pulled two goals back through Javier Zanetti and Mohamed Kallon, but Feyenoord secured their place in the final with a 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the fence, the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of {{supplies}} in 3,000 trucks with a net loss of 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E
5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
50|$|Travelers rarely <b>made</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>trip</b> {{without one}} or more in their {{traveling}} group dying. According to an evaluation by Trail Authority John Unruh, a 4% death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail while making <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Burnley <b>made</b> <b>the</b> short <b>trip</b> to Bloomfield Road {{the very}} next day, and they {{returned}} to East Lancashire with a defeat. Anderton and Anderson netted Blackpool's goals in their 2-1 win.|$|R
50|$|Blackpool <b>made</b> <b>the</b> short <b>trip</b> to East Lancashire the {{following}} week to take on Burnley. Cookson scored his third of the season as the honours were shared in a 1-1 draw.|$|R
5|$|The Giants {{travelled}} to Massachusetts to {{face the}} New England Patriots at Foxboro Stadium in Week 17. The game was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The game had no playoff implications for the Giants, who could not surpass the 49ers for the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Giants rushed for a season-high 213yards, led by Hostetler's 82yards on 10 carries. The Patriots' Jason Staurovsky missed a potential game-tying 42-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, and Hostetler then ran a 30-yard bootleg on a key third-down play to allow the Giants to run out the clock and secure the victory, 13–10.|$|E
5|$|To {{secure a}} first round bye, the Giants needed to beat {{two of the}} NFL's worst teams, the Phoenix Cardinals and New England Patriots on the road. The Giants won the Cardiinals game 24–21. Their game against the Patriots was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The Patriots, who came in 1-14 and on a 13-game losing streak in a scandal-plagued season, played the Giants better than expected, but missed a field goal that proved the {{difference}} as the Giants held on for a 13-10 win. The win secured a 13-3 record, and the playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. The team discipline Parcells installed was exemplified by the Giants setting the record for fewest turnovers in a season with 14 (this is still the NFL record as of 2007).|$|E
5|$|A left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket {{debut in the}} 1945–46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early-1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular {{member of the national}} team and played in every Test over the next two summers, fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947–48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> after a 3–2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a more optimistic outlook; this allowed him to tour. As a member of Bradman's Invincibles, the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted a friend with the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed Toshak. The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.|$|E
50|$|On 4 January, Southampton <b>made</b> <b>the</b> long <b>trip</b> to Bloomfield Road. Blackpool won 5-1, {{courtesy}} of a Hampsons hat-trick of hat-tricks for the season and one each from Tremelling and Ritchie.|$|R

5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E
