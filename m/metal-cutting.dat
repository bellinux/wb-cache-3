500|$|Due to a {{significant}} wealthy East Asian clientele of gamblers which the casino attracts, it is a restaurant with Chinese chefs serving authentic Chinese cuisine. The bright and luminous interior contains no direct lighting; rather, an overhead <b>metal-cut</b> white screen and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all backlit by LED bulbs. Halogen track lighting spotlights each table. The lighting system won a commendation from Architectural Lighting magazine in its 2009 AL Design Awards. The authors of Eating Las Vegas 2012 wrote: [...] "Combining classic Chinese peasant and street food with a super-cool design, the place looks like it's been draped in a gigantic white, transparent metal doily, and is meant to resemble either inverted Chinese lace cut into an arabesque pattern or the inside of an inverted bird's nest – all very symbolic and all very Chinese. The food is fabulous, especially the Imperial seafood-soup dumplings (which everyone comes for) and the Chef's Special beef pancake".|$|R

50|$|An {{alligator}} shear, historically {{known as}} a lever shear and sometimes as a crocodile shear, is a <b>metal-cutting</b> shear with a hinged jaw, powered by a flywheel or hydraulic cylinder. Alligator shears are generally set up as stand-alone shears; however, there are types for excavators. The jaw size can range from 4 to 36 in long. They are generally used to cut steel members, such as rebar, pipe, angle iron, or I-beams.|$|E
50|$|Notching is a <b>metal-cutting</b> process used on {{sheetmetal}} or thin barstock, {{sometimes on}} angle sections or tube. A shearing or punching process {{is used in}} a press, so as to cut vertically down and perpendicular to the surface, working {{from the edge of}} a workpiece. Sometimes the goal is merely the notch itself, but usually this is a precursor to some other process: such as bending a corner in sheet or joining two tubes at a tee joint, notching one to fit closely to the other.|$|E

50|$|Yefim Alekseyevich Cherepanov (1774-1842), {{and his son}} Miron Yefimovich Cherepanov (1803-1849) were Russian inventors and {{industrial}} engineers. They were serfs of the Demidovs - a famous family of factory owners. In 1810s, Yefim built a progressive machine-building plant, equipped with {{a full range of}} innovative <b>metal-cutting</b> lathes (such as screw-cutters, gear-cutting serrating machines and others). From 1822 until his death, Yefim was chief mechanic for all the factories in the town of Nizhny Tagil. Miron was his apprentice and in 1819 was appointed his deputy. Miron became chief mechanic his father's death.|$|E
5000|$|Grinding is {{a subset}} of cutting, as {{grinding}} is a true <b>metal-cutting</b> process. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle), and shears a tiny chip that is analogous to what would conventionally be called a [...] "cut" [...] chip (turning, milling, drilling, tapping, etc.) [...] However, among {{people who work in}} the machining fields, the term cutting is often understood to refer to the macroscopic cutting operations, and grinding is often mentally categorized as a [...] "separate" [...] process. This is why the terms are usually used in separately in shop-floor practice.|$|E
50|$|Cutting tool {{materials}} must {{be harder}} than the material {{which is to be}} cut, and the tool must be able to withstand the heat generated in the <b>metal-cutting</b> process. Also, the tool must have a specific geometry, with clearance angles designed so that the cutting edge can contact the workpiece without the rest of the tool dragging on the workpiece surface. The angle of the cutting face is also important, as is the flute width, number of flutes or teeth, and margin size. In order to have a long working life, all of the above must be optimized, plus the speeds and feeds at which the tool is run.|$|E
5000|$|In a mass {{production}} environment, or in a well equipped private shop, the blanking process {{is used to}} make [...] "blade blanks." [...] This {{can be achieved by}} a number of different methods, depending upon the thickness of the material and the alloy content of steel to be cut. Thinner cross section, lower alloy blanks can be stamped from sheet material. Materials that are more difficult to work with, or jobs that require higher production volume, can be accomplished with water jet cutters, lasers or electron beam cutting. These two lend themselves towards larger custom shops. Some custom knife makers cut their blanks from steel using a <b>metal-cutting</b> bandsaw.|$|E
50|$|Hall's {{methods were}} novel for the time. Hall {{transferred}} water power through {{a system of}} leather belts and pulleys to power his machines with unusual pace, greater than 3,000 revolutions per minute with efficiency, while most artisans used hand cutters and files. Like his contemporary Simeon North, Hall began using this mill power to run machine tools and achieve the dimension controls necessary for interchangeable parts. He employed <b>metal-cutting</b> machines attached with cutters and saws {{in the place of}} the standard heavy labor, made from cast-iron frames to ensure structural integrity and minimize vibrations from the mill’s belts. These machine-cut surfaces would then be hand filed to ensure fit and interchangeability, verified by a gauging system Hall had designed.|$|E
50|$|Between 2001 and 2005, the {{national}} economy demonstrated steady and dynamic growth. The GDP grew at an average rate of 7.4 percent, peaking in 2005 at 9.2 percent. This growth was mainly {{a result of the}} performance of the industrial sector, which grew on average more than 8.7 percent per year, with a high of 10.4 percent in 2005. Potatoes, flax, hemp, sugarbeets, rye, oats, and wheat are the chief agricultural products. Dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and chickens are raised. Belarus has only small reserves of petroleum and natural gas and imports most of its oil and gas from Russia. The main branches of industry produce tractors and trucks, earth movers for use in construction and mining, <b>metal-cutting</b> machine tools, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, chemicals, fertilizer, textiles, and consumer goods. The chief trading partners are Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Germany.|$|E
50|$|North Korea {{claims to}} have {{fulfilled}} the Second Seven-Year Plan (1978-84) target of raising the industrial output in 1984 to 120% of the 1977 target, equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 12.2%. Judging from the production of major commodities that form {{the greater part of}} industrial output, however, it is unlikely that this happened. For example, the increase during the 1978-84 plan period for electric power, coal, steel, <b>metal-cutting</b> machines, tractors, passenger cars, chemical fertilizers, chemical fibers, cement, and textiles, respectively, was 78%, 50%, 85%, 67%, 50%, 20%, 56%, 80%, 78%, and 45%.Raw materials were in short supply and so were energy and hard currency. Infrastructure decayed and machinery became obsolete. Unlike other socialist countries in the Eastern Europe, North Korea kept planning in a highly centralized manner and refused to liberalize economic management.|$|E
50|$|Korea Tungsten Company (KTC, Korean: 대한중석, {{pronounced}} daehan jungsuk, Hanja: 大韓重石) {{was a major}} South Korean {{manufacturer of}} tungsten cutting tools, tungsten powder, and related <b>metal-cutting</b> products. It was the 28th-largest chaebol by asset with subsidiaries such as Korea Tungsten Construction and Korea Sintered Metal. With the national government, KTC also established POSCO, which is now the world's second largest steelmaker by output. In 1998, Keo-Pyung, then KTC's proprietor, defaulted on its loans and was declared bankrupt by its main creditor, CHB Bank. On May 12, 1998, Keo-Pyung {{announced that it would}} shed 14 of its 19 companies, Korea Tungsten among them. ISCAR, the predecessor and now the largest arm of IMC, bought KTC after months of negotiations, and renamed it TaeguTec.

5000|$|Donbass is {{dominated}} by heavy industry, such as coal mining and metallurgy. While annual extraction of coal has decreased since the 1970s, Donbass remains an important supplier. Coal mining in Donbass is conducted at very deep depths. Lignite mining takes place at around 600 m below the surface, whilst mining for more valuable anthracite and bituminous coal takes place at depths of around 1800 m. Prior {{to the start of}} the region's war in April 2014, Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts together produced about 30 percent of Ukraine's exports. [...] Other industries in Donetsk which may overlap Donbass include blast-furnace and steel-making equipment, railway freight cars, <b>metal-cutting</b> machine-tools, tunneling machines, agricultural harvesters and ploughing systems, railway tracks, mining cars, electric locomotives, military vehicles, tractors and excavators. The region also produces consumer goods like household washing-machines, refrigerators, freezers, TV sets, leather footwear, and toilet soap. Over half its production is exported, and about 22% is exported to Russia.|$|E
50|$|A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, {{originally}} and principally {{made for}} cutting metal. They can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them. There are hand saw versions and powered versions (power hacksaws). Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped frame that holds a blade under tension. Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames {{may also be}} adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin blade under tension. Panel hacksaws forgo the frame and instead have a sheet metal body; they can cut into a sheet metal panel further than a frame would allow. These saws are no longer commonly available, but hacksaw blade holders enable standard hacksaw blades to be used similarly to a keyhole saw or pad saw. Power tools including nibblers, jigsaws, and angle grinders fitted with <b>metal-cutting</b> blades and discs are now used for longer cuts in sheet metals.|$|E
