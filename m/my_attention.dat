5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
25|$|He {{would point}} out the elegant {{movement}} of the birds, and the beauty and softness of their plumage. He called <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to their show of pleasure or sense of danger, their perfect forms and splendid attire. He would speak of their departure and return with the seasons.|$|E
60|$|I was irritated and disquieted. I {{had been}} very earnest in <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> to Mother Anastasia. Perhaps this lady had seen me attempt to kiss her hand. I must set myself right.|$|R
6000|$|... "But do {{you know}} who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion? Do you know that I pay <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> to her, and have for some time? Just be careful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{thought that}} I'd show Emmeline I could get Prissy {{in spite of}} her," [...] said Stephen savagely. [...] "But if Prissy doesn't want me I'm not going to force <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> on her." ...|$|R
25|$|He {{always got}} <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{when he stood}} up and took the microphone. He would stop every Member in their tracks to hear what he had to say, and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that {{both sides of the aisle}} had for the gentleman from California.|$|E
25|$|I {{lived through}} the whole of it, being of an age to {{comprehend}} events, and giving <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to {{them in order to}} know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.|$|E
25|$|Melchizedek {{first came}} to <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> in June 1990, {{a few months after}} Mark Pedley was paroled from a 1986 conviction. Inquiries were {{received}} concerning bank names: Banco de Asia, Guardian Savings & Guaranty and Express Bank among others. Investigations that these entities had bank charters from the DOM and obtained through an entity named Consortium Finance Corporation headquartered in Lake Tahoe, California. Further investigation disclosed a principal alternately named John Hayden and Branch Vinedresser. Shortly thereafter the FBI took Branch Vinedresser into custody and revealed that he was Mark Pedley, who then was charged with violations of his parole.|$|E

60|$|It may not perhaps {{surprise}} {{the reader to}} learn that after Lilly Blythe's return to town, I did not prosecute my studies with as much enthusiasm as before. In fact I divided <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> pretty equally between Lilly and chemistry.|$|R
6000|$|Confess that I felt {{somewhat}} doubtful of {{the truth}} of this story; but, in order to prevent any expression of my face betraying me, I stooped and patted the dog while the man spoke.

25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>attention</b> {{has been}} {{directed}} to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state {{on behalf of the}} Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness {{both on and off the}} field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.|$|E
500|$|One of the passengers, Asa Cyrus Call, {{recalled}} [...] "a terrible jar and crashing of timbers...I {{hurried out}} on deck, where <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> was fixed {{on a wall}} of towering cliffs, the tops of which were hidden by the fog and darkness and appeared about to fall and crush us. All round was the loud booming of angry breakers surging about invisible rocks." ...|$|E

6000|$|The man {{burst into}} a hearty laugh. [...] "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," [...] said he, [...] "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late {{acquaintance}} {{are going to be}} to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard." ...|$|R
500|$|According to a 2010 VA memo, {{the problem}} of [...] "gaming strategies" [...] inside the VA to meet {{performance}} goals dates to at least 2008. VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote, [...] "It has come to <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{that in order to}} improve scores on assorted access measures, certain facilities have adopted use of inappropriate scheduling practices..." [...] Schoenhard listed 24 tactics identified in a 2008 study as inappropriately reducing the official measures of patient wait times.|$|E
500|$|He prefers {{shooting}} on film to digital video, and opposes {{the use of}} digital intermediates and digital cinematography, which he feels are less reliable and offer inferior image quality to film. In particular, the director advocates {{for the use of}} higher-quality, larger-format film stock such as anamorphic 35mm, VistaVision, 65mm and IMAX. Nolan uses multi-camera for stunts and single-camera for all the dramatic action, from which he will then watch dailies every night; [...] "Shooting single-camera means I've already seen every frame as it's gone through the gate because <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> isn't divided to multi-cameras." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea {{to create}} a story {{involving}} the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "Unit 731 first came to <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{at the same time}} as it did for a lot of other people, when I read it in the New York Times about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during the Second World War." [...] Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received [...] "clemency so [...] could use their science" [...] would be [...] "interesting".|$|E

Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have {{not been in the}} habit of brooking disappointment." ...|$|R
500|$|Morris's {{tenure as}} an {{instructor}} in Litchfield {{was cut short}} when, within months of arriving, he received an unsolicited ensign's commission in the Connecticut militia, which he accepted. [...] While {{in the service of}} the Connecticut militia Morris saw his first action, fighting battles in both Long Island and White Plains. In his memoirs, Morris wrote of this time, stating that [...] "The soldiers universally manifested a great respect for me, for my care of the sick and <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to their wants, and for my sympathies in their distresses." ...|$|E
500|$|Synge {{joined the}} Dublin Naturalists' Field Club {{and read the}} works of Charles Darwin. He wrote: [...] "When I was about {{fourteen}} I obtained a book of Darwin's.... My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round... to a temperate Nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Terri {{has been}} poorly {{received}} by critics. The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called her [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and the show's [...] "one big flaw". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly has described {{her as a}} [...] "shrill, lying nag", whose main function is to bring the audience down. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, however, has praised Gilsig's acting in the role, and stated that his hatred of the character dissipated once her fake pregnancy was exposed. He noted that: [...] "Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames", and while he still isn't [...] "in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> on the sidelines, as opposed to filing my nails until halftime. Baby steps, right?" ...|$|E

Now I have a faint {{recollection}} of drifting for days upon the sea in an open boat--beyond that all is blank. I shall not force <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> upon Virginia until I can prove my identity, and that my past is one which I can lay before her without shame--until then I shall not see her." ...|$|R

500|$|Gerrick Kennedy, in {{a review}} of [...] "Mattress" [...] for the Los Angeles Times, noted that in {{previous}} reviews he had [...] "never been shy of [...] disdain for Mrs. Schuester". He called her [...] "manipulative, heartless [...] shrill", and added that [...] "this whole train wreck of a fake pregnancy just added fuel to the fire that became a raging inferno of hate for Terri." [...] He also noted: [...] "Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames", and while he still isn't [...] "in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> on the sidelines, as opposed to filing my nails until halftime.

500|$|... "Right Round" [...] {{was written}} by Flo Rida, Dr. Luke, Kool Kojak, DJ Frank E, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and Dead or Alive, the band whose 1984 song, [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] is sampled in the chorus. The track was {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha, (who was not credited on the American release of the single). At the end of 2008, Luke {{was working on a}} track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round" [...] and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals. According to Flo Rida, the song is about [...] "a young lady, she might be in the strip club and she's got my head spinning round, [...] Or any young lady that I might see walking past me that's getting <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> She got it going on! I'm going crazy over her." ...|$|E
500|$|Kateřina's health {{gradually}} worsened and in {{the spring}} of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died [...] "gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to her." [...] After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, {{and fell in love with}} Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.|$|E
