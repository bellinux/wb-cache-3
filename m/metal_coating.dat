5|$|The {{helmet and}} visor were cast from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white <b>metal</b> <b>coating,</b> indicating that the visor would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. The visor would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E
25|$|The {{artisans}} {{with the}} highest social status were those who worked with metals and feathers, {{as well as those}} who worked with semi precious stones. The reason for this was that these artisan produced goods used by the ruling classes as well as offerings to the gods. Michoacán was one of Mesoamerica’s major metal working centers, mastering hammering, <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> and metal casting by the time the Spanish arrived. Most metal work was in gold, but the Purépecha had developed some copper work. Most of the products were ornaments for the ruling classes but some utilitarian items such as needles, fishhooks and hole punches were made. Luxury goods made with fine feathers was a particularly appreciated by Purépecha society. Goods such as caps, blankets, clothing, headdresses and ornamental staffs adorned with feathers were used only by priests and rulers as symbols of power and dignity. Artisans who made these objects had their own designation, “izquarecucha.” Purépecha stone work includes the working of turquoise and other semi precious stones along with obsidian. Most were used in adornments and offerings but obsidian was also used for agricultural tools of high economic value, weapons and sacrificial knives. Stoneworkers’ graves can be identified by their goods, which included their tools and raw materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Literature {{consists}} a lot {{of information}} concerning the issues of the fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastics. However few studies explicitly explain, what mechanisms decide on the increased fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastics. Therefore an expression is a purpose of the work on what a way increasing this fatigue endurance permanence is taking a place. Design/methodology/approach: In hereby article they discussed issues concerning the fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastic. Authors are putting the thesis on the basis of an analysis of literature and own examinations, that <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with material are characterized by an increased fatigue endurance. Findings: On the basis of results conclusions concerning raising the fatigue endurance permanence of some <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> were deduced from an experiment with material. Research limitations/implications: Examinations were concentrated only on determining the influence of the electrode potential and power of adhesion on metal samples (steel 20 and 45) covered with different coatings. To the purpose of demonstrating the increased fatigue endurance permanence of analyzed samples they limited themselves to experiments taking into consideration the strength to turning and bending. Practical implications: Get results of research are broadening their knowledge of the scope of changes of the fatigue strength of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastic. Originality/value: Authors are making a demand that the considerable increase of the fatigue endurance permanence of tested samples is caused with influence of electric double layer by adhesive force of the <b>coating</b> to <b>metal...</b>|$|R

A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1µm thickness, layers are deposited by chrome plating, and are used for decorative surfaces. If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.|$|E

A 20 m length of active fibre was coiled into a planar arrangement and mounted onto a high emissivity heatsink. Up to 405 W of output power was achieved without the need for active water or forced air cooling. The slope efficiency of this source was 74 % and maximum outer heat sink temperature was ~ 140 °C. This arrangement allowed for significant weight and size savings to be achieved with the active fibre laser head weighing less than 100 g.

An attempt to eliminate the leak was made by pouring in with 20 sacks of flour, thus filling the cracks with dough. However, the leak continued, and the service personnel discovered icing on the right side of the building. The method was clearly ineffective. The leak's volume was estimated from the size of the icing to be about 30 L/day. A commission consisting of naval specialists and the building's designers was created in order to determine the cause of the leak. The most likely cause was determined to be destruction of the pool's <b>metal</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E
