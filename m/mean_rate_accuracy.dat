Eighteen native Chinese speaking adults were recruited {{to take part in}} a Stroop experiment consisting of one-character color words and pseudowords which were orthographically similar to these color words. Classic behavioral Stroop effects, namely longer reaction times for incongruent conditions than for congruent conditions, were demonstrated for color words and pseudowords. A clear N 450 was also observed in the two incongruent conditions. The participants were also asked to perform a visual judgment task immediately following the Stroop experiment. Results from the visual judgment task showed that participants could distinguish color words and pseudowords well (with a <b>mean</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> over 90 percent).

The 1980 Amendments also mandated that non-permanent disability cases must be reviewed every three years (CDRs). As {{a result of the}} 1980 Amendments, SSA established a DDS performance accuracy threshold of 90.6 percent combined <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> for initial allowances and denials and began undertaking quality assurance reviews (QARs). The 90.6 percent level was somewhat arbitrarily chosen, {{based on the fact that}} it represented one and one-half standard deviations from the <b>mean</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> at that time.

In addition, the SSA requires that DDSs meet standards of timeliness, with the target case processing time of 49.5 calendar days or less for DI applicants and 57.9 days or less for SSI applicants.

Recently, the right hemisphere was proposed to contribute more than the left hemisphere for speech perception in an acoustically noisy environment. For testing this hypothesis, 40 right handed native Cantonese speakers were recruited for dichotic listening tests. Paired syllables were presented to participants in quiet and in noise (signal to noise ratio were set to 0 dB and - 10 dB in two separate conditions). The two syllables in each pair differed from each other in consonant, vowels, or tones. Participants were asked to verbally repeat the syllable they thought was clearer. <b>Accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated for each ear. For the quiet condition, the <b>mean</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly higher for syllables presented to the right ear than those presented to the left ear for consonants, vowels, and tones.

In recent years, the application of boosting algorithm has become popular among various classifiers. As a machine learning method, ensemble boosting devotes to finding rough rules of thumb other than getting a high prediction rate rule. Especially, its superiority is reflected in avoiding overfitting and high probability of classification in high-dimensional space. In this paper, we employ boosting classifier instead of single classifier to build a high accuracy for the pattern recognition.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} literature on performance appraisal {{is well established}} but suffers from two inter-related problems. First, rater training has lacked theoretical justification.

Second, performance appraisal research has focused on rating errors, not the more important issue of <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy.</b> While recent attempts have been made toward understanding accuracy, these attempts again lack theoretical structure. The problem with these shot-gun approaches is that scientific understanding is not advanced in a systematic manner, since there are few attempts to disprove theories. ^ The present study was an attempt to understand previous performance appraisal findings by incorporating theories and research from the person-perception field of psychology. Specifically, the current 3 x 2 x 3 study manipulated theoretically-based cognitive schema rater training (Person/Event/Control) and rating time (immediate/delay) as between subjects factors and rating instrument format (behavior frequency scale/performance evaluation scale) as a within subjects factor. The major hypothesis predicted that the type of cognitive schema employed by raters as they watched videotaped lectures would interact with the instrument format to affect <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy.</b> It was also hypothesized that <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> would be related to one 2 ̆ 7 s memory, such that as time and schemas affected memory that there would be corresponding changes in <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy.</b> ^ Results showed that only one of the three component measures of <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> (differential elevation) was affected by an interaction between rater training and rating format. While recognition bias and sensitivity behaved as predicted (prototypical bias exceeded antiprototypical bias, antiprototypical sensitivity exceeded prototypical sensitivity, antiprototypical bias decreased across time), an improvement in <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> was not associated with a reduction in antiprototypical bias. ^ Overall, the present study could not explain some of the previous research findings on <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy.</b> However it represents an important step toward a theoretical integration of rater training with the rating instrument form. ...|$|R

Next three measures of <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy,</b> that is, <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> measure, <b>rating</b> error measure, and psychometric criteria, were discussed. <b>Rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> measure is mainly described by how close an actual rating compares with an expert 2 ̆ 7 s rating.

Psychometric criteria is defined by reliability, such as the rating differences among individuals, and validity, such as construct validity.

For each segment, we calculate statistics such as the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of energy dissipation and the mean energy at each scale. Their values significantly fluctuate, in lognormal distributions at least as a good approximation. Each segment is not under equilibrium between the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of energy dissipation and the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of energy transfer that determines the mean energy. These two rates still correlate among segments when their length exceeds the correlation length. Also between the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of energy dissipation and the mean total energy, there is a correlation characterized by the Reynolds number for the whole record, implying that the large-scale flow affects each of the segments.

The study also investigated the types of errors laypeople make when forming these judgments. Sixty-seven undergraduates assessed 22 offenders on their level of psychopathy, violence, likability, and attractiveness. Psychopathy <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> improved as rater extroversion-sociability and agreeableness increased and when neuroticism and lifestyle and antisocial characteristics decreased. These results suggest that traits associated with nonverbal <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> or social functioning may be important in threat detection.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy’s answer for many future manpower and financial policy questions {{rests on the}} ability of the individual performance appraisal system to optimally signal officer productivity. This paper utilizes the economics literature on individual performance appraisals and promotion systems as the lens through which to conduct a comparative analysis between the Navy and Marine performance appraisal systems. <b>Rating</b> <b>accuracy,</b> differentiation of talent, and performance comparison methods comprise the bulk of the analysis. The results show a Marine system that exceeds the Navy’s in signal officer productivity. The Navy’s system provides limited assurance for <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> and the differentiation of talent. Once insight is gained through analysis, a metric is developed to further improve the measurement of individual productivity. This paper recommends the Navy improve <b>rating</b> <b>accuracy</b> through leadership messaging, policy change, and rater training. Second, relative comparison methods should be required to force differentiation of talent and align with the Navy’s tournament theory incentive structure. Third, to reduce costs and improve human capital management an individual productivity metric should be developed that is based on the output of the performance appraisal.

40|$|As retinopathies {{continue}} to be major causes of visual loss and blindness worldwide, early detection and management of these diseases will help achieve significant reduction of blindness cases. However, an efficient automatic retinal vessel segmentation approach remains a challenge. Since efficient vessel network detection {{is a very important}} step needed in ophthalmology for reliable retinal vessel characterization, this paper presents study on the combination of difference image and K-means clustering for the segmentation of retinal vessels. Stationary points in the vessel center-lines are used to model the detection of twists in the vessel segments. The combination of arc-chord ratio with stationary points is used to compute tortuosity index. Experimental results show that the proposed K-means combined with difference image achieved a robust segmentation of retinal vessels. A maximum average accuracy of 0. 9556 and a maximum average sensitivity of 0. 7581 were achieved on DRIVE database while a maximum average accuracy of 0. 9509 and a maximum average sensitivity of 0. 7666 were achieved on STARE database. When compared with the previously proposed techniques on DRIVE and STARE databases, the proposed technique yields higher mean sensitivity and <b>mean</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates</b> in the same range of very good specificity. In a related development, a non-normalized tortuosity index that combined distance metric and the vessel twist frequency proposed in this paper also achieved a strong correlation of 0. 80 with the expert ground truth...|$|R

One of the most important challenges in network intrusion detection research area is designing an accurate intrusion detection system in terms of high detection <b>rate,</b> high <b>accuracy</b> and low false alarm rate. Hybrid learning approaches employ to deal with this challenge since, they have promising results in terms of detection <b>rate,</b> <b>accuracy</b> and false alarm rate. This paper, proposed a general structure of a hybrid learning approach. Then, the proposed approach has been implemented using K-means Clustering and Multiple Classifiers (KCMC). The data have been partitioned based on K-means clustering algorithm. Then, each partition classified using a distinct classifier. Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and OneR classification algorithms have been used as the classifiers. The proposed hybrid approach has better results comparing to single classifiers in terms of detection <b>rate,</b> <b>accuracy</b> and false alarm rate.
