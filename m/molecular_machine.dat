25|$|This {{led to an}} {{exchange}} of letters in the ACS publication Chemical & Engineering News in 2003. Though biology clearly demonstrates that <b>molecular</b> <b>machine</b> systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy. Leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are Dr. Alex Zettl {{and his colleagues at}} Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley. They have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage: a nanotube nanomotor, a molecular actuator, and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator. See nanotube nanomotor for more examples.|$|E

A number of molecules, such as molecular propellers, have been designed, although experimental studies of these molecules are inhibited {{by the lack of}} methods to construct these molecules.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, chemists have {{designed}} and constructed a large variety of artificial <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> Understanding of the fundamental principles behind motion at the molecular scale {{is key to the}} development of such devices. Motion at the molecular level is very different from that experienced in the macroscopic world: molecular devices have to operate in a constant thermal noise and must therefore make use of the specificity of chemical reactions or external stimuli to produce work. In this thesis we, have investigated how non-covalent interactions between the components of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> govern their operation. The principal technique we use to investigate the mechanics of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> is time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy. In this thesis, we observed the directional motion of invisible machines with invisible light. We learned that the operation of molecular devices is intrinsically random due the environment in which they operate. We were able to accelerate the operation of hydrogen-bonding <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> with water, and discovered that this type of "lubrication" could also occur in biological systems. We proved that the rupture of the non-covalent interactions between the components of the <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> investigated here is the step which determines the speed at which they operate and that quantum mechanical effects can be used to influence the operation of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> Finally, we followed and characterized the conformational changes of the components of a molecular shuttle during its operation cycle in a time-resolved manner...|$|R

2500|$|When {{the term}} [...] "nanotechnology" [...] was {{independently}} coined and popularized by Eric Drexler (who {{at the time}} was unaware of an earlier usage by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on <b>molecular</b> <b>machine</b> systems.

50|$|Many {{mechanically}} interlocked molecules {{have been}} studied to construct <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> Because the molecules are linked by mechanical bonds instead of conventional covalent bonds, a component can move (shuttle) or rotate around the other parent component, which results in {{the large amount of}} freedom of mechanically interlocked molecules. Polyrotaxanes, as the polymer form of corresponding rotaxanes, are also applied in <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{ribosome}} (...) is {{a complex}} <b>molecular</b> <b>machine,</b> found within all living cells, {{that serves as the}} site of biological protein synthesis (translation). Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal [...] subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins (r-protein or rProtein). The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|Drexler {{argues that}} {{we may need to}} wait until our {{conventional}} nanotechnology improves before solving these issues: [...] "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in <b>molecular</b> <b>machine</b> systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel rocket systems. We are now in a position like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle." [...] However, Freitas and Merkle argue [...] that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their [...] "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".|$|E
2500|$|Rotaxane-based {{molecular}} machines {{have been}} of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular shuttles. These molecular machines are usually based on {{the movement of the}} macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a molecular switch, with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [...] and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles. In 2009, there was a report of a [...] "domino effect" [...] from one extremity to the other in a Glycorotaxane <b>Molecular</b> <b>Machine.</b> In this case, the 4C1 or 1C4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.|$|E
40|$|Only volume 2 {{has been}} digitized. <b>Molecular</b> <b>machines</b> are {{essential}} components of living organisms. They are highly efficient and robust, {{much more than}} their macroscopic analogs. This stimulated growing interest in construction of artificial <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> {{with a set of}} functions which may be controlled in a specific way. Such man-made molecular complexes are designed as the building blocks for future nanotechnological devices. During the last decades many new <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> have been synthesized and characterized by various experimental techniques. This significantly increased our knowledge about systems of such kind and their functioning. However, {{there are only a few}} real applications of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> This is because the fundamental principles of operation of such single-molecule systems are not well understood. Existing theoretical studies, although very helpful, are still very sparse. This is because the <b>molecular</b> <b>machines</b> are very complex systems, comprising up to thousands atoms. Thus the progress in our understanding of nanoscale materials is tightly related to development of efficient computational and theoretical methodologies. In this work we studied two large classes of molecular machines: surface-moving nanocars and molecular rotors/motors, working on the surfaces and in crystalline state. In particular we studied the role of the internal interactions of these machines as well as their interactions with the environment. This included the flexibility of the molecules, including the rotation of the nanocars' wheels, effects of surface and rotors symmetry, charge transfer effects as well as many other factors. We have found out relations which determine the properties of studied classes of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> The development of computational and theoretical methods was another essential part of this work. In particular we have developed a family of the surface-molecule interaction potentials, aimed to performing long time scale and molecular simulations of complex systems. We also developed a physics-based model of the charge transfer happening between metals and the nanocars. This opened new ways to control such <b>molecular</b> <b>machines.</b> We also developed a theoretical framework to predict response of molecular rotors on various types of driving. Finally, we developed new and improved existing rigid-body molecular dynamics methods and extensively used them in our studies of <b>molecular</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since their}} discovery, stable organic {{radicals}} have received considerable attention from chemists {{because of their}} unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties.
