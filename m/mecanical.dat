Optimization of analytical methods for the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and -furans (PCDF), identification or organic pollutants and provision of analytical capacity. Main emphasis of the work; mass spectrometric high resolution determination of PCDD/DF. Results for PCDD/DF-determintion methods: Development of a quick and simple clean-up method for water samples. Extension of the method to oil-, sediment- and mineralic matrices by further clean-up steps. Resutls of PCDD/DF-analyses: PCDD/DF occurred at levels of 500 to 5000 fg/g in the static water of the disposal site, even if a separate oil-phase was not observed in the well. <b>Mecanical</b> treatment (flotation) resulted in elimination rates in excess of 90 % of PCDD/DF from the water, if the input load was high. At low load the elimination rate dropped to 35 %. PCDD/DF input into the biological treatment plant was too low to permit monitoring within the plant. Condensation from the gas produced at the disposal site contained low amounts of PCDD/DF. Oils from the site were dechlorinated by pyrolysis, sodium treatment and electrochemically. PCVDD/DF were substantially reduced by these treatments. Results of identification of organic compounds: Mainly compounds from the oil-phase and technical products were found in static disposal site water. Chlorobenzenes were important chlorinated contaminants. Organics were reduced by biological treatment, but pollutants like chlorobenzenes survived and could only be removed by charcoal-absorption.

The tumors are generally smaller and less numerous {{than those of the}} domestic rabbit, but sometimes there were noted large and flat lesions (fig. 3). The natural infection of the wild rabbit may be quite common not only because many rabbits caught in the country were found to be immune as also because it was found among the animals caught in the country near Rio, one that was infected with mixomatosis. The experimental infection of the Sylvilagus may be easily obtained by cutan, subcutan or conjuntival way and also when a health wild rabbit is placed in the same cage with a sick domestic animal. It is also possible to obtain the infection of the wild and domestic rabbits by the bite of infected blood sucking insects as fleas and mosquitoes. The infected mosquito can transmit the disease 2 or 3 times til 17 days after an infective meal on a sick rabbit. The transmission is a <b>mecanical</b> one and only the proboscis of the insect contains the virus as it was shown by the inoculation of emulsions of the proboscis, thorax and abdomen of the mosquito.

It was found that accelerated ageing conditions that mimic indoor daylight exposures overestimate the yellowing tendencies of hardwood high-yield pulps (especially aspen pulps) compared to long-term ambient aging with no indirect sunlight present. It was, however, possible to predict the yellowing characteristics of softwood high-yield pulps. The lignin content of the pulps was found to be strongly correlated with the degree of photo-yellowing in the case of long-term ambient light-induced ageing.

Our objective is to describe a case of Hopkins Syndrome in Brazil affecting a patient younger than 1 year. CASE: Male 4 months-old infant, started presenting wheezing that turned into respiratory failure which required <b>mecanical</b> ventilation. Three days later he initiated with loss of strength in the lower limbs (LL). The patient was dismissed from hospital better of his respiratory complains but still paraparetic. Five months later, the patient returned with another episode of severe bronchospasm. At that time, he presented with flaccid paralysis, arreflexia and atrophy of the LL. There were no upper limbs and sensory abnormalities. The patient undergone to lumbar puncture, spinal MRI and SEPs which were all normal. MUSCLE BIOPSY: type grouping. EMG and NCS were in keeping with motor neuron disease affecting just the lumbosacral region. CONCLUSION: Hopkins syndrome {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of any flaccid paralysis when it is associated with an asthma attack. ...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{dogs were}} {{used for this study}} of cardiac <b>mecanical</b> efficiency. Seventeen point eight % (mean) of the artificially infarcted {{myocardium}} of the left ventricle were resected and sutured. The dogs were classified into two groups (5 effective, 5 noneffective). It was designated that the effective group showed no remarkable changes in left ventricular pressure (LVP), three hours after the infarctectomy in comparison with 30 minutes after infarctectomy, while the noneffective group showed a marked decrease. The datum in each experimental and operative stage was scored with the ratio to 100 % in control stage (intact stage). After infarctectomy, percentages to control values of stroke volume and stroke work were significantly lower than those of TTI and dp/dt/P 50, which are generally admitted to be correlative to the myocardial oxygen consumption volume. This phenomenon was especially noted in the noneffective group. These facts would show that cardiac mechanical efficiencies differed in the two groups. Several parameters of the cardiac mechanical efficiency has been provided by the author. i) SW/TTI, ii) SW/(TTI-SV), [=(MEAOP-LVEDP) /TTI], (MEAOP: mean aortic pressure in ejection time, LVEDP: left ventricular enddiastolic pressure), iii) SW/(LVEDP-SV), [=(MEAOPLVEDP) /LVEDP], iv) ET(CI) ･SW/(TTI-SV), [=ET(CI) ･E(MEAOP-LVEDP) /TTI, (ET(CI) : ejection time) ]. The iv) parameter represents the ratio of impulse (force × time), which was calculated by using the cardiovascular formula of energy: Wp=P(t) -Q(t) dt in both the numerator and the denominator. SW=∮P(t) ･△QAdt=△QA･∮P(t) dt=△QA･TTIAOP,∮P(t) ･△Qvdt=△Qv･∮P(t) dt=△Qv･TTI(LVP), ∮P(t) ･△QAdt/∮P(t) ･△Qvdt=(△QA/△Qv) (TTI(AOP) /TTI(LVP)), (△QA: mean ejection volume, △QV: mean LV volume, during one beat). Therefore, assuming that △QA/△QV=K(constant) : if an individual and physiological condition of heart, for instance, as the value of ejection fraction is constant, then, the iv) parameter represents the ratio of energy-the cardiac mechanical efficiency. Circulating blood volume had less influence upon these parameters of efficiency than upon SV and SW. When SV and SW showed significant depression after infarctectomy also in the effective group, these parameters of efficiency showed no remarkable change in the effective group, but these parameters of efficiency showed significant difference between the effective group and the noneffective group. Judging the results of the various data of parameters, it was considered that the hearts were overworking also in the effective group, and these cardiac mechanical efficiencies decreased in the noneffective group, moreover, the hearts of those group fell into decompensation. The prognosis was poor in the case in which cardiac mechanical efficiency decreased when cardiac work was relatively increased by infarctectomy, and suture; and the improvement of the efficiency for the heart would be necessary. Therefore parameter i), ii), iii) and iv) may be valuable indicators of the cardiac mechanical efficiency, as far as TTI correlates with myocardial oxygen consumption volume...|$|E
40|$|Conventional two {{dimensional}} scanning methods operate by a two axis variable mirror system to deflect onel aser beam {{over the whole}} image field. Hence there occur two different deflection frequencies, {{one of which is}} the critical horizontal deflection frequency in the kHz regime and the other one is the uncritical vertical frequency of about 10 OHz. The horizontal deflection frequency is difficult to achieve with <b>mecanical</b> means because precisely manufactured polygon mirrors must be employed to achieve a pointing stability good enough for printing and display applications. A number of devices have been developed recently to find alternatives to the conventional method. The axial line scanner intends to resolve this problem by utilizing a different scanning method: always one complete line is imaged in one scanning step and to obtain a complete {{two dimensional}} image it is thus just necessary to shift the lines vertically. The same concept could be applied in printing equipment where a rotating shaft is placed in front of the axial line scanner. To realize this concept it is neccessary to generate simultaneously a discrete number of points with equal beam characteristics and a fixed pitch. Furthermore these applications require an independant modulation of each channel's output power in order to generate intensity dependant effects. A system that fulfills all the requirements presented above can be developed as an integrated optic. LiNbO 3 was chosen as host material because of it's superior electrooptical properties. With standard lithographical methods an array of Titanium indiffused waveguides has been manufactured. These waveguides have a nominal with of 3 mu m and operate in transversal single mode at the working vvavelength of 532 nm. According to the fact that Ti-diffused waveguides guide the light of both polarizations TF and TM the modulation itself can be realized by a phase-modulator which allows sufficiently fast modulation and in particular the smallest possible pitch between the waveguides. The system realized contains 32 waveguide channels with a pitch of 500 mu m. The radiation of a diode pumped solid state laser is coupled by aids of zylindrical lenses and microlens arrays into the waveguides. A ring resonator design was chosen as beamsource. Due to the large difference of the ordinary and the extraordinary refractive indices of LiNb 03 the waveguide acts as a very high order waveplate with a small bandwidth, hence the single mode concept effectively avoids modulation problems attributed to this effect. There are several advantages of the axial line scanner to the mechanical technique: the system is fast and can be miniaturized. Attributed to it's all optical design the lifetime of this device is much higher since no mechanical degradation occurs. It can easily be scaled to a higher density allowing more distinct points and thus a higher resolution and the manufacturing process can be done by utilizing the standard equipment available in semiconductor processing environments...|$|E
40|$|Objetivo: Evaluar la utilidad de la tomografía computada {{helicoidal}} (TCH) en el diagnóstico y manejo terapéutico de la diverticulitis aguda. Materiales y métodos: Estudio de cohorte retrospectivo realizado sobre un periodo de 6 meses que incluyó a 100 pacientes con sospecha clínica de diverticulitis. Se efectuó TCH con contraste oral y endovenoso, salvo contraindicación. Los estudios se correlacionaron con la respuesta terapéutica y el seguimiento clínico y con cirugía e histopatología cuando fue necesario tratamiento quirúrgico. Resultados: De 100 pacientes estudiados, 62 tuvieron diagnóstico tomográfico de diverticulitis; de ellas, 41 fueron diverticulitis simples y 21, complicadas (absceso, flemón, plastrón, perforación libre, fístula vésicocolónica y obstrucción intestinal); en 24 pacientes se realizó diagnóstico alternativo (apendicitis, apendagitis, colitis inespecífica, colitis isquémica, pielonefritis, litiasis ureteral, pancreatitis, salpingitis, quiste de uraco complicado, obstrucción colónica mecánica y perforación colónica por cuerpo extraño) y en 14, diagnóstico de ausencia de diverticulitis aguda, sin diagnóstico alternativo, siendo dos de ellos falsos negativos por clínica y respuesta al tratamiento. La TCH para la diverticulitis demostró: sensibilidad: 96, 87 %; especificidad: 100 %; valor predictivo positivo: 100 %; valor predictivo negativo: 94, 7 %; certeza: 98 %. De los 41 pacientes con diagnóstico tomográfico de diverticulitis no complicada, 37 recibieron tratamiento médico ambulatorio y 4, tratamiento médico con internación; de los 21 pacientes con diagnóstico de diverticulitis complicada, 18 realizaron un tratamiento médico con internación y en 3 se tomó una conducta quirúrgica; de los 14 pacientes con ausencia de hallazgos tomográficos de diverticulitis, en 12 se adoptó una conducta expectante ambulatoria y 2 recibieron tratamiento médico ambulatorio. Conclusión: La tomografía es muy útil y eficaz para el diagnóstico, evaluación y {{manejo de}} los pacientes con sospecha clínica de diverticulitis. Objective: The {{evaluation of the}} usefulness of helical computed tomography (HCT) in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of the acute diverticulitis. Materials and methods: Six months retrospective cohort study of 100 patient population clinically suspected of diverticulitis was carried out. The exams were made with oral and intravenous contrast unless the patient presented contraindications. A correlation of these studies with the therapeutic response and clinical follow up was done with surgery and histopathology. Results: From a total of 100 patients studied, 62 presented tomographic diagnosis of diverticulitis, 41 were classified as simple diverticulitis and 21 were complicated cases (abscess, phlegmon, plastron, free perforation, vesicocolonic fistula and intestinal obstruction). In 24 patients an alternative diagnosis was made (appendicitis, appendagitis, uretheral litiasis, colitis, salpingitis, pancreatitis, uraco cyst complication, colonic <b>mecanical</b> obstruction, colonic perforation with foreign body) : 14 patients did not present tomographic findings to support the clinical symptoms, {{two of them were}} false-negative by the clinic and by the response to treatment. These data represented a sensibility of 96, 87 %, specificity of 100 %, PPV of 100 % and NPV of 94, 7 % and a certainty of 98 for the tomography diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. Of the 41 patients with tomographic diagnostic of not complicated diverticulitis, 37 received medical outpatient treatment and only 4 medical treatment with placement; of the 21 patients diagnosed with complicated diverticulitis, 18 were hospitalised with medical treatment and the other 3 patients needed surgery; of the 14 patients without tomographic findings of diverticulitis, in 12 outpatients an expectant conduct was followed and the other 2 received medical outpatient treatment. Conclusion: HCT is very useful and effective in diagnosis, evaluation and management of patients with clinical suspicion of diverticulitis...|$|E
40|$|O Rio Grande do Sul possui atualmente 411. 000 {{hectares}} de sua superfície plantada com essências florestais exóticas. A tendência desses plantios no Estado é ocupar áreas com terrenos declivosos com limitado valor agropecuário e altamente suceptíveis à erosão hídrica. A fragilidade desses solos implica na necessidade de efetuar-se um planejamento criterioso dos talhões, face ao grande risco erosivo compreendido entre o plantio e o fechamento do dossel da floresta. O estudo buscou identificar e quantificar o efeito de métodos de preparo de solo e {{manejo de}} resíduos da colheita sobre a erosão hídrica (sustentabilidade) e o desenvolvimento inicial da floresta (produtividade). O ensaio foi instalado em uma área experimental da Aracruz Celulose e Papel S. A. no Horto Florestal Faxinal, localizado no município de Arroio dos Ratos na região fisiográfica denominada Depressão Central. O ensaio experimental foi instalado em outubro de 2006 em uma área de Cambissolo háplico. Os tratamentos escolhidos para o experimento foram baseados em práticas de manejo que são empregados no estabelecimento de povoamentos florestais. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso com três repetições, os blocos foram demarcados aleatoriamente dentro do horto florestal. Os tratamentos testados foram à subsolagem interrompida com resíduo, subsolagem contínua com resíduo, subsolagem contínua sem resíduo, todos no sentido do declive, e coveamento mecânico. A subsolagem sem resíduo a favor do declive mostrou-se um método de preparo mais erosivo do que o coveamento manual com resíduo, com perda anual de 11, 05 e 0, 16 Mg ha ano- 1, respectivamente. A água escoada superficialmente nos tratamentos com resíduo foi de 1, 6 % e na subsolagem sem resíduo o escoamento foi de 2, 9 % do total precipitado. O preparo mais intensivo do solo aumenta a erosão, porém favorece o crescimento inicial do eucalipto. Observase que para os dois períodos analisados as parcelas subsoladas sem resíduos apresentaram os maiores teores de nutrientes contido na parte aérea. A manutenção dos resíduos de colheita proporciona um adequado desenvolvimento das plantas de eucalipto e reduz a perda de água, solo e nutrientes. The Rio Grande do Sul has currently 411, 000 hectares of its area forested with exotic essences. The tendency of these plantations in the State is to occupy sloped areas with limited agrarian value and highly likely to water erosion. The fragility of these soils implies {{the need of}} a microplanning of the area, given the high risk of water erosion between the planting and soil covernizer by the forest canopy. The study sought to identify and quantify the effect of methods of preparation of soil and solid waste management of the harvest on water erosion (sustainability) and the initial development of the forest (productivity). The test was installed in an experimental area of Aracruz Celulose e Papel S. A. In Horto Florestal Faxinal, located in the municipality of Arroio of Rats in the fisiografic region called Depression Center. The test trial was installed in October 2006 {{in an area of}} Typic Dystrochept in the municipality of Arroio dos Ratos. The treatment chosen for the experiment were based on management practices that are sometimes employed in the establishment of forest. The experimental design was used to block at random with three repetitions. The blocks were randomly within the demarcated forest garden. The treatments tested were subsoiling interrupted with residue, subsoiling continuing with residue, subsoiling continuing without residue and coveamento mechanic. The subsoiling without residue in of the slope has been the method of preparation more erosion than <b>mecanical</b> pit with waste, with annual loss of 11. 05 Mg ha- 1 ano- 1 and 0. 16 Mg ha- 1 ano- 1. Water overland flow treatment with residue was 1. 6 %. In subsolagem without waste the bleeding was 2. 9 %. The preparation more intensive soil erosion increases but favors the initial growth of eucalyptus. It is observed that for the two periods analyzed the parcels subsoladas without waste produced the greatest nutrient content contained in the air. The maintenance of waste collection provides an appropriate development of eucalyptus plants and reduces the loss of water, and soil nutrients...|$|E
