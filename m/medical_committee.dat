5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus freeing up a space in the first-team squad. The LFP's <b>medical</b> <b>committee</b> decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E

500|$|Eleven British alpine skiers {{took part}} in the Games, ten in the men's events and one in the women's. All five of Britain's medals at the Games were won in alpine skiing events. The team's only silver medal was won by Richard Burt in the giant slalom B3 {{classification}} and he also won a bronze in the super-G B3. Burt almost missed his silver medal run when race officials started prematurely resetting the slalom course, but Burt's sighted guide Keith Hockley noticed and took him up the mountain to complete the race. [...] Matthew Stockford, the reigning world champion in downhill, won three bronze medals in the downhill, super-G and giant slalom events of the LW10 classification. After Stockford won the bronze in downhill, the British delegation filed a protest claiming that the two American skiers ahead of him should not have been in the LW10 category. [...] The <b>medical</b> <b>committee</b> rejected the protest on the grounds that all classifications had been determined {{at the start of the}} competition. [...] Both Burt and Stockford would go on to win medals at the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer.|$|E
2500|$|During Teresa's beatification and canonisation, the Roman Curia (the Vatican) studied {{published}} and unpublished criticism {{of her life}} and work. Hitchens and Chatterjee (author of The Final Verdict, a book critical of Teresa) spoke to the tribunal; according to Vatican officials, the allegations raised were investigated by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The group found no obstacle to Teresa's canonisation, and issued its nihil obstat on 21 April 1999. Because of the attacks on her, some Catholic writers called her a sign of contradiction. A separate <b>medical</b> <b>committee</b> ruled that the miracle of Monica Besra, one of three considered by Kolodiejchuk, was evidence of divine intercession. Teresa was beatified on 19 October 2003, and was known by Catholics as [...] "Blessed".|$|E
2500|$|The Army Medical Service was in disarray, {{between the}} {{military}} casualties, extremely high losses due to typhoid, yellow fever and other camp illnesses, political conflicts between Dr. John Morgan and Dr. William Shippen, Jr., and inadequate supplies and guidance from the <b>Medical</b> <b>Committee.</b> Nonetheless, Rush accepted an appointment as surgeon-general of the middle department of the Continental Army. Rush's order [...] "Directions for preserving the health of soldiers" [...] {{became one of the}} foundations of preventative military medicine and was repeatedly republished, including as late as 1908. However, Rush's reporting of Dr. Shippen's misappropriation of food and wine supplies intended to comfort hospitalized soldiers, under-reporting of patient deaths, and failure to visit the hospitals under his command, ultimately led to Rush's resignation in 1778.|$|E

2500|$|Announcing the ban, Sheikh Hamdan made it {{very clear}} that [...] "no-one would be {{permitted}} to ride camels in camel-races unless they had a minimum weight of 45 kg, and are not less than 15 years old, as stated in their passports." [...] He said a <b>medical</b> <b>committee</b> would examine each candidate to be a jockey to check that the age stated in their passport was correct and that the candidate was medically fit. Sheikh Hamdan said all owners of camel racing stables would be responsible for returning children under 15 to their home countries. He also announced the introduction of a series of penalties for those breaking the new rules. For a first offense, a fine of 20,000 AED was to be imposed. For a second offense, the offender would be banned from participating in camel races for a period of a year, while for third and subsequent offense, terms of imprisonment would be imposed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{historical}} terms, the American Medical Association's {{policy of}} allowing its consistent groups to be racially segregated {{in areas with}} widespread prejudice faced considerable opposition from doctors {{as well as other}} health care professionals. This came to a head during the Civil Rights Movement, pressure coming from organization such as the <b>Medical</b> <b>Committee</b> for Human Rights (MCHR), and the AMA finally gave up the policy in the late 1960s. Retrospective articles by the AMA's own publications have criticized the AMA's past tolerance of discrimination as against fundamental medical ethics. One such 2008 article used the title [...] "African American Physicians and Organized Medicine, 1846-1968: Origins of a Racial Divide". The intersection of race and health in the U.S. has long been a disputed topic relating to many factors. As well, in terms of history, the AMA's foot-dragging in helping foreign-trained medical professionals fleeing to the U.S. from Nazi-controlled Germany and adjacent nations has brought criticism. Despite a widespread need among natural-born Americans for health services, particularly {{in the context of the}} Great Depression, the number of newly licensed foreign-trained doctors after Adolf Hitler came to power remained similar to previous totals.|$|E
2500|$|Because of a {{paralysis}} {{that started}} in early 1961 and progressed quickly in 1966, on the 2nd February Cemal Gürsel was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. on the private airplane [...] "BlueBird" [...] sent by US President Lyndon B. Johnson. One week later, he fell into a coma there after suffering a series of new paralytic strokes. The government decided he return to Turkey on 24 March. President Johnson went by helicopter from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to pay his respects to President Cemal Gürsel on his departure to home, In addition to issuing the following statement 'Our distinguished friend, President Cemal Gursel of Turkey, came to the United States on 2 February for medical treatment. There was hope that new therapeutic procedures only recently developed in this country would be useful in treating his illness of several years. We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only to be shocked by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow. Our best talent, coupled with the skill of the eminent Turkish doctors who accompanied the President, was exerted to the utmost {{in the hope that}} the President might return to his home in fully restored health. We are saddened that this hope was not to be realized. We have been deeply honored to have President Gürsel come to our country to seek medical treatment. As he returns to his homeland, our prayers go with him'. With a report of a <b>medical</b> <b>committee</b> by Gülhane Military Hospital in Ankara, the parliament ruled on 28 March 1966 that his presidency be terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution. He died of apoplexy at 0645 hrs on 14 September 1966 in Ankara. He left behind no directives or last will. He was laid to rest at the [...] "Freedom Martyrs Memorial" [...] section in the yard of the mausoleum of Atatürk. His body was transferred on 27 August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery.|$|E
