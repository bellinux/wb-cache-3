30|$|In general, it is {{particularly}} difficult to fabricate periodic SiO 2 nanostructures with a good regularity and controllability in pattern size, roughness, and shape by a simple and efficient method, because {{it is difficult to}} find an appropriate mask and related excellent anisotropic etch process in nanometer scales. Furthermore, as chip architectures become increasingly complex, the use of hard mask to achieve a precise pattern transfer will be critically significant. Very often, multi-layer etch mask stacks composed of carbon-containing material, such as amorphous carbon or spin-on-carbon (SOC), and a few other material layers are widely applied in currently standard semiconductor nanofabrication [13, 14]. This kind of multi-layer stacks can improve the etch selectivity of photo resist to substrate materials during plasma patterning. However, the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>mask</b> plasma etch involves usually a complex process requiring expensive machinery and a very high process development cost. Any simplification of these processes offers a great advantage in both efficiency and cost, particularly for relatively small-scale production typical in research institutes.|$|E
40|$|In this project, {{fabrication}} and {{characterization of}} nano/microfluidic channels on borosilicate glass substrate {{were carried out}} using a Photo/Ultraviolet (UV) lithography method, which has applications in single-cell analysis. In our single-cell analysis glass system, the bacterial cells {{will be made to}} sit in the micrometer channels and also the sub-micron size channels around 300 nm is aspired so it helps in passing the fluid to the outlet hole while holding the cells back. This system will help in the microscopic analysis of the bacterial cell growth over generations. A <b>multi-layer</b> <b>mask</b> approach is used to pattern the etch masks on a glass for the consecutive Isotropic wet etching of the glass substrate. Isotropic wet etching is utilized to transfer the patterned structures from a metal mask to the glass and also to under etch the differently sized spacing pitches (area separating nano/microfluidic channels in our design) to obtain sub-micron channel dimensions. Many test structures were designed on the photomask to optimize during the fabrication process with combinations of differently sized channels with differently sized spacing pitches ranging from 300 nm to 300 µm dimensions. In order to obtain this sub-micron sized channels on glass using a UV lithography technique is a challenging task, so the initial aim was to use the designed spacing pitches present between the channels as a platform to isotopically etch and create an under etched space width size in sub-micrometer. But we were able to obtain channel structure in sub-micron scale directly by optimizing multiple steps of the fabrication process. Characterization of the nano/microfluidic channels was done with the help of Optical microscopy and Dektak profilometer to measure the width, depth and uniformity of the structures during the optimization of the lithography process and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken to analyze the channel dimensions and to get images of the fabricated channels. ...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the use of}} a <b>multi-layer</b> phase <b>mask</b> {{to produce}} fivebeam interference, {{three-dimensional}} photonic crystals can be formed through single exposure to a photoresist. In these holographically formed structures, the interconnectivity is controlled by the relative phase difference among contributing beams. Photonic band gaps are calculated and the simulation shows a maximum bandgap of 18 % of the middle gap frequency when the phase difference is optimized. A three-layer phase mask is fabricated by placing a spacer layer between two orthogonally-orientated gratings. The phase difference is controlled by thermal-tuning of the spacer thickness. Photonic crystal templates are holographically fabricated in a photosensitive polymer using the phase mask. © 2011 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse optical {{tomography}} is {{most accurate}} when an individual's MRI {{data can be}} used as a spatial prior for image reconstruction and for visualization of the resulting images of changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration. As this necessitates an MRI scan to be performed for each study, which undermines many of the advantages of diffuse optical methods, the use of registered atlases to model the individual's anatomy is becoming commonplace. Infant studies require carefully age-matched atlases because of the rapid growth and maturation of the infant brain. In this paper, we present a 4 D neonatal head model which, for each week from 29 to 44 weeks post-menstrual age, includes: 1) a <b>multi-layered</b> tissue <b>mask</b> which identifies extra-cerebral layers, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, white matter, cerebellum and brainstem, 2) a high-density tetrahedral head mesh, 3) surface meshes for the scalp, gray-matter and white matter layers and 4) cranial landmarks and 10 - 5 locations on the scalp surface. This package, freely available online at www. ucl. ac. uk/medphys/research/ 4 dneonatalmodel can be applied by users of near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse optical tomography to optimize probe locations, optimize image reconstruction, register data to cortical locations and ultimately improve the accuracy and interpretation of diffuse optical techniques in newborn populations...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{integrated}} circuits are fabricated {{with more and}} more devices existent on a unit area. Consequently, the inspection of such a complicated circuit poses a critical problem. A detailed visual inspection is the most effective method to screen out unreliable IC 2 ̆ 7 s. ^ But such a labor-intensive task is not suitable to be done by human operators. Also, the alignment and wire-bonding of integrated circuit are not yet fully automated. Consequently, the visual inspection process and the wire-bonding process constitute the bottle-neck of IC production. To automate these processes by means of pattern recognition and image processing techniques is a challenge. ^ A formulation of an automatic visual inspection and final packaging system is presented in this thesis. Such a system is composed of three subsystems: (1) the image segmentation and registration subsystem, (2) the visual inspection subsystem, and (3) the final packaging subsystem. The information within the visual inspection subsystem flows among three parts: (1) the visual inspection controller, (2) the design and inspection specification data base, and (3) the library of algorithms. The inspection controller decomposes the inspection job into smaller tasks. For each task, the controller activates a program fetched from the program library to operate on the sensed data by consulting the appropriate reference data. At the end of a task, the controller makes a decision of what to do next, depending on the result of the task. At last, the controller generates a report of the inspection and stops. ^ An integrated system for automatic visual inspection and wirebonding of {{integrated circuits}} is proposed in this thesis. The structure of such an integrated system follows the above general formulation. The functions of the image segmentation and registration subsystem include image segmentation, gross registration, and the microregistration of mask subpatterns. The input image S is first decomposed into the image W of the IC chip and the background. The gross registration of the IC chip is achieved by locating the mask frame. But since an IC image is a <b>multi-layer</b> image, each <b>mask</b> subpattern has to be micro-registered independently. The functions of the visual inspection subsystem include image transformation, detection and identification of IC defects, and classification. The idea of image transformation is to emphasize relevant information and to suppress irrelevant information. Furthermore, contextual information is made use of to remove ambiguity. Each IC defect is to be detected by an individual defect detector. Finally, the IC under inspection is classified into three classes: (1) accept, (2) reject, and (3) to be reworked. The final packaging subsystem solders an acceptable IC chip to the package substrate, detects the misregistration introduced during the soldering process, and then carries out the wire-bonding. ^ Such an integrated system proposed in this thesis is proved to be successful by experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|Extreme UV {{lithography}} is {{the leading}} top-down patterning technology {{for the development of}} semiconductor products beyond the traditional optica l lithography. It uses a Tin-based plasma to create photons at a wavelen gth of 13. 5 nm, an under vacuum reflective optical system (photomask inc luded) based on multilayers mirrors, and a highly absorbing photoresist t o create the desired pattern. Started in 1980, much {{progress has been made in}} order to drive this tech nology to the level of maturity required by the semiconductor industries to maintain the features scaling dictated by the non-natural law of Gor don Moore in 1965. Currently, the scaling is mostly driven by the revenu e coming from the lower cost per transistor at each new technology node. Each opportunity to introduce a new lithographic technique opens the do or for further cost-effective dimensional scaling, and extreme UV lithog raphy, characterized by a very short wavelength, providing tremendous re solution scalability. However, the introduction of this non-optical lith ography has been delayed for several years: it was meant to be ready for the sub- 100 nm technology nodes but currently it is still not sure if e xtreme Ultra-Violet lithography will be used for printing 16 / 14 nm featu res. Moreover, the introduction of alternative techniques such as nanoim print, mask-less lithography or bottom-up approaches based on direct ass embly of block-copolymers, makes the rush to scaling quite uncertain and absolutely exciting. Three major engineering challenges need to be addr essed simultaneously for a smooth introduction of extreme UV lithography into high volume manufacturing: [1] source power and reliability, [2] p hotomask readiness, and [3] photoresist performance. Generating extreme UV photons from a Tin plasma source has required new developments in mat erials for long lifetime and new optics for efficient collection of the clean in-band light. Furthermore, the requirement of such sources in ter ms of power is extremely high due to their extremely low conversion effi ciency during the generation of 13. 5 nm photons. The need of reflective optics puts a major burden on the mask industry by requiring a defect-fr ee generation of <b>multi-layer</b> coated <b>masks</b> with high degree of flatness t o allow a perfect in-phase reflection of the light towards the wafer. Fi nally, due to the feature dimensions, stochastic effects of a discrete w orld start playing a fundamental role in the definitions of the feature edges defined into the resist: line edge/width roughness and contact hol e uniformity. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to issue the resist pat tern randomness through a fundamental study of the root causes of variab ility creation during the lithographic exposures. Shot noise, due to the limited number of absorbed photons and generated acids per unit area, s peckle formation and mask roughness transfer on wafer, flare and stray l ight formation due to optics flatness, acid-base annihilation, aggregati on processes, polymer deprotection and development, are analyzed along t he lithographic process in order to quantify their contribution to the e dge misplacement for printed features on wafer. To properly measure and characterized the variability of the printed features, a quite extensive work has been dedicated to the understanding and setup of a proper metr ology, in particular on organic material, particularly delicate to measure without damaging. Furthermore, post-lithography processes aiming to m itigate this variability are studied and considered as valuable alternat ive to roughness reduction. At last, an electrical model for Flash memor y devices failure due to resist roughness, a joint project in collaborat ion with the PhD student Pavel Poliakov, is reported in order to underst and the impact of the resist roughness on device performance.
