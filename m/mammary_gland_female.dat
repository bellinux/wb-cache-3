40|$|The {{ability of}} {{interleukin}} (IL) - 12 to prevent tumors when administered to {{individuals with a}} genetic risk of cancer was studied in two lines of transgenic mice expressing rat HER- 2 /neu oncogene in the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland.</b> <b>Female</b> BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice carrying the activated HER- 2 / neu oncogene show no morphological abnormalities of the mammary gland until 3 wk of age. They then progress through atypical hyperplasia to in situ lobular carcinoma and at 33 wk of age all 10 mammary glands display invasive carcinomas. Adult FVB mice (H- 2 q) carrying the HER- 2 /neu protooncogene develop mammary carcinomas with a longer latency (38 - 49 wk) and a lower multiplicity (mean of 2. 6 tumors/mice).

40|$|Ethyl {{carbamate}} {{is found}} in fermented foods: bread contains 3 - 15 ng/g, stone-fruit brandies 200 - 20, 000 ngfg, and about one-third of table-wine samples analysed contained more than 10 ng/g. In animals, ethyl carbamate is degraded to C 02, H 20 and NH 3, with intermediate formation ofethanol. This degradation has been shown tobe inhibited (postponed) in the mouse by ethanol concentrations {{in the blood of}} about 0. 15 % and higher. A quantitatively minor pathway involves a two-step oxidation of the ethyl group to vinyl carbamate and epoxyethyl carbamate, the postulated electrophilic moiety that reacts with DNA. This reaction is probably the mode of the mutagenic action observed in many cellular and animal systems. The fact that only vinyl carbamate, but not ethyl carbamate, is mutagenic in a standard Ames test is probably because there is insufficient production of the intermediate oxidation product in the standard test. Consistent with this metabolism is the carcinogenic activity of ethyl carbamate in various animal species and in different organs; this activity can be seen even after a single high dose in early life. Quantitative analysis of the total tumour incidences after chronic exposure of rats and mice to 0. 1 - 12. 5 mg ethyl carbamate/kg body weightjday in the drinking-water showed a dose-related increase. The main target organs were the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> (<b>female</b> rats and mice having similar susceptibilities) and the Jung (mice only).

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells is promoted by estrogens. In contrast, androgens inhibit the proliferation of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. While this effect of androgens on breast cells appears to be androgen receptor (AR) dependent, the precise mechanism of inhibition and its functional significance are unknown. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effect of androgen signalling on growth of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells, and to assess the interactions between androgen and estrogen signalling in the breast. To investigate the role of androgen signalling in the growth {{and development of the}} normal <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> <b>female</b> mice were treated with either the native androgen 5 α- dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the antiandrogen, flutamide. Analysis of the mammary glands {{at the end of the}} treatment period demonstrated that DHT reduced ductal branching and mammary epithelial cell proliferation when treatment commenced mid-puberty. Conversely, flutamide treatment that commenced post-puberty significantly increased ductal branching and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. This data demonstrates that androgen signalling inhibits proliferation in the normal mammary gland, and may therefore oppose to the growth stimulatory effects of estrogen signalling to regulate breast growth and development. The antiproliferative effects of androgens on breast epithelial cells may be due in part to direct AR-mediated activation of androgen regulated genes, or alternatively, androgens could act indirectly through AR to inhibit estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity. Expression of fulllength AR or a truncated, constitutively active AR (AR-T 707) significantly inhibited the activity of ectopically expressed ERα in MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells (ERα- and ARnegative), in a dose-dependent manner. The functional consequences of inhibition of estrogen signalling by overexpressing AR were investigated in the T- 47 D breast cancer cell line (ERα- and AR-positive). Expression of AR-T 707 in T- 47 D cells resulted in inhibition of both basal and estradiol-induced cell proliferation and a marked reduction in the steady-state protein levels of the estrogen regulated gene, PR. The final chapter investigated the mechanism by which AR inhibits ERα activity. A coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated an interaction between ectopically expressed AR and ERα in COS- 1 cells, but not endogenous AR and ERα in a breast cancer cell line. To delineate the regions of AR required for inhibition of ERα signalling, various functional domains of the AR were mutated or deleted. Reporter gene assays showed that the inhibitory effects of AR were abrogated by deletion or mutation of the DNA binding domain (DBD). Furthermore, overexpression of the AR-DBD alone was sufficient to inhibit ERα activity. Consistent with a requirement for the DBD of AR to inhibit ERα activity, mobility shift assays demonstrated binding of AR to the Xenopus vitellogenin A 2 consensus estrogen response element (cERE); however AR/ERα heterodimers were not detected on a cERE. Consistent with these findings, molecular modelling demonstrated that it is feasible for the DBD of AR to bind to a cERE and that it is unlikely that AR/ERα heterodimers could bind. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated recruitment of AR to the promoters of endogenous estrogen regulated genes. The findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of AR on ERα activity may occur either via formation of non-functional AR/ERα heterodimers that are unable to bind to EREs, or AR homodimers competing effectively for binding to EREs, in ERα target genes. The results in this thesis demonstrate an inhibitory effect of androgen signalling on growth of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. Additionally, the inhibition of breast epithelial cell proliferation by androgen signalling can be attributed, at least in part, to inhibition of ERα activity. These studies have provided insight into androgen action in the breast, and support a model whereby androgens balance the stimulatory effects of estrogen signalling in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells.

40|$|Abstract. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is a routinely encountered but previously unreported {{feature of}} the normal rat <b>mammary</b> <b>gland.</b> Forty male and 40 female F 344 rats, 19 weeks of age, were examined retrospectively to document histologic differences that are very apparent when <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> {{of males and females}} of the same age are compared. Development of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> starts in utero, and there is reported to be little morphologic difference between males and females at birth. By 19 weeks of age, however, the differences are very noticeable. The <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of <b>females,</b> comprised of scattered tubular ducts and alveolar structures that have distinct lumina lined, usually, by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium, are characterized as tubuloalveolar. In young males, mammary tissue is generally more florid than in females of the same age.

The cells, arranged into alveoli, are generally characterized by abundant, foamy, eosin-ophilic cytoplasm containing distinct, variably-sized vacuoles. Alveolar lumina are mostly indistinct but may contain evidence of secretory activity.

During early lactation and mid-lactation, all lobes and lobules within the same gland had similar features; alveoli were well developed and distended and had a spherical to slightly ovoid structure, with muscular fibres grasping them around; inflammatory cells were seen in the inter- and intra-alveolar space; mammary lobules were separated with a scant amount of connective tissue.

At 10 weeks, secondary ducts had formed from the primary duct. By week 20, the gland had increased in volume and complexity, showing primitive lobules embedded in intralobular connective tissue disposed around main ducts. IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were expressed in cells of the intralobular connective tissue underlying the epithelium, while the IGF-I receptor was expressed in epithelium. Quantitation by absorbance measurements showed that mRNA expression increased with pregnancy stage for IGF-I and IGF-II, but not significantly for the IGF-I receptor, and that IGF-II was more highly expressed than IGF-I. A role for the IGF system in mediating mesenchymal–epithelial interactions in mammary development is indicated...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-Techniques {{developed}} for demonstrating hyperplastic lesions in <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of rodents {{were applied to}} whole <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of untreated <b>female</b> beagle dogs. Any unusual structural change, as com-pared to the normal lobularity of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> was considered an atypical nodule. Such nodules were classified histologically as normal, inflammatory, or proliferative. Evaluation of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> of the dog by the techniques described could substantially shorten the time re-quired and improve the accuracy of oncologic and drug evaluation studies. -J Nat Cancer Inst 47 : 1277 - 1287, 1971. IN MICE AND RATS, local hyperplasias exist which resemble the normal lobules of pregnancy, but occur in virgin or in nonpregnant, nonlactating, multiparous females. Certain of these localized areas recognized with dissecting microscope magni-fications were designated hyperplastic alveolar nodules and demonstrated to be preneoplastic (1, 2). The observation that a recognizable hyper-plastic lesion is the precursor of mammary tumor development in the mouse and the rat has prompted study of the dog to determine if similar lesions can be recognized in canine <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> The techniques {{for the study of}} the rodent's <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> although used to some extent in normal canine <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> studies (3), have not been applied to the investigation of canine mammary tumorigenesis and would seem to offer a means of scanning the entire <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> system for abnormalities. This study is an attempt to recognize by sub-gross morphology, with dissecting microscope magnifications, any abnormalities in the canine <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> and then to classify these struc-tures by histopathologic criteria...|$|R
40|$|AbstrAct There {{are many}} {{estrogen}} receptor α (ERα) antibodies available {{but few of}} them target a rodent ERα. Using the MC- 20 antibody raised against the C-terminus of mouse ERα, we show in this communication that in the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> of <b>female</b> mice and rats, the wild type (wt) ERα was detected on immunoblots as a dominant protein only during lactation, and the protein was lactating specific as it migrated slightly faster than the 67 -kD wt ERα in the uterus, likely due to a different phosphorylation status. In contrast, in the nulliparous, preg-nant, involuting and involuted <b>mammary</b> <b>glands,</b> the dominant protein recognized by MC- 20 was about 61 -kD, which is dubbed herein as “MC- 20 reactive protein ” or MC 20 RP in abbreviation as its identity is unknown. Our results showed {{that it was not}} derived from proteolysis or de-phosphorylation of the 67 -kD ERα and was unlikely to be translated from an ERα mRNA variant. Ovariectomy decreased the lactating specific wt ERα but increased the 61 -kD MC 20 RP in the mammary tumors from MMTV-c-myc transgenic mice but these two proteins in the uterus were unaffected. The 61 -kD MC 20 RP was decreased in the mammary tumors, compared with proliferating <b>mammary</b> <b>glands,</b> in estrogen-treated ACI rats. These results suggest that while the lactat-ing specific wt ERα alone or together with the MC 20 RP may sustain lactation, the MC 20 RP may support pro-liferation of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> and some <b>mammary</b> tumors.

50|$|A {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} the negative regulatory effects of the VDR on breast development may be indicated by a study of vitamin D3 supplementation in women which found that vitamin D3 suppresses cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the breast, and by doing so, reduces and increases, respectively, the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2), a known inhibitory factor in breast development. Moreover, suppression of PGE2 in breast tissue is relevant because, via activation of prostaglandin EP receptors, PGE2 potently induces amphiregulin expression in breast tissue, and activation of the EGFR by amphiregulin increases COX-2 expression in breast tissue, in turn resulting in more PGE2, and thus, a self-perpetuating, synergistic cycle of growth amplification due to COX-2 appears to potentially be present in normal breast tissue. Accordingly, overexpression of COX-2 in <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> tissue produces <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> hyperplasia as well as precocious <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development in <b>female</b> mice, mirroring the phenotype of VDR knockout mice, and demonstrating a strong stimulatory effect of COX-2, which is downregulated by VDR activation, on {{the growth of the}} <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> Also in accordance, COX-2 activity in the breasts {{has been found to be}} positively associated with breast volume in women.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-Primary tumors {{originating}} in the intermediate inguinal <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of <b>female</b> Buffalo rats were surgically "isolated " from the surrounding tissues, so that one artery and one vein were the only connection between host and tumor. The vein of this tumor was cannulated in situ and tumor blood was collected for several hours. The primary tumor was also removed from the host and perfused as an isolated, intact organ. -J Natl Cancer Inst 50 : 1381 - 1383, 1973. SOLID TUMORS studied in vivo as cell popula-tions constituting organoid structures must {{be separated from the}} host, but with their anatomic integrity and possibly physiologic behavior pre-served. A method was previously developed (1) for transplanting a tumor on the distal end of a pedicle obtained by isolating the ovarian artery and vein. The final preparation was a solid tumor growing in a subcutaneous pouch but separated from the surrounding tissues by a paraffin envelop...|$|R
