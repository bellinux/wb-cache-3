40|$|It is {{well known}} that slit (or sheared) coil edges have a great {{influence}} on the secondary rejection of the products that join both slit edges together by either electrical resistance welding or arc welding, such as tubes and pipes, as well as shells of pressure vessels. Unacceptable imperfections in the weld area have many causes. They could be attributed to improper equipment, improper operation or improper materials, or any combination of these. 1 To maintain dimensional tolerance and to avoid the failure to expel <b>mill</b> <b>edge</b> oxides into the beads scarfed off, both edges of narrow strips must be trimmed before the formin...|$|E

50|$|The $10 coin {{is made of}} two metals: a white nickel alloy {{outer ring}} and a brass inner core. The {{standard}} bauhinia on the obverse gives a sharp embossed image. The neat bonding between the outer and inner rings gives it another unique feature. The $10 coin has an alternate plain and <b>milled</b> <b>edge.</b> The $5 coin has a <b>milled</b> <b>edge.</b> A groove running within the <b>milled</b> <b>edging</b> contains raised English and Chinese characters, which read “Hong Kong Five Dollars”. The $1 and 50¢ coins have simple <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> The $2 and 20¢ coins have scalloped edges. The 10¢ coin has a plain edge. Under Hong Kong law (sections 98 - 102 of Cap. 200), anyone who makes or possesses or controls or passes any counterfeit note or coin commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for up to 14 years.|$|R

50|$|In modern {{practice}} in the United States, milling, or a <b>milled</b> <b>edge,</b> can refer to the raised edge on the coin face, applied by a special milling machine after the planchets are cut out and polished.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the edge sealing and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> and fog seal methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>milling</b> <b>edge</b> sealing and fog seal methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|R

"Debasement" [...] is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the tendency of silver or gold coins to be [...] "shaved", that is, to have small amounts shaved off the edges of the coins by unscrupulous users, thereby reducing the actual silver content of the coin. In order to prevent this, silver and gold coins began to be produced with <b>milled</b> <b>edges,</b> as many coins still do by tradition, although they no longer contain valuable metals. For example, the U.S. quarter and dime have <b>milled</b> <b>edges.</b> Coins that have traditionally been made purely of base metals, such as the U.S. nickel or the penny, {{are more likely to have}} unmilled edges.|$|R

40|$|The surface {{roughness}} of longitudinal milled birch wood samples {{as a function}} of main milling regimes such as <b>milling</b> tool <b>edge</b> blunt radius ρ (10 µm ÷ 40 µm), feed rate of milling tool uz (0. 5 mm ÷ 2. 0 mm) and milling tool cutting speed v (22. 4 m/s ÷ 40. 8 m/s) were investigated.
