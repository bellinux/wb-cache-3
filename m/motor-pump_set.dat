40|$|The {{optimization}} of a photovoltaic {{pumping system}} based on an induction motor driven pump that {{is powered by a}} solar array is presented in this paper. The motor-pump subsystem is analyzed {{from the point of view}} of optimizing the power requirement of the induction motor, which has led to an optimum u-f relationship useful in controlling the motor. The complete pumping system is implemented using a dc-dc converter, a three-phase inverter, and an induction <b>motor-pump</b> <b>set.</b> The dc-dc converter is used as a power conditioner and its duty cycle is controlled so as to match the load to the array. A microprocessor-based controller is used to carry out the load-matching...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{and renewable energy}} use are two main priorities leading to industrial sustainability nowadays according to European Steel Technology Platform (ESTP). Modernization efforts {{can be done by}} industries to improve energy consumptions of the production lines. These days, steel making industrial applications are energy and emission intensive. It was estimated that over the past years, energy consumption and corresponding CO 2 generation has increased steadily reaching approximately 338. 15 parts per million in august 2010 [1]. These kinds of facts and statistics have introduced {{a lot of room for}} improvement in energy efficiency for industrial applications through modernization and use of renewable energy sources such as solar Photovoltaic Systems (PV). The purpose of this thesis work is to make a preliminary design and simulation of the solar photovoltaic system which would attempt to cover the energy demand of the initial part of the pickling line hydraulic system at the SSAB steel plant. For this purpose, the energy consumptions of this hydraulic system would be studied and evaluated and a general analysis of the hydraulic and control components performance would be done which would yield a proper set of guidelines contributing towards future energy savings. The results of the energy efficiency analysis showed that the initial part of the pickling line hydraulic system worked with a low efficiency of 3. 3 %. Results of general analysis showed that hydraulic accumulators of 650 liter size should be used by the initial part pickling line system in combination with a one pump delivery of 100 l/min. Based on this, one PV system can deliver energy to an AC <b>motor-pump</b> <b>set</b> covering 17. 6 % of total energy and another PV system can supply a DC hydraulic pump substituting 26. 7 % of the demand. The first system used 290 m 2 area of the roof and was sized as 40 kWp, the second used 109 m 2 and was sized as 15. 2 kWp. It was concluded that the reason for the low efficiency was the oversized design of the system. Incremental modernization efforts could help to improve the hydraulic system energy {{efficiency and}} make the design of the solar photovoltaic system realistically possible. Two types of PV systems where analyzed in the thesis work. A method was found calculating the load simulation sequence based on the energy efficiency studies to help in the PV system simulations. Hydraulic accumulators integrated into the pickling line worked as energy storage when being charged by the PV system as well...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{alignment}} of rotating device has long ago {{been identified as}} a pre-requisite to safe and reliable uses. Loud noise levels, frequently vibrating floors, fiasco of bearings and lubrication system are the types of machine breakage that are the results of the shaft misalignment. To get efficient torque and hence power transfer, shaft alignment plays a crucial role like while connecting to a motor and pump in any kind of industrial usage. Achieving proper alignment involves far more than merely setting the machines so that the shafts remain coaxial. This involves the designing and implementation of devices and of the apparatus into which the equipment is integrated. Here, first we have worked on the importance as well as methods of the alignment and various type of misalignments and measuring it with several tools. To replicate the <b>motor-pump</b> <b>setting,</b> an experimental set up is constructed in a driver and a driven motor which are connected with each other by flange coupling. Proper shaft alignment is done with the help of different alignment devices and readings leading us to the efficiency of power transfe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:In {{urban areas}} {{the water supply}} to {{residence}} and commercial establishments are provided at a fixed flow rate. There are incidents of excess water drawing by certain customers/users by connecting <b>motor-pump</b> <b>sets</b> to the water lines which is considered as water theft. In this project it is proposed to develop an embedded based remote water monitoring and theft prevention system by recording the flow rates at the consumer/user end. In order to implement the proposed water supply system, each consumer end should be provided with an embedded based water flow monitoring system consisting of a microcontroller to record the flow rate using a flow sensor and to transmit the same to a remote monitoring station using wireless transmitter {{and it is also}} provided with an electrically operated solenoid valve to supply water to the consumers. The valve turns on/off by the central processing station PC to stop the water supply whenever the flow rate exceed a predefined limit. It is proposed to employ a GSM MODEM for wireless communication so that the information can be passed to many responsible officers cell phone for immediate action...|$|R
