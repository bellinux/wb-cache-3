40|$|Purpose: The {{quest for}} {{efficiency}} is {{claimed to be}} the major objective of port privatisation and this has led many ports in Africa to undertake port reforms. Based on this, Nigerian ports were concessioned and operations were handed over in one scoop to private operators between 2006 and 2007. This paper is looking to investigate in the reform that took place in {{a very short period of}} time improved the performance of Nigerian ports. This paper is also looking to provide a model for future evaluation. Research Approach: A window based DEA model with panel data will be employed to measure pre- and post concession Nigerian ports' performance to determine efficiency gains from port reform. Secondly, to demonstrate how concession influence efficiency, a DEA based Malmquist productivity Insex will be used to determine the sources of (in) efficiency by decomposing the efficiency into frontier shift effects and catch-up effects. Findings and Originality: The results revealed that none of the ports is hundred percent efficient before and after concession but rather a tremendous increase in throughput and ship traffic after the reform in most of the ports. Apapa port is the most efficient while Calabar and Warri are inefficient although there were fluctuations in efficiency in all the ports. The research is inconclusive because it is still ongoing Although some studies have investigated the relationship between port efficiency and privatisation however several gaps still exist as the studies are skewed in favour of container ports in the developed world, mainly in Europe. Therefore, the need arises to critically look at the overall efficiency of national port system to enhance the efficiency of global transport chain. Research Impact: The study will contribute to existing literature on port performance being the first to evaluate the post concession performance of a major <b>maritime</b> <b>player</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. It will contribute to the never- ending debate by the Academia on the effect of ownership or privatisation on efficiency from the perspective of port institutional reforms in the third world countries Practical Impact: It will benefit the Federal Government of Nigeria as a reference document of the first five years of the port reform policy and help the Government to intervene in areas of observed inefficiencies and make adjustments where possible. On the part of the "Landlord" NPA it will help them in the performing their regulatory role by identifying the operators who are making inefficient use of the resources allocated to them and provide the basis for future evaluation. Finally, it will give the various stake holders in the Maritime Industry a full grasp of the effect of concession in a Nation's port as Nigeria is the first country in the world to hand over terminal operations in all her ports in one scoop...|$|E
30|$|The Kra Canal {{issue has}} widely been {{discussed}} by <b>maritime</b> <b>players,</b> such as policy makers, regulators, and shipping and port operators. It {{seems that the}} idea of developing the Kra Canal is most welcome due to the great savings in costs, higher levels of safety and shortened distance compared to the journey via the Strait of Malacca. This phenomenon will most likely challenge the current maritime business activities in Malaysia because the total foreign going ships that call at the main ports are expected to be reduced. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} study the possible implications of the Kra Canal decision on the changes in maritime business patterns in Malaysia by focussing on the geographical aspects and logistics distribution. A descriptive analysis method will be used together with the PESTLES analysis in addressing the research objective. Finally, the positive and negative implications of the issue discussed are highlighted. Also, future maritime business strategies are proposed after taking into consideration the reshaping of the economies because of the accessibility of this new maritime route.|$|R
40|$|Voyager is an open-world shooter {{video game}} {{taking place in}} time periods crucial to the {{advancement}} of <b>maritime</b> warfare. The <b>player,</b> starting off as a small raft, sets off to discover how he can rebuild his ship to be better, faster, and stronger. Learning by defeating iconic enemies such as The Kraken, you�ll gather their remains and use them to create the ultimate naval ship ever to exist. Controlling your ship is simple. The WASD keys are used to maneuver your ship around the world, evading attacks left and right. To decimate your enemies, hover your mouse cursor over the enemy and unleash a barrage of right-clicks to fire. While your enemies can take a beating, you�ll only survive one shot to your hull so make your life count. While you dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge, remember the goal of Voyager: outlast the onslaught of enemy ships and boss ships, pilfering the remains of boss ships to create a behemoth of a ship. With every speed, hull, and weapon upgrade, you�re ship will grow, gaining the capabilities to travel to new lands and fight new enemies...|$|R
