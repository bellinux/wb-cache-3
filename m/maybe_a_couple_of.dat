Controversy arose when he said: [...] "You pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in Nebraska and you say 'OK, let it go' and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over, ballistic missiles {{in the middle of}} the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever”. He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes." [...] Adelson's spokesman told reporters that Adelson [...] "was obviously not speaking literally" [...] about using an atomic bomb in the desert, and that he was [...] "using hyperbole to make a point that … actions speak louder than words".|$|E

He might have pulled it off had it involved a substantial reinvention of himself and his style, courtesy of a currently hot producer. But, in opting for his trademark nasally vocals over the frantic beat {{that used to be}} called HiNRG, he seems to hove lost the plot - it's dance music's insatiable appetite for change that keeps it going, hence the unnaturally high casualty rate. Add to that the rather thin production values applied to Johnson’s music and it becomes obvious how much he needs the protection of a big surrounding sound. Here, what was previously suspect is strained, breathless and so badly controlled it's cruelly exposed as weak. Consequently, the only track that holds the attention is the ballad I Need Your Love - a clever combination of crisp beats and smooth strings. <b>Maybe</b> he's simply <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years past his sell-by date." ...|$|R

40|$|Mid January. I’m {{sitting on}} a train headed for London; {{opposite}} me, a colleague who sees almost as much Shakespeare in a year as I do. We're nattering about the ‘state of the art’. He says he’s fed up to the back teeth with ‘event’ Shakespeare. ‘Event’ Shakespeare? The kind of theatre he thinks we had too much of last year, productions aimed at some ‘event’ or other – ‘Globe to Globe’; the ‘World Shakespeare Festival’; both attached to the London Olympics – where the ‘event’ seemed to be what was driving and defining and selecting the Shakespeare on offer, rather than the creative energy and imagination of actors and directors and designers. The result for spectators was a number of productions that frequently didn't work on their own terms, productions that didn't {{have to work on}} their own terms, but only as bits and pieces fitting up the conceit of the big corporate project. He longs, he says wistfully, for productions that give us a whole vision of a play, the kind of Shakespeare that was standard at the RSC back in…(the date he offers is firmly in the last century). I say I saw a few ‘whole vision’ productions last year; most of them, it has to be said, independent of the frenzied corporate ‘event’-making. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> them, it’s true, had been officially ‘umbrella-ed’ by the sponsor but remained cockily resistant to wearing the corporate logo.
