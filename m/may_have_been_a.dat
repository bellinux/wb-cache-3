5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{deliberate}} invention {{on the part}} of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does make reference to Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fabrication {{on the part of}} Theoderic. Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|This {{building}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> later {{or second}} hospital. It {{is also possible}} that these ruins may have been part of St Erchard's Church - a.k.a. St Marys' or the Auld Kirk.|$|E

5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major {{exceptions to this}} are Hatzegopteryx, which was a robustly built raptorial predator of relatively large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> specialist molluscivore.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's {{influence}} in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> good tactician, {{but it was}} Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda {{was no longer a}} clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E

5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group.

5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain.

5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting that there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Roman settlement on the site.

5|$|In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov {{was charged}} by the Russian {{government}} with investigating Wallenberg's fate. He concluded that Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether, as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were brothers, {{or whether they}} shared the same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury.

50|$|Claraia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunistic}} genus {{that filled}} the niche of many benthic invertebrates such as brachiopods that were heavily impacted by the extinction. A narrowing of the byssal notch and a trend towards a smoother shell in species of Claria over time <b>may</b> <b>have</b> led to increased mobility. This increase in mobility <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> advantage over more sessile animals during the extinction event. It <b>is</b> thought to <b>have</b> lived in anoxic waters at great depths, and therefore <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> better adapted for the anoxic event that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> occurred during the Permian-Triassic extinction event.|$|R
