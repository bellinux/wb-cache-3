40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1990, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided more than $ 27 billion in disaster assistance, {{more than half of}} which was spent for public assistance projects, such as repairs of damaged roads, government buildings, utilities, and hospitals. FEMA uses established criteria to determine whether to (1) recommend that the President declare a disaster and (2) once a disaster has been declared, approve and fund Public Assistance projects. In 1999, FEMA published formal criteria for recommending the presidential approval of disaster declarations. These criteria include both <b>minimum</b> <b>financial</b> <b>thresholds</b> and other qualitative measures that FEMA applies in deciding whether to recommend presidential approval. These criteria do not necessarily indicate a state's ability to pay for the damage because they do not consider the substantial differences in states' financial capacities to respond when disasters occur. As a result, federal funds may be provided for some disasters when they are not needed. Problems with applying FEMA's criteria remain. In part, these problems may persist because many of the staff assigned to disaster field offices who make eligibility decisions are temporary and may not have the skills and training needed to make appropriate decisions. FEMA has developed a credentialing program to establish qualifications and training requirements for these staff but has not implemented this program. FEMA officials said that budgetary and programmatic factors have delayed implementation. In addition, FEMA's review process does not ensure that all projects are reviewed by the most knowledgeable officials. FEMA also lacks centralized, quantified information that would be helpful for managing the Public Assistance program. Its information system [...] essentially an electronic filing cabinet [...] stores information project by project and does not provide effectively for programwide analysis. Furthermore, the system is unreliable and difficult to use, according to FEMA officials. As a result, data are lost or never entered. ...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Our work on the outcomes of the CBP round 1 rebid found {{that the number of}} bidding suppliers and the number of contracts awarded in the CBP round 1 rebid were very similar to the CBP round 1 and {{about a third of the}} 1, 011 suppliers that bid in the rebid were awarded at least one CBP contract. CMS made improvements to the bidding process for the CBP round 1 rebidsuch as providing additional information about disqualification reasonsand significantly fewer bids were disqualified than in round 1. However, many suppliers still had difficulty meeting bid requirements. Of the bids that were disqualified during the initial bid review, 73 percent were disqualified because suppliers failed to provide the required financial documentation or did not meet CMSs <b>minimum</b> <b>financial</b> standard <b>threshold</b> for suppliers. The number of bids disqualified for missing financial documentation in the CBP round 1 rebid would have been higher if many suppliers had not benefited from a MIPPA provision that required that CMS provide suppliers the opportunity to be notified of and to submit missing required financial documentationa process not available during CBP round 1. As a result, 93 of the 321 suppliersabout 29 percentthat were notified by CMS that they had missing financial documentation, and subsequently provided correct documentation, were ultimately awarded one or more CBP contracts. In the CBP round 1 rebid, as in CBP round 1, CMS determined that some suppliers bids had been disqualified incorrectly. CMS told us it received bid inquiries from 99 suppliers that had bids disqualified in the CBP round 1 rebid and subsequently extended contracts to 7 of those suppliers that were found to have incorrectly disqualified bids. ...|$|R
