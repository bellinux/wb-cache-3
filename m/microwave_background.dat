5|$|Microwave space telescopes have {{primarily}} {{been used}} to measure cosmological parameters from the Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background.</b> They also measure synchrotron radiation, free-free emission and spinning dust from our Galaxy, as well as extragalactic compact sources and galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{is moving}} {{with respect to}} the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> {{radiation}} (CMB) {{in the direction of the}} constellation Hydra with a speed of 550km/s, and the Sun's resultant velocity {{with respect to the}} CMB is about 370km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} neutral atoms formed from {{a sea of}} {{primordial}} ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age {{due to the lack}} of stellar energy sources.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, {{the first}} {{results of the}} Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) were released, {{yielding}} what were {{at the time the}} most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models, but are consistent with the inflation theory in general. The Planck space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> experiments are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, {{of which}} the Observatory is a part, {{is one of the}} largest {{astrophysics}} research groups in the UK. About half of the research of the group is in the area of radio astronomy—including research into pulsars, the Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background</b> Radiation, gravitational lenses, active galaxies and astrophysical masers. The group also carries out research at different wavelengths, looking into star formation and evolution, planetary nebulae and astrochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect is}} very small but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E
5|$|There is {{an active}} {{development}} programme researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory {{has been involved in}} the construction of several Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background</b> experiments, including the Tenerife Experiment, which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the Very Small Array. It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44GHz receivers for the Planck spacecraft. Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the Parkes Telescope in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> {{radiation}} on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Observations of the {{large-scale}} {{structure of the}} Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang {{can be traced back to}} the discovery of the <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, {{and became the first}} persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background,</b> and images of gravitational lensing. Her research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of AMiBA is to observe both the {{temperature}} and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background</b> at multipoles between 800 and 8,000 (corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky), as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, which has a maximum decrement around 100GHz. In its initial configuration, it measures up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes. The telescope only observes at night during good weather, using planets for calibration.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, {{and the effects of}} gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
25|$|Observations of {{the cosmic}} <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> suggest that neutrinos do not {{interact}} with themselves.|$|E
25|$|Two other effects which {{occurred}} between reionization and our {{observations of the}} cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background,</b> and which appear to cause anisotropies, are the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the Sachs–Wolfe effect, which causes photons from the Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background</b> to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.|$|E
25|$|Harrison, Peebles, Yu and Zel'dovich {{realized}} that the early universe {{would have to have}} inhomogeneities at the level of 10−4 or 10−5. Rashid Sunyaev later calculated the observable imprint that these inhomogeneities would have on the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background.</b> Increasingly stringent limits on the anisotropy of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> were set by ground based experiments during the 1980s. RELIKT-1, a Soviet cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> anisotropy experiment on board the Prognoz 9 satellite (launched 1 July 1983) gave upper limits on the large-scale anisotropy. The NASA COBE mission clearly confirmed the primary anisotropy with the Differential Microwave Radiometer instrument, publishing their findings in 1992. The team received the Nobel Prize in physics for 2006 for this discovery.|$|E
25|$|High-energy {{radio waves}} {{are known as}} {{microwaves}} {{and this has been}} an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation in 1964. Many ground-based radio telescopes can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The Cosmic Background Explorer (1989) revolutionized the study of the <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation.|$|E
25|$|The average {{temperature}} of the universe today is approximately , based on measurements of cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation.|$|E
25|$|South Pole Telescope (2007–present), used {{to survey}} the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> (CMB) to look for distant galaxy clusters.|$|E
25|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe mapped the Cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> {{radiation}} in 5 different frequency bands, {{centered on}} 23GHz, 33GHz, 41GHz, 61GHz, and 94GHz.|$|E
25|$|January 1992 – Scientists that {{analysed}} {{data from}} the RELIKT-1 report the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> at the Moscow astrophysical seminar.|$|E
25|$|A {{new study}} of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> has looked back to within 100,000 years of the Big Bang, the furthest that has yet been observed.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the photon–baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2010, NASA's WMAP {{spacecraft}} took {{very detailed}} {{pictures of the}} universe {{by means of the}} cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the Lambda-CDM model and the inflationary theory are correct. No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background,</b> the observed higher abundance of active galactic nuclei in the early universe and the observed masses of clusters of galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Zel'dovich {{worked on}} {{the theory of the}} {{evolution}} of the hot universe, the properties of the <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the theory of black holes. He predicted, with Rashid Sunyaev, that the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> should undergo inverse Compton scattering. This is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and measurements by telescopes such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope has established it as one of the key observational probes of cluster cosmology. Zel'dovich contributed sharp insights into the nature of the large scale structure of the universe, in particular, through the use of Lagrangian perturbation theory (the Zel'dovich approximation) and the application of the Burgers' equation approach via the adhesion approximation.|$|E
25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the small irregularities (anisotropies) in the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background.</b> Observations by WMAP and Planck indicate that around five-sixths of the total matter is {{in a form that}} interacts significantly with ordinary matter or photons only through gravitational effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{year earlier}} it {{appeared}} LIGO {{might have been}} beaten to the punch when the BICEP2 claimed that they had detected the imprint of gravitational waves in the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background.</b> However, they were later forced retract their result.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} structure of DNA {{was discovered in}} 1953. The discovery of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation in 1964 led to {{a rejection of the}} Steady State theory of the universe in favour of the Big bang theory of Georges Lemaître.|$|E
25|$|In cosmology, {{the cosmic}} <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> {{radiation}} CMB {{is a form}} of electromagnetic radiation filling the universe. The CMB's discovery in 1964 by astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, earning them a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{greatest}} successes of the Big Bang theory are its prediction of the almost perfect black body spectrum and its detailed prediction of the anisotropies in the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background.</b> The CMB spectrum {{has become the most}} precisely measured black body spectrum in nature.|$|E
25|$|Dust {{is widely}} {{present in the}} galaxy. Ambient {{radiation}} heats dust and re-emits radiation into the microwave band, which may distort the cosmic <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> power spectrum. Dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum, and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission.|$|E
