40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking are highly predictive of smoking in middle school children. Three factors <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking have been suggested in the literature: personal meanings, functional meanings, and social meanings. These conceptually derived factors <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking have not previously been empirically studied. Purpose: This study examined the factor structure <b>of</b> the <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> Smoking Index (MSI) to determine the unique contribution <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking and positive outcome expectancies to smoking behavior in middle school children. Methods: A multiethnic sample of 2, 247 eighth-grade students enrolled in 24 middle schools in greater Los Angeles completed a paper-and-pencil survey in class. Results: Four factors of the MSI emerged (functional, personal, social image, and weight concern). Positive outcome expectancies and each of the four factors of the MSI predicted lifetime smoking in a multivariate model. Conclusions: <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking were empirically distinct from positive outcome expectancies. Adolescents who endorsed personal and functional meanings were more likely to smoke. Social image and weight concern meanings were negatively related to smoking after controlling for all other <b>meanings.</b> <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking may prove to be important and modifiable mediators of smoking and therefore useful in future prevention studies...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to describe: (1) Modalverben constructions in German {{sentences}}, (2) <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> Modalverben in German sentences, and (3) equivalences of Modalverben in German {{sentences in}} Indonesian. This was a qualitative descriptive study. The objects {{of the research}} data were lingual units of modality constructions with objective and subjective meanings in both German phrases and sentences. The subjects of the data were modal verbs in German sentences. The data sources were the magazine NADI Indonesia Deutsch 2012 and 2013. The data were collected by means of reading and noting techniques and analyzed {{by means of the}} translational, equivalent, and distributional techniques. The data validity was assessed through the semantic validity and the inter-rater and intra-rater techniques. The research findings are as follows. (1) the objektive Modalverben construction in German is S - Inf+Modalverb and the subjektive Modalverben construction is S+Inf – Modalverb. (2) <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> objektive Modalverben are those which are loose in nature because because lexical elements of modality can reveal utterance contents while <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> subjektive Modalverben are those outside lexical elements because they are affected by speakers’ subjective intentions. (3) The equivalences of objektive und subjektive Modalverben in German sentences in Indonesian are in the form Modalverb können appearing 107 times, equivalent to <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> dapat, bisa, ada, menjadi, berhasil, mampu, meraih, terdiri, sungguh, and makna zero. Modalverb dürfen (8) are equivalent to <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> dapat, boleh, and makna zero. Modalverb sollen (27) are equivalent to <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> harus, akan, bisa, seharusnya, perlu, dan makna zero. Modalverb wollen (3) are equivalent to <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> ingin, terus terang, and makna zero.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of working memory capacity, access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> L 1 homonyms and degree of cross-language activation on the access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> L 2 homonyms. In Experiment 1, Spanish-English bilinguals completed a word recognition task which assessed how quickly and accurately they accessed subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> English homonyms that were either noncognates (e. g. fast/ rápido) or cognates (e. g. letter/letra) with Spanish. In Experiment 2, another group of Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences while having their eye-movements recorded for measures of lexical access. On the critical trials, sentences contained a homonym that was either a noncognate (e. g. fast/rápido) or cognate with Spanish (e. g. letter/letra). The context preceding the target word (i. e. homonym) was either biased to the subordinate meaning or neutral. General analyses from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> cognate homonyms was facilitated compared to access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> noncognate homonyms. Analyses of the individual differences factors revealed that access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> L 1 homonyms was the most consistent predictor of access to subordinate <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> L 2 homonyms. These findings are discussed in terms of how these individual differences should be taken into account to better model the dynamics of bilingual lexical disambiguation. ...|$|R

40|$|Educational {{experience}} influences <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy for African American college students. <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy impact individual {{reading and}} writing performance and methods of acquisition. Prior to entering college, some African American students receive {{reading and writing}} instruction focused primarily on vocabulary building {{and the construction of}} summaries related to the text. These educational experiences produce in African American students <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy characterized by memorization, summarization, and retelling of facts. Consequently, upon entering college some African American students under perform on literacy tasks, where text analysis, active problem solving, and critical thinking are used. ^ This research uses phenomenological interviewing to examine <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy for six first-year African American college students as they transition into college-level English courses. Findings reveal that <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy evolve as African American college students experience literature in the college classroom. Changes in <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy also impacted student performance in the college English classroom. Specific instructional experiences in college-level English classroom allowed these students to recognize literacy as complex interactions between texts, personal experience, and sociocultural influences. Factors of culturally sensitive instruction in the college classroom were found to influence the six first-year African American students 2 ̆ 7 <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> literacy. These factors included: content integration, knowledge construction, equity pedagogy, prejudice reduction, opportunities for empowerment and critical thinking, and community integration.

40|$|Polysemy, or the {{association}} {{of two or more}} related meanings with a single linguistic form (Taylor, 1995, p. 99), is ubiquitous in language and receives attention from many linguistic disciplines. Cognitive linguists interpret the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> polysemous words based on conventional conceptual structures, as the identification of polysemy involves the conceptualization of everyday life. Based on the principles of cognitive linguistics, this study analyzes polysemy through an in-depth examination of Chinese body-part terms, namely tou „head‟ and yan „eye‟, in order to unfold the internal relationships among the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> polysemous words. According to the findings, first, the original or literal <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> body-part terms tou „head‟ and yan „eye‟ refer to the body parts „head‟ and „eye‟. Each body-part term is composed of various related meanings; among these are a prototypical or literal meaning and peripheral or extended meanings. Second, the formation <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> each body-part term is a process of category extension, and metaphor and metonymy are two important cognitive mechanisms for category extension. Third, this study analyzes the structural patterns of literal and extended <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> tou „head‟ and yan „eye‟. The <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> each body-part term are associated with different parts of speech, establishing highly entrenched structural patterns to directly differentiate literal and extended <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> each body-part term. Based on the cognitive-linguistic analysis of Chinese body-part terms, the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> a polysemous word are closely related and form a prototype-based semantic network. However, the polysemous meanings have few attributes in common and have their own representations respectively. Also, they are not interpreted independently but are contextually modulated. A cognitive-linguistic study of Chinese body-part terms will offer insight into the internal construction of polysemy, foster better understanding <b>of</b> various <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> Chinese body-part terms, and benefit communication among speakers who take Chinese as a native or foreign language.

5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs.
