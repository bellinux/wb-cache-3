The Report of the President 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, titled 2 ̆ 2 Simple, Fair, and Pro-Growth, 2 ̆ 2 was issued Nov 1, 2005.

(2010) used sheets fabricated from a single manufacturer (FRP system M) and (McGuirk and Breña 2012) used sheets from two different manufacturers (FRP systems F and S). Unidirectional carbon fiber sheets bonded formed by wet layup were used in all cases. The published tensile strength, rupture strain, and elastic modulus of a 1 -ply cured fiber-reinforced sheet from manufacturer M are 830  MPa, 1.67  %, and 49.3 GPa, respectively. Similarly the published tensile strength, rupture strain, and modulus of a 1 -ply cured sheet from <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> are 849  MPa, 70.5  GPa, and 1.12  %; and those for manufacturer F are 875  MPa, 72.4  GPa, and 1.2  %, respectively.

40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{indicates that}} newly available portable hand-held x-ray units provide advantages compared to traditional fixed properly installed and operated x-ray units in dental radiography. However, concern that hand-held x-ray units produce higher operator doses than fixed x-ray units has caused regulatory agencies to mandate requirements {{for use of}} hand-held units that go beyond those recommended by the manufacturer and can discourage {{the use of this}} technology. To assess the need for additional requirements, a hand-held x-ray unit and a pair of manikins were used to measure the dose to a simulated operator under two conditions: exposures made according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>recommendations</b> and exposures made according to manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>recommendation</b> except for the removal of the x-ray unit 2 ̆ 7 s protective backscatter shield. Dose to the simulated operator was determined using an array of personal dosimeters and a pair of pressurized ion chambers.
