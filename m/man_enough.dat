500|$|Haley {{writes that}} during {{the last months of}} MalcolmX's life [...] "uncertainty and confusion" [...] about his views were {{widespread}} in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible." [...] MalcolmX had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology {{at the time of his}} assassination and, Dyson writes, was [...] "experiencing a radical shift" [...] in his core [...] "personal and political understandings".|$|E
500|$|Goebel took a {{calculated}} risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now {{be able to}} secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced {{the man with the}} lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their <b>man.</b> <b>Enough</b> of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the [...] "Honest Election Democrats" [...] held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor.|$|E

500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] {{was written}} by Timbaland, Jerome [...] "J-Roc" [...] Harmon, Keri Hilson and Timothy [...] "Attitude" [...] Clayton. In an {{interview}} with Ian Drew of DailyFill, Hilson explained that inspiration for writing the song came from women's experiences, including [...] "being lied to and tolerating too much" [...] from their partner. She elaborated on its theme during a radio interview, stating: [...] "The song is about that breaking point that every woman gets to when the excuses given by boys are no longer accepted. If you're not <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to step to the plate, then keep it moving." [...] The song shares its theme with [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] as both songs are about [...] "women {{coming to terms with}} what they need from a relationship". The [...] "powerful" [...] meaning of the two songs was personal to Hilson and she hoped that it would have the same effect on listeners.

2500|$|After the 2008 general {{election}} which saw heavy losses for BN, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet. Within {{days of his}} appointment, new de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim stated {{that the government had}} to openly apologise for its handling of the crisis, calling it one of his three main goals: [...] "In the eyes of the world, the judicial crisis has weakened our judiciary system." [...] However, he rejected the idea of reviewing the decision: [...] "I am not suggesting that we re-open the case. I am saying that it’s clear to everyone, to the world, that serious transgressions had been committed by the previous administration. And I believe that the prime minister is big enough and <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to say that we had done wrong to these people and we are sorry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the results}} of these {{gravitational}} wave experiments were largely discredited, although Weber continued to argue that he had detected gravitational waves. [...] In order to test Weber's results, IBM Physicist Richard Garwin built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's. In six months, it detected only one pulse, which was most likely noise. David Douglass, another physicist, had discovered an [...] in Weber's computer program that, he claimed, produced the daily gravitational wave signals that Weber claimed to have detected. Because of the error, a signal seemed to appear out of noise. Garwin aggressively confronted Weber with this information at the Fifth Cambridge Conference on Relativity at MIT in June 1974. A series of letters was then exchanged in Physics Today. Garwin asserted that Weber's model was [...] "insane, because the universe would convert all of its energy into gravitational radiation in 50 million years or so, if one were really detecting what Joe Weber was detecting." [...] "Weber," [...] Garwin , [...] "is just such a character that he has not said, 'No, I never did see a gravity wave.' And the National Science Foundation, unfortunately, which funded that work, is not <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to clean the record, which they should." [...] In 1972, Heinz Billing and colleagues at Max Planck Institute for Physics built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's to verify his claim but found no results.|$|E
2500|$|David Buckingham, {{author of}} Public Secrets: EastEnders and its Audience, has {{discussed}} the writers use of Pete, specifically to show masculinity in an innovative way - as a problem. He suggested that with Pete, the programme questioned the traditional definition of masculinity: [...] "Pete clearly regards {{himself as a}} 'real man' and as 'the boss' of his family [...] He also feels he {{is an expert on}} women [...] on the other hand, however, Pete's masculine self-image has been repeatedly undermined. The arrival of his ex-wife Pat Wicks , for example, provided a view of Pete which had not hitherto been heard in the serial: she told Pauline that Pete was 'boring, selfish and terrible in bed', and went on to torment him by revealing that he was not in fact the father of his son Simon - 'you're not <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to make Simon'." [...] Buckingham also suggests that Pete was also publicly humiliated on a number of occasions, with the most [...] "remarkable example" [...] being shown in 1987, after he was victim to a practical joke and attended an alleged cross-dressing party at The Queen Victoria public house as the only person in full drag. The episode ended with a close-up of Pete's [...] "tear-stained, luridly made-up face". Buckingham suggested that Pete's definition of his own masculinity regularly came into question in the serial, and the connection between masculinity and violence - shown occasionally with Pete - [...] "far from being celebrated, has been seen as a problem".|$|E

2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't <b>man</b> <b>enough</b> to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty <b>man</b> <b>enough,</b> with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E
