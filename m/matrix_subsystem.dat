For development and testing of navigation receivers utilizing these techniques for improved signal reception, here summarized as receivers with controlled reception pattern antennas (CRPA), special GNSS signal generators are {{required in order to}} generate the signals as seen by each antenna element correctly in phase and amplitude. The paper describes a new GNSS satellite signal simulator especially developed for DLR by Spirent that is capable of generating individual GPS and Galileo satellite signals for testing of receivers with CRPA. The simulator will be combined and synchronized with an additional hardware matrix developed by DLR, which produces a planar wavefront, i. e. the signals seen by each element of an antenna array depending on the direction of arrival of individual satellite signals. The features of the new satellite signal generator, the principals of signal generation, the theoretical background for wave front generation, the synchronization between the satellite signal simulator and the <b>matrix</b> <b>subsystem,</b> and finally, the application of the complete simulation system for receiver and antenna testing are presented...|$|E

First, {{the influence of the}} mutual orientation of the poling direction of the single-crystal and ceramic components on the properties of the 1 – 0 – 3 composite is discussed to demonstrate advantages concerned with the high hydrostatic piezoelectric performance and large anisotropy of squared figures of merit. In a 1 – 0 – 3 0. 67 Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 − 0. 33 PbTiO 3 single crystal/ (Pb 1 –xCax) TiO 3 ceramic/araldite composite with x = 0. 20 – 0. 25, values of max g_ h * 102 mV · m/N and max(d_ hg_ h) * 10 − 11 Pa− 1 are achieved at specific volume-fraction and rotation-angle ranges due to the new orientation effect {{in the presence of a}} highly anisotropic 0 – 3 matrix. Second, the influence of the aspect ratio of ceramic inclusions on the piezoelectric and hydrostatic parameters of the 1 – 0 – 3 composite based on relaxor-ferroelectric SCs is studied. In this case, the elastic anisotropy of the 0 – 3 matrix plays the key role in forming the large effective parameters of the composite.

40|$|Modeling of wave {{scattering}} from grating couplers {{has become}} increasingly important due to extensive recent research interest in the problem of plasmonic resonance. Computational algorithms which are specially used to model the problem of scattering from the grating surfaces suffer from several drawbacks such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and generality. To address {{the challenges of the}} previous methods, this work presents a novel hybrid Finite Element-Boundary Integral Method (FE-BIM) {{solution to the problem of}} scattering from grating surfaces consisting of finite or infinite array of two-dimensional cavities and holes in an infinite metallic walls covered with a stratified dielectric layer. To solve the scattering problem from finite number of cavities or holes engraved in a perfectly conducting screen (PEC), the solution region is divided into interior regions containing the cavities or holes and the region exterior to them. The finite element formulation is applied inside the interior region to derive a linear system of equations associated with nodal field values. Using two-boundary formulation, the surface integral equation employing free-space Green's function is then applied at only the opening of the cavities or holes to truncate the computational domain and to connect the <b>matrix</b> <b>subsystem</b> generated from each cavity or hole. The hybrid FE-BIM method is extended to solve the scattering problem from an infinite array of cavities or holes in a PEC screen by deriving the quasi-periodic Green's function. In the scattering problem from an infinite array of cavities, the finite element formulation is first used inside a single cavity in the unit-cell. Next, the surface integral equation employing the quasi-periodic Green's function is applied at the opening of only a single cavity as a boundary constraint to truncate the computational domain. Effect of the infinite array of cavities is incorporated into the system of the nodal equations by the quasi-periodic Green's function. Finally, the method based on the hybrid FE-BIM is developed to solve the scattering problem from grating surfaces covered with a stratified dielectric layer. In this method, the surface integral equation employing grounded dielectric slab Green's function is applied at the opening of the cavities or holes inside the dielectric coating to truncate the solution region efficiently. An accurate algorithm is presented to derive the grounded dielectric slab Green's function in spatial domain incorporating the effects of the surface-waves and leaky-waves excited and propagated inside the dielectric slab. Numerical examples of near and far field calculations for finite or infinite array of cavities or holes are presented to validate accuracy, versatility, and efficiency of the algorithm presented in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the class of discrete-time switched systems switching between p autonomous positive subsystems. First, sufficient conditions for testing stability, based {{on the existence of}} special classes of common Lyapunov functions, are investigated, and these conditions are mutually related, thus proving that if a linear copositive common Lyapunov function can be found, then a quadratic positive definite common function can be found, too, and this latter, in turn, ensures the existence of a quadratic copositive common function. Secondly, stabilizability is introduced and characterized. It is shown that if these systems are stabilizable, they can be stabilized by means of a periodic switching sequence, which asymptotically drives to zero every positive initial state. Conditions for the existence of state-dependent stabilizing switching laws, based on the values of a copositive (linear/quadratic) Lyapunov function, are investigated and mutually related, too. Finally, some properties of the patterns of the stabilizing switching sequences are investigated, and the relationship between a sufficient condition for stabilizability (the existence of a Schur convex combination of the <b>subsystem</b> <b>matrices)</b> and an equivalent condition for stabilizability (the existence of a Schur matrix product of the <b>subsystem</b> <b>matrices)</b> is explored...|$|R
