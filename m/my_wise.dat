2500|$|Darwin {{decided to}} leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began Recollections of the Development of my mind and character. He found this candid private memoir easy going, {{covering}} his childhood, university, life on the Beagle expedition and developing work in science. A section headed [...] "Religious Belief" [...] opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. At first he had been unwilling {{to give up his}} faith, and had tried to [...] "invent evidence" [...] supporting the Gospels, but just as his clerical career had died a slow [...] "natural death", so too did his belief in [...] "Christianity as a divine revelation". [...] "Inward convictions and feelings" [...] had arisen from natural selection, as had survival instincts, and could not be relied on. He was quick to show Emma's side of the story and pay tribute to [...] "your mother,... so infinitely my superior in every moral quality... <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> adviser and cheerful comforter".|$|E

6000|$|... "A fancy, then, <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> pet," [...] said Mr. Lorry, {{patting her}} hand. [...] "They are very {{numerous}} and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because--I {{will tell}} you after. But this I say, my curse on the {{grandson}} of mine who shall try to seize that fatal crown, which cost the life of my fairest, <b>my</b> noblest, <b>my</b> <b>wisest,</b> <b>my</b> bravest!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wisest</b> {{policy was}} to remain downstairs when these {{withering}} blasts were blowing, but probably I {{went up in}} self-defence.|$|R
60|$|Now was Christian {{somewhat}} at a stand; but presently he concluded, if this be true, {{which this}} gentleman hath said, <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> course {{is to take}} his advice; and with that he thus further spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would, my good man," [...] {{retorted}} the Duchesse, [...] "but <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> counsels {{would benefit}} no one now, seeing {{that you have}} been sent on a fool's errand." ...|$|E
6000|$|I know it, <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> and {{economical}} friends. The stout arms God gave you to win your bread by, you would fain shoot your neighbours--and God's sweet singers--with;[119] then you invoke the friends to your farm-service, and-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "all {{we can do}} is to {{walk down}} to the car, and let them follow; and, meanwhile, I will give you <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> opinion about this {{education}} question, whereof I know nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now was Christian {{somewhat}} at a stand; but presently he concluded, [...] "If this be true {{which this}} gentleman hath said, <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> course {{is to take}} his advice;" [...] and with that, he thus further spake: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was an old}} farm-house, he told me, on {{the other}} side of the park, and near it a few cottages--at the far end of Loose Lane. He lodged in one of these. Against <b>my</b> <b>wiser</b> inclinations he persuaded me to set off thither at once and see the farm for myself.|$|R
50|$|For {{my parents}} were noble, and <b>my</b> grandfathers,:The <b>wise</b> Balbillus and Antiochus the king.|$|R
6000|$|I know it, <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> and {{economical}} friends. The stout arms God gave you to win your bread by, you would fain shoot your neighbours, and God's sweet singers with;[87] then you invoke the fiends to your farm-service; and-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could think}} <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> brother Maurice had been cautioning you,' said Albinia, taking leave as {{of an old}} friend, for indeed she felt more at home with Mrs. Dusautoy than with any {{acquaintance}} she had made in Bayford.|$|E
6000|$|As for {{the rest}} of my acts, and my wars, and all <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> sayings, and why my mare was called Jenny Geddes, they shall be {{recorded}} in a few weeks hence at Linlithgow, in the chronicles of your memory, by ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, if Corrie {{sides with}} you I feel that <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> course is to submit. And now, Henry," [...] said Gascoyne, {{resuming}} his wonted gravity of tone and demeanour, [...] "sit {{down here and}} let me know where we are going to and what you mean to do. It is natural that I should feel curious on these points even although I have perfect confidence in you all." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, Pamela, after {{thinking}} it {{over for a}} day or so, I came near inquiring about a state-room in our ship for Sam, to please you, but <b>my</b> <b>wiser</b> former resolution came back to me. It is not for his good that he have friends in the ship. His conduct in the Bacon business shows that he will develop rapidly into a manly man as soon as he is cast loose from your apron strings.|$|R
60|$|I rose once more. It {{could serve}} no good purpose to linger until night by {{the banks of}} the river. I had left the house, feeling the impulse which drives us, in certain excited {{conditions}} of the mind, to take refuge in movement and change. The remedy had failed; my mind was as strangely disturbed as ever. <b>My</b> <b>wisest</b> course would be to go home, and keep my good mother company over her favorite game of piquet.|$|R
6000|$|It was then, when I laughed, that visions, dreams, memories, {{were put}} to flight, for <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> sister was {{studying}} my face, and now, putting her hand on mine, she said, [...] "Listen!" [...] And I listened, sadly, since I could guess what was coming.|$|E
6000|$|She {{coloured}} as she {{pronounced the}} last words, and hastily left the apartment. When {{she was in}} her own chamber, she dismissed her other attendants and retained Rose. [...] "What dost thou think of these things, <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> maiden and monitress?" [...] said she.|$|E
60|$|While {{speaking}} she tremblingly pulled out, and put on, {{a pair of}} spectacles {{to enable}} her to have a clearer view of her visitors. The scene that immediately followed took me very much by surprise, and completely frustrated all <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> plans of caution.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped to}} admire a fine pair of stag's antlers. The footman coughed impatiently. I still lingered, hearing the doctor's {{footsteps}} ascending the stairs. They suddenly stopped; {{and then there}} was a low heavy clang, like the sound of a closing door made of iron, or of some other unusually strong material; then total silence, interrupted by another impatient cough from the workman-like footman. After that, I thought <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> proceeding would be to go away before my mysterious attendant was driven to practical extremities.|$|R
5000|$|On {{that day}} my father, an {{accomplished}} artist and architect, {{took his own}} life. He had always been my greatest inspiration, <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> confidant, <b>my</b> biggest fan, and my best friend. He was insanely talented, amazingly kind, and aggressively charming. But most of all, although we played in different mediums, he was my artistic soul mate. Somehow, {{with him in the}} world, it was easier to [...] a life in the ridiculous pursuit of artistic endeavors. Being totally and completely understood by someone has a way of dissolving self-doubt into bite size pieces.|$|R
6000|$|Now, I hear <b>my</b> <b>wisest</b> {{and most}} {{critical}} neighbour remark, [...] "Mr. Croftangry {{is in the}} way of doing a foolish thing, He is well to pass--Old Fairscribe knows to a penny what he is worth, and Miss Katie, with all her airs, may like the old brass that buys the new pan. I thought Mr. Croftangry was looking very cadgy when he came in to play a rubber with us last night. Poor gentleman, I am sure I should be sorry to see him make a fool of himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What now, fellow," [...] said Maqueda, who was clad in {{the rough}} {{sheepskin}} of a peasant woman, which somehow looked charming upon her. [...] "Here is the cliff, there lies the plain; I see no road between the two, and <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> uncle, the prince, {{tells me that he}} never heard of one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{to come to}} {{the gist}} of my letter. I know Thursday is a half-holiday in the Rue Fossette: be ready, then, by five in the afternoon, at which hour I will send the {{carriage}} to take you out to La Terrasse. Be sure to come: you may meet some old acquaintance. Good-by, <b>my</b> <b>wise,</b> dear, grave little god-daughter.--Very truly yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|Emp. Death! must I beg {{the pity}} of my slave? Must a king beg?--Yes; love's a greater king; A tyrant, nay, a devil, that {{possesses}} me: He tunes the organs of my voice, and speaks, Unknown to me, within me; pushes me, And drives me on by force.-- Say I should wed her, would not <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> subjects Take check, {{and think it}} strange? perhaps revolt? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, most wise uncle. And {{therefore}} <b>my</b> still <b>wiser</b> {{parents are}} going to treat me like a man indeed, and send me out into the world to seek my fortunes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{left the}} room. Miss Jillgall appealed to me. I imitated <b>my</b> father's <b>wise</b> brevity of expression: [...] "Sorry to {{disappoint}} you, Selina; I know no {{more about it}} than you do. Come upstairs." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary, since first I knew thee, to this hour, My love hath deepened, with <b>my</b> <b>wiser</b> sense Of what in Woman is to reverence; Thy clear heart, {{fresh as}} e'er was forest-flower, Still opens {{more to me}} its {{beauteous}} dower;-- But let praise hush,--Love asks no evidence To prove itself well-placed: we know not whence It gleans the straws that thatch its humble bower: We can but say we {{found it in the}} heart, Spring of all sweetest thoughts, arch foe of blame, Sower of flowers in the dusty mart, Pure vestal of the poet's holy flame,-- This is enough, and we have done our part If we but keep it spotless as it came.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{were both}} very wet. I {{was a young}} fool in those days, and I was playing the giddy goat--I was just going up to Oxford, and <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> father had sent me to America {{on a visit to}} enlarge my mind--I fell over-board, and was {{proceeding}} to drown, when Alec jumped in after me and held me up by the hair of my head.' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, I'll not urge it,--Thou hast other work-- But for thy petulant {{words do}} thou this penance: I do forbid thee here, to give {{henceforth}} Food, coin, or clothes, to any living soul. Thy thriftless waste doth scandalise the elect, And maim thine usefulness: thou dost elude <b>My</b> <b>wise</b> restrictions still: 'Tis great, to live Poor, among riches; when thy wealth is spent, Want is not merit, but necessity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen, my good fellows,' {{cried the}} king, {{as soon as}} he saw them. 'Hear what <b>my</b> <b>wise</b> {{counsellors}} have thought of. As you, Simon the second, can see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to climb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many seas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter of the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.' ...|$|E
60|$|So then, {{weighing}} {{all things}} well, and myself severely, I resolved to follow <b>my</b> Mentor's <b>wise</b> counsel; neither arrogating aught, nor abating of just dues; but circulating freely, sociably, and frankly, among the gods, heroes, high priests, kings, and gentlemen, {{that made up}} the principalities of Mardi.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, <b>my</b> best--my <b>wisest</b> Rebecca!--Let us hence--let us hence!--Money he will lack, for he {{has just}} {{returned}} from Palestine, and, as they say, from prison--and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise out of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us hence!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mary, since first I knew thee, to this hour, [...] My love hath deepened, with <b>my</b> <b>wiser</b> sense [...] Of what in Woman is to reverence; [...] Thy clear heart, {{fresh as}} e'er was forest-flower, [...] Still opens {{more to me}} its {{beauteous}} dower;-- [...] But let praise hush,--Love asks no evidence [...] To prove itself well-placed; we know not whence [...] It gleans the straws that thatch its humble bower: [...] We can but say we {{found it in the}} heart, [...] Spring of all sweetest thoughts, arch foe of blame, [...] Sower of flowers in the dusty mart, [...] Pure vestal of the poet's holy flame,-- [...] This is enough, and we have done our part [...] If we but keep it spotless as it came.|$|R
