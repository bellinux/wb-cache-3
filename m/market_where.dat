5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the <b>market,</b> <b>where</b> fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the <b>market,</b> <b>where</b> nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E

5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara <b>Market,</b> <b>where</b> they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E

5|$|In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was {{separated}} and {{established as a}} wholly owned regional subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines on August 8. On November 1, the airline inaugurated its first flight from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the local government subsidy was terminated {{at the end of}} the 2000 fiscal year and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic marketing strategy, JAL found a niche <b>market</b> <b>where</b> the 100-plus-seats Boeing 737s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats Bombardier CRJ-200s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.|$|E
5|$|The VE Commodore {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian <b>market,</b> <b>where</b> it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly double that of its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota Corolla in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 has helped to re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total Commodore sales. In 2007 the VE Commodore became the fifth Commodore model to receive the Wheels Car of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now {{competing}} directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communication package, (which was also {{used as the basis}} for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a <b>market</b> <b>where</b> Delrina's Cyberjack browser could not hope to compete.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock <b>market</b> <b>where</b> commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Since its launch, monthly sales {{numbers of}} the console have {{generally}} been higher than its competitors around the globe. According to the NPD Group, the Wii sold more units in the United States than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined {{in the first half}} of 2007. This lead is even larger in the Japanese <b>market,</b> <b>where</b> it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console’s release. It also broke the 360’s Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Creangă's death, efforts began {{to collect his}} {{manuscript}} writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project {{came to an abrupt}} halt due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași <b>market,</b> <b>where</b> they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale ("Electorals"). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams.|$|E
30|$|The novel {{result in}} {{relation}} to Berton and Garibaldi (2012) is that, while T_upp increases with F, T_low decreases. Thus, for given T, {{it is more likely}} that firms will only provide training to workers under permanent contracts in dual labor <b>markets</b> (<b>where</b> F is large), than in more unified labor <b>markets</b> (<b>where</b> F is smaller). This yields the main theoretical prediction to be tested in the empirical section.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{implementation}} of constrained-efficient allocations in labour <b>markets</b> <b>where</b> a basic coordination problem leads to an equilibrium matching friction. We argue that these allocations can be achieved in a non-cooperative equilibrium if wages are determined by ex post bidding. This holds true even in finite-sized <b>markets</b> <b>where</b> the equilibrium-matching process has decreasing returns to scale - where the `Hosios rule' does not apply - both with and without heterogeneity. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} <b>markets</b> <b>where</b> two {{technologies}} co-exist and compete and predicting consumer choice {{in this situation}} is difficult. Existing theories such as the diffusion of innovation go some way to explaining the initial take up of the new technology but in <b>markets</b> <b>where</b> both technologies are in a mature stage, other measures such as consumer involvement may be better indicators of consumer choice. This study examines the relationship between domain specific innovativeness (DSI) and consumer involvement profiles (CIP) in the camera market. It provides evidence of cross cultural validity of these scales and provides initial evidence to suggest consumer involvement is a better predictor of behaviour than innovativeness in <b>markets</b> <b>where</b> two relatively mature technologies compete side by side...|$|R
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a <b>market</b> <b>where</b> ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive <b>market</b> <b>where</b> fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
