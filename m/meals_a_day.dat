An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and free entertainment with a week's full board, at a cost of between 35shillings (£1.75) and £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year.

Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds of lives.|$|E

5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. The North Korea Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to completely halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. At best there were rations for only one or two <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness.|$|E

The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E

30|$|Van der Gaag and Tan (undated) {{have also}} argued that {{benefits}} of ECD programs are not only related to education {{and that there are}} also other direct benefits to the child. One of the examples they give is the provision of meals in ECD centres. The CBCCs in Malawi also provide at least <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to the children enrolled in these centres; hence children are assured of at least one <b>meal</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> In Malawi the prevalence of malnutrition has not changed much over the last 20  years: stunting among under-five children remains high at about 50 % (National Statistical Office 2011; National Statistical Office and UNICEF 2008). The provision of meals therefore ensures that children enrolled in these CBCCs have at least <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> which contributes to fighting malnutrition in a country where this is quite prevalent. The provision of these meals in the CBCCs is also a major attraction for children and Munthali et al. (2008) found that if the CBCCs run out of food children’s attendance was low and such centres eventually closed.|$|R
