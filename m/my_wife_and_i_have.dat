Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E

6000|$|... "If you {{interfere}} between us," [...] the man said, [...] "it will go hardly with you. This lady is <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a {{right to}} be here. I have the right also to throw you out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some {{time ago}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hatched out twelve little tadpoles. They were the sweetest {{children}} parents ever looked on. Their heads {{were all very}} large and round, and their tails were long and feathery, while their skins were as black and shiny as could be. We were proud of them, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> took great pains to train our children properly, that they might become respectable frogs, in time, and be a credit to us.|$|R

60|$|DEAR MRS. McQUISTON,--I {{have never}} had an {{experience}} which moved me to believe the living can communicate with the dead, but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My misery {{has brought}} me here,' replied the old man; 'I have no child, {{and all our}} lives <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> longed for one. So I left my home, and {{went out into the}} world, hoping that somewhere I might find what I was seeking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know that,' {{said the}} man; 'your real father was sold at Hamburg last Michaelmas, and your real mother died while calving in spring; but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> adopted you as our own, {{and you are}} our only heir, so you must call me [...] "Father."' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> opened the portfolio, {{and read the}} strange story of George Germaine's marriage.|$|R
60|$|MANY {{years have}} passed since <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> left the United States to pay our first visit to England.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> {{out of our}} single heart, return you {{our deepest}} and most {{grateful}} thanks, and--yesterday was her birthday.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "that I {{have that}} privilege. I see, however, that I am {{interrupting}} your game. Let me beg you to continue. With your permission, Duchess, I {{will remain a}} spectator. There are many things which <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say to one another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Easterfield, [...] "I {{will simply}} state that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{very good reason}} to believe that your niece is about to engage herself in marriage; and I will only add that we are very sorry, indeed, that this should have occurred under our roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a matter," [...] said I, [...] "which I {{can easily}} prove {{to you by}} actual demonstration. If you can wait a short time, until <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had {{something}} to eat--for I am nearly famished, and I am sure she must be--I will set your mind at rest upon that point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] he said, [...] "excuse me. This {{woman is}} <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feared {{that she was}} drowned. You have brought me back to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{through the}} land at eve we went, [...] And pluck'd the ripen'd ears. We fell out, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> [...] <b>And</b> kissed again with tears: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is inconceivable," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that any {{one should}} attempt the descent! We have rugs, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> We stay here till the clouds pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{more money to}} invest, Mr Wilkins," [...] said John Jack, sitting down after wiping his forehead, and {{producing}} a fat pocketbook; [...] "I thought of doin' it in the old way, but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been thinkin' that perhaps it might be wise {{to put some of}} the eggs in another basket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Courtledge," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you will allow me to ask you {{something}} without thinking me impertinent. You know that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken some interest in Prince Albert. It is on his account, is it not, that you look so gloomy to-night, as though you had an execution in front of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "In all my experience," [...] he said, [...] "I {{never met}} {{with a woman who}} did that! No, no; the fact is, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> parted company. There's no need to look so serious about it! Incompatibility of temper, as the saying is, has led us to a {{friendly}} separation. Equally a relief on both sides. She goes her way, I go mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were seated}} at breakfast one morning, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> when the maid {{brought in a}} telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was a British {{television}} comedy which {{aired on}} ITV in 1958. It {{was produced by}} Associated-Rediffusion Television. It starred Mai Zetterling, Rex Garner and Joan Benham.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{will think}} it over. I am {{fond of the}} sea, but shall {{certainly}} be fonder of <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel that your wishes in the matter should weigh with me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The man {{shook his}} head. [...] "There is no place," [...] he said sadly, [...] "to which I can in reason ask a ship to carry {{me and my}} family. We have no money, no {{property}} whatever. In any other place I would be far poorer than I am here. My children are not uneducated; <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done our best for them in that respect, {{and we have some}} books with us. So, as you see, it would be rash in me to leave a home which, rude as it is, shelters and supports my family, to go as paupers and strangers to some other land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{facts are}} these, Mr. Holmes," [...] said he. [...] "I am a married man, {{and have been}} so for three years. During that time <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> loved each other as fondly and lived as happily as any two that ever were joined. We {{have not had a}} difference, not one, in thought or word or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has {{suddenly}} sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is something in her life and in her thought of which I know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. We are estranged, and I want to know why.|$|E
6000|$|The same evening Lord de Burg said to Wulf, who had tarried in London, while Beorn had at once {{set out for}} Fareham: [...] "I {{think the}} time has come, Wulf, when I can speak of a subject {{that has been in}} my {{thoughts}} for a long time, and which, although you have not spoken, has, as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> both seen, been dear to you. Normandy and England are now one, and we are vassals of the same king. As long as there was a probability that Englishmen and Normans might again be ranged in battle against each other, it was not expedient that aught should be done in the matter, but, now this obstacle is removed, I can offer you the alliance on which I am sure your heart is set, and give you the hand of my daughter in marriage." ...|$|E
60|$|Left in the dark, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sought each other's arms again, {{and stood}} {{together}} {{for a few moments}} heart to heart, tightly clasping each other, and kissed each other fervently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{will get}} to my {{business}} without delay. I thought it might interest {{you to know that}} I propose to bring a counter-petition against <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall make you co-respondent.' ...|$|R
60|$|I did not wonder, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{agreed to}} go with him that very evening to old Mr. Scott's house. The old gentleman {{received}} us very cordially in his little parlor.|$|R
6000|$|To-day <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been at {{the picture}} and {{sculpture}} galleries of the Capitol. I rather enjoyed looking at several of the pictures, though at this moment I particularly remember only a very beautiful face of a man, one of two heads on the same canvas by Vandyke. Yes; I did look with new admiration at Paul Veronese's [...] "Rape of Europa." [...] It must have been, in its day, the most brilliant and rejoicing picture, the most voluptuous, the most exuberant, that ever put the sunshine to shame. The bull has all Jupiter in him, so tender and gentle, yet so passionate, that you feel it indecorous to look at him; and Europa, under her thick rich stuffs and embroideries, is all a woman. What a pity that such a picture should fade, and perplex the beholder with such splendor shining through such forlornness! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is my gamekeeper," [...] {{said the}} laird; [...] "and {{there is not}} a better or more {{trustworthy}} man in the island, when he is sober; but when he takes one of his drinking fits, he seems to lose all control over himself, and goes from bad to worse, till a fit of delirium tremens almost kills him. He usually goes for a good while after that without touching a drop, and at such times he is a most respectful, painstaking man, willing to take any amount of trouble to serve one, but when he breaks down he is as bad as ever--nay, even worse. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done what we could for him, and have {{tried to get him to}} take the temperance pledge, but hitherto without avail. My wife has even gone the length of becoming a total abstainer, in order to have more influence over him; but I don't quite see my way to do that myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|But all our {{resources}} have not of late been Pacific. We have had enlightened society: La Farge the painter, and your friend Henry Adams: a great privilege - would it might endure. I would go oftener to see them, {{but the place}} is awkward to reach on horseback. I had to swim my horse the last time I went to dinner; and as I have not yet returned the clothes I had to borrow, I dare not return in the same plight: it seems inevitable - {{as soon as the}} wash comes in, I plump straight into the American consul's shirt or trousers! They, I believe, would come oftener to see me but for the horrid doubt that weighs upon our commissariat department; we have OFTEN almost nothing to eat; a guest would simply break the bank; <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> dined on one avocado pear; I have several times dined on hard bread and onions. What would you do with a guest at such narrow seasons? - eat him? or serve up a labour boy fricasseed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Croyden," [...] I answered, [...] "Edith--it means this. I {{have never}} {{found the courage}} to tell you. I am a married man. The woman seated there is <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> love you." ...|$|R
60|$|We both {{thank you}} greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you sent. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> join in affectionate remembrances and {{greetings}} to {{yourself and your}} aunt, and in the sincere tender of our sympathies.|$|R
