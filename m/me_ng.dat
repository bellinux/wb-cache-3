In this article, we define Mg(P) = {m ∈Mg: Am ⊆ PMg for some ideal A of Re {{satisfying}} A 6 ⊆ P} that is an Re-submodule of Mg, and we investigate some results on this submodule. Also, we introduce a situation where if N is a gr-prime R-submodule of M, then (Ng: Mg) is a maximal ideal of Re. We close this article by introducing a situation where if N is a gr- R-submodule of M such that Ne is a weakly prime Re-submodule of <b>Me,</b> then <b>Ng</b> is a prime Re-submodule of Mg...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{the extent}} of {{protonation}} of functional groups lying {{on either side of}} water–hydrophobe interfaces are deemed essential to enzymatic catalysis, molecular recognition, bioenergetic transduction, and atmospheric aerosol–gas exchanges. The sign and range of such differences, however, remain conjectural. Herein we report experiments showing that gaseous carboxylic acids RCOOH(g) begin to deprotonate on the surface of water significantly more acidic than that supporting the dissociation of dissolved acids RCOOH(aq). Thermodynamic analysis indicates that > 6 H_(2) O molecules must participate in the deprotonation of RCOOH(g) on water, but quantum mechanical calculations on a model air–water interface predict that such event is hindered by a significant kinetic barrier unless OH− ions are present therein. Thus, by detecting RCOO− we demonstrate the presence of OH− on the aerial side of on pH > 2 water exposed to RCOOH(g). Furthermore, because in similar experiments the base (<b>Me)</b> _(3) <b>N(g)</b> is protonated only on pH 1 nm) deeper shear planes probed in electrophoresis, thereby implying the existence of OH− gradients in the interfacial region. This fact could account for the weak OH− signals detected by surface-specific spectroscopies...|$|R

Choosing and applying the best philosophies and techniques is very difficult as most MEs deploy complex and unique configurations of processes and resource systems to cope with changing product flows. It follows that systematic methods of achieving model-driven reconfiguration and interoperation of component-based manufacturing systems are required to design, engineer and change next generation (<b>NG)</b> <b>MEs.</b> This paper describes a novel systematic approach, namely an integrated modelling approach (IMA), designed to support next generation reconfigurable manufacturing systems (NGRMS). The IMA is helpful in creating coherent sets of models that facilitate the engineering of production planning and control (PPC) strategies. Coherent multi-perspective industrial case study models are also presented that have facilitated process reengineering and associated resource system configuration. Those models have a capability to enable PPC decision making in support of complex organisation design and change (OD&C) ...|$|R
40|$|The edifice of Stromboli volcano gravitationally {{collapsed}} several {{immediately after}} the lateral collapse, which wrapped around col l aps ed s ever al t i <b>mes</b> dur i <b>ng</b> i t s vol cani c hi s t or y (> 100 ka–present). The largest Holocene event occurred during {{the final stage of}} the Neostromboli activity (∼ 13 – 5 ka), and was accompanied by the emplacement of phreatomagmatic and lahar deposits, known as the Secche di Lazzaro succession. A stratigraphic and paleomagnetic study of the Secche di Lazzaro deposits allows the interpretation of the emplacement and the eruptive process- es. We identify three main units within the succession that correspond to changing eruption conditions. The lower unit (UA) consists of accretionary lapilli-rich, thinly bedded, parallel- to cross-stratified ash deposits, interpreted to indicate {{the early stages of the}} eruption and emplacement of dilute pyroclastic density currents. Upward, the second unit (UB) of the deposit is more massive and the beds thicker, indicating an increase in the sedimentation rate from pyroclastic density currents. The upper unit (UC) caps the succession with thick, immediately post-eruptive lahars, which reworked ash deposited on the volcano’s slope. Flow directions obtained by Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibil- ity (AMS) analysis of the basal bed of UA at the type locality suggest a provenance of pyroclastic currents from the sea. This is interpreted to be related to the initial base- surges associated with water–magma interaction that occurred the shoulder of the sector collapse scar. Upward in the stratigraphy (upper beds of UA and UB) paleoflow directions change and show a provenance from the summit vent, pro- bably related to the multiple collapses of a vertical, pulsatory eruptive column...|$|R
