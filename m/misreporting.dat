The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by <b>misreporting</b> his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E

25|$|Two {{contemporary}} {{estimates were}} {{given for the}} number of occupants in each lifeboat, one by the British inquiry that followed the disaster, and one by survivor Archibald Gracie, who obtained accounts and data from other survivors. However, the figures given– 854 persons and 795 persons respectively– far exceed the confirmed number of 712 survivors, due to confusion and <b>misreporting.</b> Some occupants were transferred between boats before being picked up by RMS Carpathia. More recent research has helped to produce {{estimates of the number of}} occupants that are closer to the total number of survivors rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
25|$|First Great Western {{admitted}} to <b>misreporting</b> {{the number of}} cancellations in the period from August to December 2007, revised figures showing the company to have breached the cancellation threshold in the franchise contract. Specifically the company was alleged to have deliberately cancelled trains on the day prior to service without the prior approval of the Department for Transport, and without recording these cancellations on their performance figures. The company was also accused of falsifying records in order to claim dispensation for large numbers of cancellations. First Great Western was named in a Passenger Focus survey as the worst train operating company for 2007.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{compliance}} with fisheries regulations regarding species caught {{and amount of}} the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity {{by the time the}} whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and <b>misreporting</b> it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port.|$|E

500|$|The British {{were able}} to obtain {{provisions}} after the skirmish but they were slightly more expensive. English sinologist Arthur Waley theorised that given {{the corruption of the}} Canton Navy, Chinese patrol boats tried to obtain bribes from the peasants by offering to turn a blind eye on their trading activities during the embargo. Since the bribes were larger than they were willing to pay, the embargo was enforced and the British were cut from the supplies. But after the battle, the Chinese were disinclined to risk another naval confrontation and accepted a smaller bribe from the peasants, resulting in food supplies being available again but at a slightly higher price. The Chinese commander Lai sent a disingenuous report of victory, claiming to have sunk a two-masted English ship and inflicted at least 40 or 50 casualties. This is the first of what Chinese accounts later called the [...] "Six Smashing Blows" [...] against the British navy. However, these accounts were fabricated and the official <b>misreporting</b> of events were repeated throughout the war.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{a series}} of {{research}} papers and reports published in the mid-2010s, Britain’s financial firms provide sophisticated methods to launder billions of pounds annually, including money from the proceeds of corruption around the world as well as the world’s drug trade, thus making the City a global hub for illicit finance. According to a Deutsche Bank study published in March 2015, Britain was attracting circa one billion pounds of capital inflows a month not recorded by official statistics, up to 40 percent probably originating from Russia, which implies <b>misreporting</b> by financial institutions, sophisticated tax avoidance, and the UK's [...] "safe-haven" [...] reputation.|$|E

40|$|People with {{familial}} {{history of}} disease often consult with genetic counselors about their chance of carrying mutations that increase disease risk. To aid them, genetic counselors use Mendelian models that predict whether the person carries deleterious mutations {{based on their}} reported family history. Such models rely on accurate reporting of each member 2 ̆ 7 s diagnosis and age of diagnosis, but this information may be inaccurate. Commonly encountered errors in family history can significantly distort predictions, and thus can alter the clinical management of people undergoing counseling, screening, or genetic testing. We derive general results about the distortion in the carrier probability estimate caused by <b>misreported</b> diagnoses in relatives. We show that the Bayes Factor that channels all family history information has a convenient and intuitive interpretation. We focus on {{the ratio of the}} carrier odds given correct diagnosis vs. given <b>misreported</b> diagnosis to measure the impact of errors. We derive the general form of this ratio and approximate it in realistic cases. <b>Misreported</b> age of diagnosis usually causes less distortion than <b>misreported</b> diagnosis. This is the first systematic quantitative assessment of the effect of <b>misreported</b> family history on mutation prediction. We apply the results to the BRCAPRO model, which predicts the risk of carrying a mutation in the breast and ovarian cancer genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2...|$|R

2500|$|Because some {{governments have}} {{strongly}} promoted atheism {{and others have}} strongly condemned it, atheism may be either over-reported or under-reported for different countries.
