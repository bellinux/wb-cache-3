5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on <b>manual</b> <b>labor</b> and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. <b>Manual</b> <b>labor</b> was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E

5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy <b>manual</b> <b>labor,</b> several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the <b>manual</b> <b>labor</b> of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E
50|$|Peasant women, {{who lived}} and worked on manors, {{comprised}} {{the largest group of}} working women in the Middle Ages. Most peasant women wed at some point, and their <b>manual</b> <b>labors</b> were shared with their husbands. Manorial records indicate that many unmarried women held land on the manor, just as men, and were required to perform the same amount of labor to retain their tenancy. Without the option to divide their labors, singlewomen became one of the hardest working groups within the peasant community.|$|R

5|$|During Mao's rule (1949–1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their <b>manual</b> <b>labor</b> for farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for their hard work, they were provided {{access to education}} and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real decision-making power.|$|E

On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R.

5|$|Stone {{hoped to}} earn {{most of her}} college {{expenses}} through teaching {{in one of the}} institute’s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school’s <b>manual</b> <b>labor</b> program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily <b>manual</b> <b>labor,</b> which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} low socioeconomic status (SES), indicated by low level of education, occupation and income, on 3 months functional outcome after ischemic stroke. We analyzed data from the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR), a multicenter and prospective registry of consecutive patients with acute cerebrovascular events occurred between September 2007 and August 2008. 11226 patients with ischemic stroke had SES and clinical characteristics data collected at baseline and mRS measured as indicator of functional outcome in 3 months follow up. Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were performed to examine associations between SES and the functional outcome. At 3 months after stroke, 5. 3 % of total patients had mRS scored at 5, 11. 3 % at score 4, 11. 1 % at score 3, 14. 4 % at score 2, 34. 2 % at score 1 and 23. 7 % at score 0. Compared to patients with educational level of ≥ 6 years and non-manual laboring, those < 6 years and <b>manual</b> <b>laboring</b> tended to have higher mRS score (P< 0. 001). Multinomial adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of outcome in manual workers were significantly increased (ORs from 1. 38 to 1. 87), but OR in patients with less income was not significant. There were similar patterns of association The impact may be stronger in patients aged < 65 years (P = 0. 003, P< 0. 001 respectively) and being male (P = 0. 001, P< 0. 001 respectively). Our study provides evidence {{that people who are}} relatively more deprived in socioeconomic status suffer poorer outcome after ischemic stroke. The influence of low educational level and <b>manual</b> <b>laboring</b> can be more intensive than low income level on 3 -month outcome. Health policy and service should target the deprived populations to reduce the public health burden in the society...|$|R
40|$|Background Previous {{findings}} of the association between socioeconomic deprivation (SED) and mortality after ischemic stroke are inconsistent. There {{is a lack of}} data on the association with combined low education, occupational class and income. We assessed the associations of three indicators with mortality. Methods We examined data from the China National Stroke Registry, recording all stroke patients occurred between September 2007 and August 2008. Baseline SED was measured using low levels of education at < 6 years, occupation as <b>manual</b> <b>laboring</b> and average family income per capita at ≤¥ 1, 000 per month. 12, 246 patients with ischemic stroke were analyzed.

40|$|Disk {{prefetching}} {{has been}} widely accepted {{as a way of}} minimizing process blocking time due to I/Os. However, most of current techniques highly depend on <b>manual</b> <b>labors</b> or source program analyses, thereby making prefetching less attractive and less applicable. Hence, in this paper, we propose disk prefetching based on rule based mining approach. In this scheme, we assume that I/Os happen during program startups are easily predictable because there are lots of configuration files read by programs in the initial loading stage. Therefore, we made such predictable I/Os to be analyzed and automatically prefetched by the kernel. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments using a synthesized application and server programs like Apache and Tomcat. According to the experimental results, it was shown that the proposed approach reduced program startup time up to 70 % with synthesized application, and up to 7 % with real application. ...|$|R
5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. Not many early horror films followed White Zombies Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology. These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing <b>manual</b> <b>labor.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was {{a direct result of the}} rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed <b>manual</b> <b>labor,</b> helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled <b>manual</b> <b>labor,</b> assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} developing a {{computer aided design system}} for a traditional tie-dyeing craft named “Shibori”. These products of folk crafts are made with the <b>manual</b> <b>labors</b> and their processes are divided into a lot of practiced hand works. In addition their manufacturing processes are dispersed to different regions. So the practiced hand works of the “Drawing / Pattern carving Shibori” process decrease in number. Producing Shibori products may become difficult because anyone cannot plan the Shibori products in the future. If the “Drawing / Pattern carving Shibori” process is simplified by computerizing, we can record the Shibori technology and can also design Shibori products easily. In this report, therefore, we developed both a CAD system for “Drawing” process in order to simplify its process and keep skilled hands of Shibori products, and a CAM system for “Pattern carving Shibori” process using CAD data. This CAD system is useful for “Mokume-Shibori” to make their stitch images by means of its small scale modification.

40|$|The {{importance}} of skills has been increased recently as <b>manual</b> <b>labors</b> are still widely on demand. We have investigated proper ties commonly observable among variety of skills. However, {{it is not}} easy to study the embodied knowledge, i. e. the items of knowledge enabling skills, given the complexity of tacit knowing, especially when its contexts are not specified. Therefore, we focused on a rhythm action game to investigate open skill, a class of skills whose contexts are unknown, with a hope that our study might cast a new light on tacit knowing under unspecific contexts. We analyzedthe skill required toper form the rhythm action game using an Eye Tracker. We found through our experiment that the experts fix their eyes on a particular point while they play the game. Similar phenomena are observed in other activities,where the skills are thought to be open one. The experts are found to control their visions by limiting the time to watch items so that they can perform the task most effectively, which suggests they may automate the perception-action cycle. 人工知能学会第 24 回全国大会=The 24 th Annual Conference of the Japansese Society Artificial Intelligence, 2010. 開催: 2010 年 6 月 9 日～ 6 月 11 日 3 G 1 -OS 2 a オーガナイズドセッション「OS- 2 a 身体知の表現と獲得 1...|$|R
