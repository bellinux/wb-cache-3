25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernization}} of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system</b> – which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room – rather than a fixed block system. This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems.|$|E
25|$|The Jubilee {{line has}} been {{converted}} to automatic train operation, using the SelTrac S40 <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system.</b> The new system enables London Underground to run more frequent trains, increase capacity by a further 33%, and cut journey times by around 22%. Equipment installation and testing for the new systems began in late 2006, and the line upgrade work required the closure of sections of the Jubilee line each weekend during 2009. Although the project was due for completion in March 2010, the closures continued through 2010, and the upgrade was not finished until spring 2011. The new signalling system finally came into full operation on 26 June 2011. As a result, services began operating at the new higher frequency of 27 trains per hour from late July 2011, and were later improved to currently allow 30 trains per hour.|$|E

Applying multisensor fusion algorithms in the vehicle navigation field has made it possible to make inexpensive and accurate positioning systems which will satisfy the railways <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> control <b>system</b> requirements.

With a moving block setup, lineside signals are unnecessary, and instructions are passed directly to the trains. This has the advantage of increasing track capacity by allowing trains to run closer together while maintaining the required safety margins.|$|E

As well as reducing journey times a 33% increase in capacity will be created on all four lines making the best use out of 192 S-Stock trains which too have a universal design exclusively for the Sub-surface lines.|$|E
40|$|Previous work {{carried out}} by the author (and many others) has {{involved}} the application of formal descriptions techniques to verifying the correctness of fixed <b>block</b> railway signalling <b>systems.</b> These systems are referred to as such because the railway is divided into sections of track, which are separated by signals.

50|$|Rail systems {{vary greatly}} in {{performance}} and route capacity, with metro systems having the highest capacity. Tram and light rail systems have in theory very high route capacities, {{but in practice}} route capacities of 12 trains per hour is a practical upper limit. For High Speed Rail a route capacity of up to 18 trains per hour may be possible. The Punggol metro line in Singapore uses a <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system</b> to achieve a headway of 90 seconds, so the route capacity is 40 trains per hour. Route capacity for a commuter rail system is typically around 12 to 16 trains per hour, which is lower than a metro, as the trains are longer, and the traffic is often mixed with other rail services such as freight and intercity trains. By contrast the Alameda Freight Corridor in Los Angeles has a route capacity of 150 freight trains per day, which is high in comparison to other rail freight systems, but low compared to metros.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{simulate}} operating characteristics of trains better in different block conditions, {{three kinds of}} models are proposed on the train motion under different signaling systems based on cellular automaton(CA) model in this paper, i. e., the train motion behavior under the fixed block, the moving-like block and the moving block conditions. Using the proposed engineering models, we analyze trajectories and space-time diagrams of railway traffic flow, calculate and compare the minimum departure interval under different conditions, and discuss {{the effect of the}} proportion and the departure sequence of different trains on mixed traffic flow. The simulation results show that the minimum headway time and the run time of <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system</b> are shortest, and with the low proportion of slow trains and suitable departure sequence the average run time of trains will be shorten greatly.

40|$|As {{one of the}} key {{components}} for the railway transportation system, the Train Operation Diagram can be greatly influenced by many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Therefore, the railway train flow has shown the strong nonlinear characteristics, which makes it quite difficult to take further relative studies.

Considering the mixed features of multispeed running trains on the passenger dedicated lines, this paper presents a new train model under the <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system</b> with different types of trains running with the cellular automaton idea. By analyzing such key factors as the maintenance skylight, the proportion of the multispeed running trains, and the distance between adjacent stations and departure intervals, the corresponding running rules for the cellular automaton model are reestablished herewith. By means of this CA model, the program of train running system is designed to analyze the potential impact on railway carrying capacity by various factors; the model can also be implemented to simulate the actual train running process and to draw the train operation diagram by computers.

An examination is made {{of the performance of}} four and five aspect fixed block signalling, theoretical pure moving block signalling, and a more practical quantised <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> <b>system,</b> when operating under both steady state and perturbed running conditions. For each signalling system, a number of basic geographical components, which are commonly found in a railway network, are analysed in order to determine their maximum capacity {{for a wide range of}} steady state operating conditions. An example is included of an algorithm which may be used to combine a number of these basic components to facilitate analysis of a more complex configuration. In the investigation of perturbed operating conditions, a specific delay is imposed on a train, and, with a range of running headways, the resulting delays to subsequent trains are evaluated for each signalling system. Thus, it is possible to decide if a signalling system is stable under a given set of operating conditions. Also, if the system is stable, the total number of trains which experience some delay may be determined. Finally, an examination is made of a line which simultaneously carries high speed trains, operating under moving block, and low speed trains, operating under fixed block signalling...|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasOne of {{the main}} {{priorities}} for metro line operators is the reduction of energy consumption, due to the environmental impact and economic cost. The new <b>moving</b> <b>block</b> signalling <b>system</b> CBTC (Communication Based Train Control) is being installed {{in order to increase}} the transport capacity of new metro lines, and to upgrade lines equipped with the former fixed <b>block</b> signalling <b>systems.</b> In addition, this new technology could be used to improve energy efficiency in the traffic operation, due to its capability to update the ATO (Automatic Train Operation) driving commands not only at stations but also along the journey. In this paper a new optimization algorithm is proposed to design ATO CBTC speed profiles to minimize energy consumption, generating the Pareto optimal curve. The algorithm is a multi-objective NSGA-II-F based on simulation of the train motion under uncertainty. The main source of uncertainty in the consumption calculation is the mass of the train, which is dependent on the passenger load, and it is modeled as a fuzzy number. In addition, a new method is proposed to fill running time gaps with dominated points, providing a pseudo-Pareto curve. The NSGA-II-F algorithm has been applied to design ATO CBTC optimal speed profiles in a case study of Metro de Madrid, providing additional energy savings up to 7. 3 % compared to former fixed <b>block</b> signalling <b>systems</b> and a well time-distributed pseudo-Pareto curve for the running times required by the traffic regulation system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
