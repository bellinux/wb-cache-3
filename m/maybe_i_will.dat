[...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if I start to play again on hard courts, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} known for some time that retroviruses can {{disseminate}} between immune cells either by conventional cell-free transmission or by directed cell-to-cell spread. Over the past few years there has been increasing interest in how retroviruses may use cell-to-cell spread to promote more rapid infection kinetics and circumvent humoral immunity. Effective humoral immune responses are intimately linked with innate immunity and the interplay between retroviruses and innate immunity is a rapidly expanding area of research that has been advanced considerably by the identification of cellular restriction factors that provide barriers to retroviral infection. The effect of innate immunity and restriction factors on retroviral cell-to-cell spread has been comparatively little studied; however recent work suggests this <b>maybe</b> changing. Here <b>I</b> <b>will</b> review some recent advances in what is a budding area of retroviral research...|$|R

5000|$|Counterfactuals {{refer to}} things that are {{contrary}} to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in [...] "if"-clauses by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically {{referred to in the}} if-clause. For example, If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask contains the counterfactual If I knew, which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition [...] "I know that". This contrasts with the construction If I know that,..., which is not a counterfactual because it means that maybe I know it and maybe I don't (or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> know it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not). Likewise, If I had known that, I would have gone there contains the counterfactual If I had known, denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the pluperfect verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because {{most of the time the}} distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like [...] "prior knowledge of X usually implies present knowledge of X". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.|$|E
