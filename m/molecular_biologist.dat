40|$|Abstract Background This study {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} ethical reasoning and ethical issues {{at stake in the}} daily work of physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> in Denmark. The aim {{of this study was to}} test empirically whether there is a difference in ethical considerations and principles between Danish physicians and Danish <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists,</b> and whether the bioethical principles of the American bioethicists Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress are applicable to these groups. Method This study is based on 12 semi-structured interviews with three groups of respondents: a group of oncology physicians working in a clinic at a public hospital and two groups of <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> conducting basic research, one group employed at a public university and the other in a private biopharmaceutical company. Results In this sample, the authors found that oncology physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> employed in a private biopharmaceutical company have the specific principle of beneficence in mind in their daily work. Both groups are motivated to help sick patients. According to the study, <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> explicitly consider nonmaleficence in relation to the environment, the researchers' own health, and animal models; and only implicitly in relation to patients or human subjects. In contrast, considerations of nonmaleficence by oncology physicians relate to patients or human subjects. Physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> both consider the principle of respect for autonomy as a negative obligation in the sense that informed consent of patients should be respected. However, in contrast to <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists,</b> physicians experience the principle of respect for autonomy as a positive obligation as the physician, in dialogue with the patient, offers a medical prognosis based upon the patients wishes and ideas, mutual understanding, and respect. Finally, this study discloses utilitarian characteristics in the overall conception of justice as conceived by oncology physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> from the private biopharmaceutical company. <b>Molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> employed at a public university are, in this study, concerned with allocation, however, they do not propose a specific theory of justice. Conclusion This study demonstrates that each of the four bioethical principles of the American bioethicists Tom L. Beauchamp & James F. Childress – respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice – are reflected in the daily work of physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> in Denmark. Consequently, these principles are applicable in the Danish biomedical setting. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{presents}} {{results from a}} qualitative empirical investigation of how Danish oncology physicians and Danish <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> experience the principle of respect for autonomy in their daily work. Methods This study is based on 12 semi-structured interviews with three groups of respondents: a group of oncology physicians working in a clinic at a public hospital and two groups of <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> conducting basic research, one group employed at a public university {{and the other in}} a private biopharmaceutical company. Results We found that that <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> consider the principle of respect for autonomy as a negative obligation, where the informed consent of patients or research subjects should be respected. Furthermore, <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> believe that very sick patients are constraint by the circumstances to a certain choice. However, in contrast to <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists,</b> oncology physicians experience the principle of respect for autonomy as a positive obligation, where the physician in dialogue with the patient performs a medical prognosis based on the patient's wishes and ideas, mutual understanding and respect. Oncology physicians believe that they have a positive obligation to adjust {{to the level of the}} patient when providing information making sure that the patient understands. Oncology physicians experience situations where the principle of respect for autonomy does not apply because the patient is in a difficult situation. Conclusion In this study we explore the moral views and attitudes of oncology physicians and <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists</b> and compare these views with bioethical theories of the American bioethicists Tom L. Beauchamp & James F. Childress and the Danish philosophers Jakob Rendtorff & Peter Kemp. This study shows that essential parts of the two bioethical theories are reflected in the daily work of Danish oncology physicians and Danish <b>molecular</b> <b>biologists.</b> However, the study also explores dimensions where the theories can be developed further to be concordant with biomedical practice. The hope is that this study enhances the understanding of the principle of respect for autonomy and the way it is practiced. </p...|$|R

25|$|In October 2006, a legal {{challenge}} was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog Public Patent Foundation. They contended {{that two of}} the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the <b>molecular</b> <b>biologist</b> Jeanne Loring who stated that University of Wisconsin–Madison stem cell pioneer James Thomson's techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks. The outcome of this {{legal challenge}} was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.

25|$|This {{view point}} is {{rejected}} {{or at least}} controversially discussed by {{those who want to}} preserve the “pure” dingo. Here for instance the <b>molecular</b> <b>biologist</b> Alan Wilton from the University of New South Wales argues that a maximizing of the “genetic purity” is an essential aspect of the dingo conservation. Dingo-hybrids would supposedly increase the predation on native species, because they would have more litters per year and therefore would have to raise more pups and some of them would be bigger than the average dingo. He also argued that it is, for instance, not sufficient to regard a wild dog with a little non-dingo-content as a “pure” dingo if it more or less acts the same way. Wilton was of the opinion that the scale had to be set higher when “pure” dingoes are available. Corbett and Daniels agreed that it is practical and desirable to minimize the effect of other domestic dog genes. By this it would first be possible to find areas were the process is slower {{and to be able to}} limit it later; and second the populations would be able to develop accordingly to their natural environment. Furthermore, hybrids and other feral domestic dogs would probably not have the same tourist effect, because they don’t correspond with the current expectations on wild dingoes.|$|E
25|$|Three alumni, {{biochemist}} Stanford Moore (B.A. 1935), {{economist and}} microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus (Ph.D. 1971), and former Vice President Al Gore {{have won the}} Nobel Prize.

Alain Connes and Vaughan Jones, both Fields Medalists, are Distinguished Professors of Mathematics at the university. In addition, the university has a rich literary and journalistic legacy. Most notably, the Southern Agrarians were a group of influential American writers and poets in the 1920s and 1930s based at Vanderbilt. Three U.S. Poets Laureate are Vanderbilt alums: Allen Tate (B.A. 1922), Robert Penn Warren (B.A. 1925), and Randall Jarrell (M.A. 1938). Warren later {{went on to win the}} Pulitzer Prize for fiction and for poetry. Novelists James Dickey (B.A. 1949) and James Patterson (M.A. 1970) also graduated from Vanderbilt. Two well-known sportswriters, Grantland Rice (B.A. 1901) and Fred Russell (B.A. 1927), have a scholarship named after them at the university, and Buster Olney (B.A. 1988) writes for ESPN.com and The New York Times. Journalist David Brinkley attended briefly. Skip Bayless (B.A. 1974), formerly of ESPN First Take, attended Vanderbilt as a recipient of the Russell-Rice scholarship. Willie Geist (B.A. 1997) is a host of MSNBC's Morning Joe. Vanderbilt alumna Hildy Kuryk is the director of communications at Vogue and former senior New York finance consultant for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
