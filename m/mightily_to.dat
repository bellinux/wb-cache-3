5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
25|$|A {{conference in}} London in March 1829 {{proposed}} an independent Greek {{state with a}} northern frontier running from Arta to Volos, and including only Euboia and the Cyclades among the islands. The Greeks were disappointed at these restricted frontiers, but were {{in no position to}} resist the will of Britain, France and Russia, who had contributed <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> Greek independence. By the Convention of May 11, 1832, Greece was finally recognized as a sovereign state.|$|E
25|$|Simmons {{speculated that}} the Oklahoma City bombing played a major part in the team's culture, noting that Thunder general manager Sam Presti has every new Thunder player visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and {{encourages}} players {{to look into the}} stands and consider that many of the team's fans were personally affected by the event. He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state of Oklahoma) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> the city's devotion.|$|E

25|$|Drew Smyly {{held the}} Red Sox to 1 hit, {{getting out of}} a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the third inning, which {{would prove to be}} {{important}} as the Rays won, 3-0, in 10 innings after neither team scored through 9. But the Sox would rebound by scoring 6 runs off of Tampa Bay ace Chris Archer, who was struggling <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> open the season. David Price pitched poorly in the rubber match; after the Red Sox jumped out to a 5-1 lead in the first inning, Price gave up 7 runs and the offense was unable {{to keep up with the}} bullpen's poor work in a Red Sox loss that had many fans questioning John Farrell's decision-making skills as a manager.|$|E
25|$|BankAmerica {{experienced}} huge {{losses in}} 1986 and 1987 by {{the placement of}} a series of bad loans in the Third World, particularly in Latin America. The company fired its CEO, Sam Armacost. Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor, A.W. (Tom) Clausen, Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost. The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations. It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co. back to Mr. Schwab. It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank. By the time of the 1987 stock market crash, BankAmerica's share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> become one of the biggest gainers of that half-decade.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{film critic}} Richard Eder, on seeing a {{retrospective}} of McCay's animation at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1975, wrote of Gertie that [...] "Disney... struggled <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> recapture" [...] the qualities in McCay's animation, but that [...] "Disney's magic, though sometimes scary, was always contained; McCay's approached necromancy". [...] Eder compared McCay's artistic vision {{to that of}} poet William Blake's, saying [...] "it was too strange and personal to be generalized or to have any children".|$|E

500|$|The film {{garnered}} more praise than I'll Do Anything and Brooks {{was again}} {{nominated for the}} Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. As Good as It Gets received a total of seven Academy Award nominations, winning two, both for Best Actor for Jack Nicholson and Best Actress for Helen Hunt. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader labelled it Brooks' best film, stating [...] "what Brooks manages to do with [...] as they struggle <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> {{connect with one another}} is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful—a triumph for everyone involved." [...] It also ranked 140 in Empire 2008 list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time". Brooks cast Jack Nicholson in both Terms of Endearment and As Good as It Gets with the actor taking an Academy Award for each role.|$|E
500|$|Stage 9 was {{the first}} major {{mountain}} stage, featuring two ascents of Mount Etna, including a summit finish. It was on this day that strong overall favorite Alberto Contador first seized control of the race. Just after 's José Rujano attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification. In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey. The Spaniard himself hinted that such a move would be in his plans. This would be likeliest to happen in the heavily undulating stage 11. The breakaway group for this stage was hard-fought and late-forming, since someone from its number could potentially become the new race leader. While 's Christophe Le Mével, who entered the day third overall and had on two other occasions come within a time bonus of claiming the jersey, made the group, neither he nor anyone in it was destined to take pink. Largely under the impetus of Michele Scarponi's [...] team, the breakaway group was caught before the finish. Contador {{and the rest of the}} overall favorites finished at the front of the race, with riders well down in the standings claiming the time bonuses, meaning Contador retained the race leadership after all.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his closing}} speech, Pope Francis told the bishops that the Church needs to [...] "chart a middle course between 'hostile rigidity' and a 'false sense of mercy'.” [...] It {{was said that}} he was [...] "striving <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> hold the [...] camps together."

2500|$|One {{observer}} {{noted that}} [...] "the playing {{on both sides}} was very loose, the batting heavy, and the errors numerous," [...] with the Chicagos playing a particularly [...] "wretched game both at the bat and in the field." [...] Chicago right fielder Tom Burns committed two particularly costly errors, allowing runs to score, with Nat Hudson giving up only three hits en route to an easy 10-3 victory. Catcher Silver Flint contributed <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> the carnage, allowing four runs to score on passed balls and making another costly throwing error to third base.|$|E
2500|$|A {{translator}} {{who contributed}} <b>mightily</b> <b>to</b> {{the advance of}} the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students. [...] After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of Muhammad Ali (1769–1849), the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became {{head of the new}} school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to Voltaire's biography of Peter the Great, along with the Marseillaise and the entire Code Napoléon. [...] This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since Abbasid times (750–1258).|$|E
60|$|That indeed was {{not very}} easy to {{discover}} at first; for Scoutbush felt so strongly the oddity of taking a pretty young woman into his counsel on a question of sanitary reform, that he felt <b>mightily</b> inclined <b>to</b> laugh, and began beating about the bush, in a sufficiently confused fashion.|$|R
