25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
500|$|On February 16, 1975, Cher {{returned}} to television with a solo show on CBS. Called Cher, {{it began as}} a highly rated special with guests Flip Wilson, Elton John, and Bette Midler. The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing, which was the largest for a weekly TV show. Early critical reception was favorable; the Los Angeles Times exclaimed that [...] "Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could be the best thing that's happened to weekly television this season." [...] Cher lasted for less than a year, replaced by a new show in which she professionally reunited with ex-husband Sonny; she said, [...] "doing a show alone was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle." ...|$|E
500|$|Hand {{took the}} defeat in his stride. He {{considered}} the election {{merely as a}} first step in a reform campaign for [...] "real national democracy". Though he had limited his public involvement in the election campaign, he now took part in planning a party structure. He also accepted the Progressive nomination for chief judge of New York Court of Appeals, then an elective position, in September 1913. He refused to campaign, however, and later admitted that [...] "the thought of harassing the electorate was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear". His vow of silence affected his showing, and he received only 13% of the votes. Hand came to regret his candidacy: [...] "I ought to have lain off, as I now view it; I was a judge and a judge has no business to mess into such things." ...|$|E

If <b>I</b> killed <b>more</b> flesh <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if <b>I</b> sowed <b>more</b> corn <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no {{occasion}} for but to dress my food.|$|R

500|$|... "Yours" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} six minutes and thirty-nine seconds. It is set in common time in the key of F major and has a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Chapman's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of C4 to the high note of G5. The radio edit of the song has a length of four minutes and fifty seconds and {{contains}} a new verse (I’ve walked the valley of death’s shadow/So deep and dark that I could barely breathe/I’ve had {{to let go of}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear/And questioned everything that I believe/But still even here/in this great darkness/A comfort and hope come breaking through/As I can say in life or death/God we belong to you) which Chapman wrote in the weeks following the death of his daughter Maria, who had died on May 21, 2008 after having been accidentally hit by a car driven by her brother. Lyrically, the song describes the omnipotence of God and how [...] "God owns everything and is ever present in every place".|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have left a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E

I have had a truly fantastic period of my life with England. Winning the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies, my Test debut at Lords, a Test hat-trick against New Zealand, plus a Man of the Series award, {{are just a few of}} the highlights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{attention}} lavished on Kaasen and Balto, many mushers today consider Seppala and Togo {{to be the}} true heroes of the run, as they covered the longest and most hazardous leg. They made a round trip of [...] from Nome to Shaktoolik and back to Golovin, and delivered the serum a total of , almost double the distance covered by any other team. After Kaasen's return, {{he was accused of}} being a glory hog. Seppala became upset when the media attributed Togo's achievements to Balto, and commented, [...] "it was almost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear when the 'newspaper dog' Balto received a statue for his 'glorious achievements.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcing his}} {{retirement}} from swimming on 10 February 2015, Cowdrey stated: [...] "I have been {{fortunate to have}} achieved <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever have dreamed of, and more than I set out to achieve, and more importantly I have enjoyed every minute of my time on the Australian swim team." [...] Glenn Tasker, President of the Australian Paralympic Committee said that: [...] "It has been an absolute privilege to watch Matthew develop from the quiet 15-year-old kid who competed at his first Paralympics in 2004, {{into one of the}} greats of Australian Paralympic sport. He has become an outstanding ambassador for the Paralympic movement, a leader of the Paralympic swim team and our most successful athlete ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, all was {{not well}} within the group. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been {{completed}} in November 1985), and Marr {{was beginning to feel}} the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle." [...] Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin. [...] He allegedly received notice of his dismissal via a Post-it note stuck to the windscreen of his car. It read, [...] "Andy – you have left the Smiths. Goodbye and good luck, Morrissey." [...] Morrissey himself, however, denies this.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 Spin {{magazine}} rated The Queen is Dead as {{number one}} of [...] "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Spin {{was not alone}} in this designation—numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially The Queen is Dead, high on their best ever lists. NME, for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. However, a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule.

[...] Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin, although he was reinstated in short order. Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band – including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr—saw them on the verge of splitting.|$|E
