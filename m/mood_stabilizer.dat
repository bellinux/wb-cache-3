5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole). Although hypomanic episodes may respond to a <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> alone, full-blown episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E

40|$|<b>Mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have {{revolutionized}} {{the treatment of}} bipolar affective disorders. We review data originating from India {{in the form of}} efficacy, effectiveness, usefulness, safety and tolerability of <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> Data is mainly available for the usefulness and side-effects of lithium. A few studies in recent times have evaluated the usefulness of carbamazepine, valproate, atypical antipsychotics and verapamil. Occasional studies have compared two <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> Data for long term efficacy and safety is conspicuously lacking...|$|R
30|$|Four {{medication}} {{classes were}} analyzed: <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. <b>Mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> {{were defined as}} lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine. Second-generation antipsychotics are also effective <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> but were classified separately to better distinguish the medications taken and to enable comparison with prior research. Although controlled trials of an antimanic effect for benzodiazepines are lacking (Curtin and Schulz 2004), benzodiazepines were included since they are commonly prescribed to patients with bipolar disorder (Baldessarini et al. 2007; Simon et al. 2004).|$|R

25|$|Lamotrigine, {{originally}} {{marketed as}} Lamictal and available under many brands worldwide, is an anticonvulsant drug {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Like the anticonvulsant medications carbamazepine and valproate, lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> and was the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type II.|$|E
25|$|In bipolar disorder, SGAs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to rapidly control acute mania and mixed episodes, often in conjunction with mood stabilizers (which {{tend to have a}} delayed onset of action in such cases) such as lithium and valproate. In milder cases of mania or mixed episodes, <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> monotherapy may be attempted first. SGAs are also used to treat other aspects of the disorder (such as acute bipolar depression or as a prophylactic treatment) as adjuncts or as a monotherapy, depending on the drug. Both quetiapine and olanzapine have demonstrated significant efficacy in all three treatment phases of bipolar disorder. Lurasidone (trade name Latuda) has demonstrated some efficacy in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) {{issued a}} report stating that between 2010 and 2015, US Poison Centers {{received}} 660 reports of exposure to kratom. Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, moderate (non-life-threatening, with no residual disability, but requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures. One death was reported in {{a person who was}} exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer)</b> in addition to kratom. For 173 (26.2%) exposure calls, no effects were reported, or poison center staff members were unable to follow up again regarding effects.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{large-scale}} {{study found}} that severe depression in patients with bipolar disorder responds no better {{to a combination of}} antidepressant medications and <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> than it does to <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> alone and that antidepressant use does not hasten the emergence of manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.|$|R

40|$|<b>Mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> {{constitute}} {{a category of}} medications used {{in the management of}} mood disorders. The mood stabilizing properties of lithium were first discovered in 1949, and since then it has been considered the first line treatment for bipolar disorder. Despite presenting more differences than similarities, <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are all characterized by high variability in response in treated patients. This feature has inspired a vast research on potential predictive markers of clinical response, with promising but often inconclusive findings. Pharmacogenetics has provided valuable hints toward the involvement of specific genes and pathways in modulating response. However, with the exception of lithium, the number of studies is still too sparse to draw definite conclusions. Moreover, the mechanism of action of <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> has yet to be completely elucidated. A growing body of research has focused on the involvement of a group of specific molecular players involved in regulation of gene expression without interfering with the DNA sequence in response to <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> These processes, defined as epigenetics, represent the mechanisms through which our biological systems interact with environmental factors, including drug treatments. In this review we focused on findings from preclinical and clinical studies suggesting that <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers</b> may interfere with the epigenetic machinery, thus providing an intriguing perspective that may help us filling the gap between molecular functions and clinical efficacy of <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Treatment {{commonly}} includes psychotherapy, {{as well as}} medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Examples of mood stabilizers {{that are}} commonly used include lithium and various anticonvulsants. Treatment in a hospital without the individual's consent may be required {{if a person is}} at risk to themselves or others but refuses treatment. Severe behavioral problems, such as agitation or combativeness, may be managed with short term antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. In periods of mania it is recommended that antidepressants be stopped. If antidepressants are used for periods of depression they should be used with a <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), while not very well studied, may be helpful {{for those who do not}} respond to other treatments. If treatments are stopped, it is recommended that this be done slowly. Many individuals have financial, social or work-related problems due to the illness. These difficulties occur a quarter to a third of the time on average. The risk of death from natural causes such as heart disease is twice that of the general population. This is due to poor lifestyle choices and the side effects from medications.|$|E
500|$|The drug itself, lithium, is {{typically}} {{used as a}} <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> to prevent acute manic behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. Lee chose the title as a [...] "metaphor for happiness from a negative point of view": [...] "It's looking at it like, 'I don't want to numb myself and not feel anymore'." [...] She explained that during her process of writing music, she would get into a mood or a [...] "strange low that I ride" [...] that she would try to overcome by telling herself {{to let go of}} certain things, change and rejoice again; such experiences also inspired her to write [...] "Lithium". Initially, Lee was indecisive as to which song to choose as the second single from The Open Door, having in mind four different album tracks. [...] "Lithium" [...] was eventually chosen and made available for digital download on December 4, 2006. It was physically released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2007. [...] "The Last Song I'm Wasting on You", a track originally written for The Open Door and later included as a bonus track on several editions of the album, was the single's B-side.|$|E

2500|$|... (18 January 1912 – 16 November 1980) was an Australian {{psychiatrist}} {{credited with}} discovering (in 1948) {{the effects of}} lithium carbonate as a <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder (then known as manic depression). In an age where the standard treatments for psychosis were electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy, lithium had the distinction of being the first effective medication available to treat a mental illness.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium is {{the classic}} <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> to prevent further manic and {{depressive}} episodes. A systematic review found that long term lithium treatment substantially {{reduces the risk of}} bipolar manic relapse, by 42%. Anticonvulsants such as valproate, oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine are also used for prophylaxis. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine, which is another anticonvulsant. Clonazepam (Klonopin) is also used. [...] Sometimes atypical antipsychotics are used in combination with the previous mentioned medications as well, including olanzapine (Zyprexa) which helps treat hallucinations or delusions, Asenapine (Saphris, Sycrest), aripiprazole (Abilify), risperidone, ziprasidone, and clozapine which is often used for people who do not respond to lithium or anticonvulsants.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of Van Zandt's {{constant}} drinking, Harold Eggers, Kevin's brother, was hired on as his tour manager and 24-hour caretaker in 1976, a partnership that would last {{for the rest of}} the singer's life. Although the musician was many years older than he was, Eggers would later say that Van Zandt was his [...] "first child." [...] His battles with addiction led him to be admitted to rehab almost a dozen times throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Medical records from his time in recovery centers show that he believed his drinking had become a problem around 1973, and by 1982 he was drinking at least a pint of vodka daily. Doctors' notes reported: [...] "He admits to hearing voices, mostly musical voices", and [...] "Affect is blunted and mood is sad. Judgment and insight is impaired." [...] At various points in his life, he was prescribed to take the antidepressant Zoloft and the <b>mood</b> <b>stabilizer</b> lithium. His final and longest period of sobriety during his adult life was a period of about a year in 1989 and 1990.|$|E

2500|$|Michel went to San Damiano with {{a family}} friend who {{regularly}} organized such pilgrimages to places not officially recognized by the church. Her escort concluded that she was suffering from demonic possession because {{she was unable to}} walk past a crucifix and refused to drink the water of a holy spring. Both she and her family became convinced and consulted several priests, asking for an exorcism. The priests declined, recommended the continuation of medical treatment, and informed the family that exorcisms required the bishop's permission. In the Catholic Church, official approval for an exorcism is given when the person strictly meets the set criteria, then they are considered to be suffering from possession (infestatio) and under demonic control.
