[...] Inhibitors of enzymes that metabolize amphetamine (e.g., CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong its elimination half-life, meaning that its effects will last longer. [...] Amphetamine also interacts with , particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine); therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous. [...] Amphetamine modulates the activity of most psychoactive drugs. [...] In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants.

40|$|An increasing-temperature {{hot plate}} (ITHP) was {{introduced}} to measure the noxious heat threshold (45. 3 ± 0. 3 °C) of unrestrained rats, which was reproducible upon repeated determinations at intervals of 5 or 30 min or 1 day. Morphine, diclofenac and paracetamol caused an elevation of the noxious heat threshold following i. p. pretreatment, the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> being 3, 10 and 200 mg kg− 1, respectively. Unilateral intraplantar injection of the VR 1 receptor agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX, 0. 048 nmol) induced a profound drop of heat threshold to the innocuous range with a maximal effect (8 – 10 °C drop) 5 min after RTX administration. This heat allodynia was inhibited by pretreatment with morphine, diclofenac and paracetamol, the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> being 1, 1 and 100 mg kg− 1 i. p., respectively. The long-term sensory desensitizing effect of RTX was examined by bilateral intraplantar injection (0. 048 nmol per paw) which produced, after an initial threshold drop, an elevation (up to 2. 9 ± 0. 5 °C) of heat threshold lasting for 5 days. The VR 1 receptor antagonist iodo-resiniferatoxin (I-RTX, 0. 05 nmol intraplantarly) inhibited by 51 % the heat threshold-lowering effect of intraplantar RTX but not α,β-methylene-ATP (0. 3 μmol per paw). I-RTX (0. 1 or 1 nmol per paw) failed to alter the heat threshold either acutely (5 – 60 min) or on the long-term (5 days).

30|$|Consideration {{of these}} factors during {{appropriately}} close, long-term clinical monitoring should help to limit risks of renal impairment with long-term lithium treatment (Paul et al. 2010). In addition, there may be benefits in monitoring serum concentrations of lithium levels relatively frequently, especially in elderly patients. It {{has been suggested that}} lithium levels should be monitored every 3  months since even a single occurrence of a level higher than 1.0  mEq/L may result in a modest but significant decrease of the GFR lasting for at least 3  months (Bauer et al. 2006; Van Beneden et al. 2011; Kirkham et al. 2014; Davis et al. 2015; Shine et al. 2015).

40|$|Background Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a fatal genetic disorder caused by dystrophin gene mutations that preclude synthesis of a functional protein. One potential {{treatment of the}} disorder has utilised antisense oligoribonucleotides (AOs) to induce removal of disease-associated exons during pre-mRNA processing. Induced in-frame mRNA transcripts encode a shorter but functional dystrophin. We have investigated and improved the design of AOs capable of removing exon 23, and thus the disease-causing nonsense mutation, from mRNA in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Methods H− 2 Kb-tsA 58 mdx cultures were transfected with complexes of Lipofectin and AOs. Exon skipping was detected by RT-PCR and subsequent protein production was demonstrated by Western blotting. AOs were delivered at a range of doses in order to compare relative efficiencies. Results We describe effective and reproducible exon 23 skipping with several AOs, including one as small as 17 nucleotides. Furthermore, {{the location of a}} sensitive exon 23 target site has been refined, whilst <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> have been estimated in vitro. These doses are significantly lower than previously reported and were associated with the synthesis of dystrophin protein in vitro.

Because of the increasing importance of infections due to other species of Candida, we studied the efficacy of fluconazole in a rat model of established systemic candidiasis, using clinical isolates of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. Krusei. In normal rats, oral fluconazole at both 20 and 80 mg/kg per day for 7 days reduced both kidney and liver titers of C. tropicalis and C. glabrata compared with those in control animals and was only slightly inferior to amphotericin B. Both fluconazole and amphotericin B were ineffective in reducing kidney titers of C. krusei, but amphotericin B was more effective than fluconazole in reducing liver titers. Fluconazole showed no increased efficacy at the higher dose of 80 mg/kg per day compared with 20 mg/kg per day in any experiment.

Although there was a tendency for L- 689, 660 to reverse the scopolamine-induced (0. 4 mg/kg) performance deficit in a rat delayed-matching-to-position (DMTP) test, the difference failed to reach statistical significance.
