Online auction bidders can view photos, descriptions and suggested bids of items online, as opposed to items in a showroom. Most online auctions use a style of bidding called proxy bidding, in which the online system makes bids for the actual participant in increments up to the <b>maximum</b> <b>bidding</b> <b>amount</b> set by the participant.|$|R
25|$|Senior auction is a {{variation}} on the all-pay auction, and has a defined loser in addition to the winner. The top two bidders must pay their full final <b>bid</b> <b>amounts,</b> and only the highest wins the auction. The intent is to make the high bidders bid above their upper limits. In the final rounds of bidding, when the current losing party has hit their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> they are encouraged to <b>bid</b> over their <b>maximum</b> (seen as a small loss) to avoid losing their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> with no return (a very large loss).|$|R
40|$|It can be {{observed}} that in consumer-to-consumer on-line auctions, {{there is a strong}} degree of price dispersion, even in liquid markets with a large number of bids per auction item. This Thesis research strives to quantify such dispersion and present explanations for the key findings on the nature of price dispersion in on-line auctions of like goods: Although contrary to common sense and public opinion, I found no significant correlation of winning bid price with feedback rating. This is true for low, medium-high and high value goods and for both new and used goods. This observation holds for all ranges of feedback ratings. Of all of the other variables of an auction listing: (shipping costs, <b>amount</b> of opening <b>bid,</b> number of bids, accepted payment types, picture in listing, and the use of reserve prices), only picture in listing and use of reserve prices are correlated with winning bid price. This observation holds for all types of goods examined. However, correcting for these variables does not significantly reduce price dispersion. The majority of the dispersion in winning bid prices of same-good auctions {{can be explained by the}} unique ability of the on-line auction process to obtain the reservation prices of buyers in the market, through its use of <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> and proxy <b>bidding.</b> An auction winning bid curve for a good can be constructed by aggregating the winning bid prices of all auctions of that good over a period of time. The downward sloping and isoelastic nature of this curve can be explained in part by the downward sloping demand curve for that good, made up by the range of premiums buyers are willing to pay in order to increase their chances of winning the auction, and getting the item sooner. The exact shape of the curve can be further explained and in fact reconstructed by an examination of the statistics of grouping bids in auctions. Arbitrage to take advantage of the dispersion of winning bid prices can be shown to be possible, and in theory it appears to be surprisingly profitable. This suggests that on-line auction markets are only weakly market efficient. Several explanations were explored as to why arbitrage has not been pursued, thereby eliminating the observed dispersion. These explanations include the unseen non-monetary transaction and arbitrage costs, the level of sophistication necessary to capitalize on opportunities, and the persisting immaturity of the consumer-to-consumer on-line auction market. by Mark Andrew Perutz.

5000|$|Legitimate, non-sniping bidders may {{object to}} sniping, {{claiming}} {{that it is}} unfair to place bids at a point when it is impossible or unfeasible for other bidders to evaluate and possibly counter the bid, causing them to lose auctions even though {{they would have been}} willing to meet the winning <b>bid</b> <b>amount.</b> Bidders sometimes object to sniping when multiple identical items are listed as a separate lot, or on breakup auctions, where items that constitute a set are broken down and sold separately, as they must wait to find whether their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> on one lot has been exceeded before being in a position to decide whether to bid on another.|$|R

40|$|A {{potential}} {{concern in}} “multiple bounded discrete choice” contingent valuation surveys – where the respondent {{is asked to}} express voting certainty, rather than a simple yes or no, on {{a large number of}} payment <b>amounts</b> (<b>bids)</b> – is whether responses are influenced by the particular position of bids in the bid-voting panel rather than solely on the respondent’s willingness to pay (WTP). For instance, respondents may systematically state they would pay the first few <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> and not pay all subsequent bids – regardless of the actual dollar values. Such systematic bid design effects would suggest that this method does not provide a valid measure of WTP. Using a split-sample survey, we compare responses to three different bid arrays that have an identical minimum <b>bid,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> and number of bids. Using nonparametric estimation techniques, we find that estimated WTP distributions and corresponding welfare measures are not statistically different across survey samples.

50|$|Most auctions {{have the}} feature that {{participants}} submit <b>bids,</b> <b>amounts</b> of money {{they are willing}} to pay. Standard auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid. A nonstandard auction does not require this (e.g., a lottery).|$|R

40|$|Please do not quote without {{permission}} This paper proposes a simple statistical {{explanation for the}} phenomenon of extreme bids observed during house market booms.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of improving access to mammographic screening are estimated using a contingent valuation experiment conducted on 458 women in 19 rural Australian towns. The contingent valuation survey provides women {{with information on}} mammographic screening and uses a closed-ended format to elicit their willingness {{to pay for a}} visit of a mobile mammographic screening unit. Single and double-bounded versions of the discrete response contingent valuation method are employed in the estimation of willingness to pay. The double-bounded contingent valuation approach is shown to be biased due to respondents having a greater disposition to respond ‘no’ when the <b>bid</b> <b>amount</b> in the follow-up question is higher than the <b>bid</b> <b>amount</b> offered in the initial question. Several approaches to dealing with this bias are examined. ...|$|R

In this paper, we derive factors from transaction cost theory that explain the decision of a principal besides the <b>bid</b> <b>amount.</b> Based on an empirical analysis of bidding information extracted from Freelancer. com, we found that the <b>bid</b> <b>amount</b> has the highest effect on the decision of the principal followed by the number of reviews the freelancer has already received and the number of already conducted transactions between a freelancer and a principal. We also found that principals prefer freelancers who live in the same cultural area. Furthermore our results indicate that a gold membership has no effect on the decision of the principal which is of interest especially for those freelancers who believe they are considered to be more reliable as a gold member...|$|R

While this theory does not preclude behavioural explanations of extreme bids, it does demonstrate that a world free from strategic and idiosyncratic behaviour would not be a world free from extreme bids during boom periods. Therefore, when gauging the impact of strategic or idiosyncratic behaviour (either hypothetically or empirically) one has to measure the effect against a baseline regime where extreme bids are inevitable, not against a world that is free from extreme bids...|$|R
