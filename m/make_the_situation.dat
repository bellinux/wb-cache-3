25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{intensified}} {{clashes between}} the CPC and KMT, {{countries such as}} the US and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that {{the only ones to}} benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.|$|E

500|$|Around {{that time}} General Małachowski arrived at Fort 23 {{to inspect the}} part of the front he had {{neglected}} until that point. Informed by General Młokosiewicz of the loss of Fort 56, he ordered a counter-attack. More preoccupied with holding the second line than with retaking the first, he committed only two battalions (1,240 men) out of 12 he had in reserve to the assault. The counter-attack started around 13:00 and was supported by a token force of 14 pieces of horse artillery, while General Bem held 21 heavier field cannons in reserve. As soon as the Poles left their ramparts, the sortie came under fire of Russian artillery amassed in front of forts 54, 55 and 56. Despite heavy fire, the Poles reached a point [...] south-east of Fort 56, where they were met by elements of two Russian rifle regiments (1st and 2nd; ca. 1,800 men). Despite Russian numerical superiority, the Polish force broke through and pushed the Russians back, but was then defeated by Russian artillery on the eastern rampart of Fort 56. When Russian reinforcements appeared on both his flanks, the Polish commander sounded retreat and returned to the Polish lines. The Polish counter-attack failed. To <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> even more serious, the retreating Poles were followed closely by a large Russian force of the two rifle regiments, reinforced with elements of 1st, 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} whether {{adequate}} notice had been given was {{complicated by the fact}} that Tennessee law did not define what would count as adequate, and the issue had never been satisfactorily settled in court.

Its attorney, Josh McCreary, noted that the approval of the mosque had been a routine matter that had not been controversial at the time. He said that the public controversy had been stirred up by the plaintiffs after the fact to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> [...] "notorious".

2500|$|The month-long period before, {{during and}} after the Chinese New Year is known as Chunyun or [...] "spring transport" [...] for the China's railways. [...] During this period, train service {{increases}} to meet the demand from one of the largest annual human migrations in the world. [...] Since railway transport is the cheapest method for long distance travellers in China, the railway is the most important transport method during the Chunyun period. For example, during the 40 days of the 2007 Chunyun period, it is estimated that 156 million passengers rode trains, which corresponds to 3.9 million passengers per day, compared to the overall average of 2.4 million per day. To <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> even worse, traffic is highly imbalanced: before the Chinese New Year, passengers mainly travel from the large cities and after the holiday, the traffic reverses. Although hundreds of temporary trains are operated, train tickets are still in short supply. Trains are very crowded during this period, for example; a passenger car with 118 seats may accommodate more than 200 people.|$|E

2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa.

[...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't.

2500|$|One character, a slave {{companion}} for the Sith Warrior named Vette, drew controversy.

The Daily Mail ran {{an article about}} Fahey's story on their Mail Online website, remarking on how the option to treat Vette decently did not seem popular, and while noting Star Wars was [...] "no stranger to slavery" [...] said [...] "the idea of playing 'master' yourself is unsavoury". The Mail was criticised for its lack of evidence for its statements and its selective information. Forbes's Erik Kain criticised gaming as overly focused on [...] "teenage boys", calling {{the inclusion of a}} shock-collar-wearing slave [...] "not so much surprising as it is disappointing" [...] and [...] "really creepy". Kain commented how it enforced how gaming could be a [...] "hostile environment" [...] for girls and felt that the inclusion of choice failed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> better. The Mary Sue contributor Becky Chambers felt Vette's inclusion was less [...] "sexist" [...] than [...] "shortsighted". Religion Dispatches researched the matter, surveying 369 players to ask them how they acted. The survey's findings suggested that most players chose the good options and felt uncomfortable doing any evil ones. They suggested that the presence of characters like Vette influenced the player's actions, making them want to take choices that would gain Affection.|$|E
2500|$|Binge {{drinking}} is considered harmful, regardless of a person's age, {{and there have}} been calls for healthcare professionals to give increased attention to their patients drinking habits, especially binge drinking. Some researchers believe that raising the legal drinking age and screening brief interventions by healthcare providers are the most effective means of reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with binge drinking. Programs in the United States have thought of numerous ways to help prevent binge drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests increasing the cost of alcohol or the excise taxes, restricting the number of stores who may obtain a license to sell liquor (reducing [...] "outlet density"), and implementing stricter law enforcement of underage drinking laws. [...] There are also a number of individual counseling approaches, such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches, that have been shown to reduce drinking among heavy drinking college students. In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address binge drinking problems in patients. In August 2008, a group of college presidents calling itself the Amethyst Initiative asserted that lowering the legal drinking age to 18 (presumably) was one way to curb the [...] "culture of dangerous binge drinking" [...] among college students. This idea is currently the subject of controversy. [...] Proponents argue that the 21 law forces drinking underground and makes it more dangerous than it has to be, while opponents have claimed that lowering the age would only <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> worse. Despite health warnings, most Australian women drink at least one night a week.
