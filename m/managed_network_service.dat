Pervasive Computing is {{the trend}} towards {{increase}} {{the capacity of}} communication and the perfect human interaction with a quantity massive of contraptions and computational systems {{in a way that}} these interactions “dialogues ” are transparent and integrated {{in the context of the}} applications. To achieve this premise are necessaries Information Models as rich semantically as flexible to accommodate the most of aspects from context information. This paper explores and discusses the pertinent issues on “context information modelling ” to define and introduce a Context Information Model solid and extensible for <b>managing</b> context-aware <b>network</b> <b>services</b> into the pervasive computing environments which can be useful in architectures for <b>managing</b> <b>network</b> <b>services</b> that are context-aware. The Information Models analysis is supported on the extensive literature survey that was conducted to understand the current state of the art in context-aware service provisioning, the operator’s expectations, typical scenario/application descriptions, and fundamental requirements for provisioning context-aware <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> The activities are into the research framework of EU-IST project CONTEXT. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Most of the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> {{management}} systems rely on informal specifications, hard-coded programming and relational databases to store and <b>manage</b> <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> As a result, such systems {{may not be}} correct facing their requirements {{and they may not}} be flexible enough to perform <b>network</b> <b>service</b> management efficiently. This paper presents ongoing work toward an innovative approach, based on knowledge representation, to formally specify the contractual, administrative and technical contents of Service Level Agreements, and the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> management processes and their orchestration promoting <b>network</b> <b>service</b> autonomic management and configuration. By using a knowledge based formal framework and an inference engine capable of reasoning over concepts, relations and changes of state, it is possible to create a more flexible and robust ground for specifying and implementing autonomic and adaptive management tasks.
