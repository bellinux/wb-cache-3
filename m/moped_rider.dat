5000|$|The {{original}} Police Stop {{video was}} released in 1993 and, after receiving much publicity from The Sun, was very successful. This was followed by Police Stop 2, Police Stop 3 (both 1994) and Police Stop 4 (1995). Worst of Police Stop (1994) was a compilation of the first three, and a further release entitled Police Stop America was also released in 1994, featuring American only footage. The first video included an introduction by Inspector David Rowland, a traffic officer of the Metropolitan Police and had obtained the co-operation of several UK police forces, who contributed most of the material. Later videos increasingly included clips from elsewhere, primarily the United States and mainland Europe. Each video included several long car chases, interspersed with groups of shorter clips relating to a common theme such as unroadworthy vehicles or dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. Occasionally, a [...] "humorous" [...] clip was shown; the most famous example, used {{by a number of}} similar television programmes since, shows a <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> transporting a long plank of wood balanced across the back of his machine. All five videos were exempt from classification. From Police Stop 5 onwards, the programme was aired on Sky One and were never released on video. From this point onwards, the series continued to use more clips from non-UK sources. The series was transmitted on Sky One up until Police Stop 11, which was an all American special in 2002.|$|E
40|$|Until {{now there}} has been no {{obligation}} for moped riders to undergo driver training. If the driver is sixteen years old, he is permitted to drive a moped. It is shown from accident statistics that the number of sixteen year old traffic victims is much higher than of fifteen years old; more than half the traffic victims aged sixteen and seventeen are moped riders. Per vehicle mile the moped is the most dangerous transport mode; male moped riders have twice the chance of being involved in a fatal accident than female moped riders, and most moped accidents occur at a junction. Factors influencing the lack of traffic safety of moped riders {{can be found in the}} moped riders themselves, other road traffic, and traffic system and traffic provisions. Other traffic does not take into account the problems of the <b>moped</b> <b>rider,</b> but that is mostly caused by the attitude of the <b>moped</b> <b>rider.</b> Driver training could be useful, but modification in driving behaviour is difficult to achieve. The small effect of driver training is mainly due to its set-up. Recommendations for driver training, in particular for moped riders, are made...|$|E

40|$|The general {{question}} {{of this study}} is whether it is safer to let <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> drive on the carriageway instead of on the cycle track, within built-up areas. The study evaluates the 'moped on the carriageway' measure tested in three Dutch municipalities in November 1991 : Apeldoorn, The Hague, and Tiel. Using behavioural observations this evaluation was carried out as a before and after study. The main results of the study were as follows: (1) There were more encounters between <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> and other road users in the after study, but the number of encounters with hindrance appeared to be about the same; (2) The most hindrance appeared to take place, when <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> or "snorfietsers" were using the cycle track (63 %), but the hindrance on the carriageway seemed to be slightly more dangerous; (3) In the after study, 15 % of the <b>moped</b> <b>riders,</b> who were supposed to drive on the carriageway, used the cycle track; (4) The measure did not have any influence on the average speed of car traffic; and (5) the estimated speed of <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> increased in the after study compared with the before study. The results of the study show that attention should be paid to the speed behaviour of <b>moped</b> <b>riders,</b> when they are driving on the carriageway, using the cycle track (63 %) ...|$|R

The paper also contains an accident analysis of both road user groups regarding the 1987 - 1989 period. The paper presents the fatal injury risk figures, per travelled kilometre, for both cyclists and for moped riders over the 1986 - 1988 period.

40|$|In {{the study}} on the redivision and {{reconstruction}} of Eindhoven, the improvement of junctions in the ring road was mentioned. These junctions have special bicycle provisions. The effect of the introduction of traffic signal control and conflict free phases for cyclists and <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> at these junctions is studied. Before the introduction many accidents occurred, {{due to the fact}} that cyclists and <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> rode straight through, and the car-drivers went to the right thus crossing the route of the cyclists and <b>moped</b> <b>riders.</b> By introducing conflict free phases in the traffic signal control of these junctions, it is shown that these conflict free phases have a significantly useful effect on the number of accidents of through, going and <b>moped</b> <b>riders,</b> in which a lorry or bus was involved.

It is shown that the effect of cycle tracks is favourable on road sections between junctions; that the effect of cycle tracks on junctions is different from that on road sections between the junctions, but not unfavourable per se; and that problems with the safety of cycle tracks are mainly related to <b>moped</b> <b>riders...</b>|$|R

40|$|In a {{literature}} survey for an accident investigation project, {{the relatively high}} number of crash helmets that came off during an accident, was noticed. Therefore {{it was decided to}} study this aspect in more detail. A specific literature survey into "coming off" rates and an inventory of the possible causes was made. The results of this survey showed that the coming off rates, reported in literature, ranged from 7 % to 36 %. It also appeared that accident investigation projects can only detect part of the causes e. g. mechanical failure of the retention system. One of the other causes - improper use of the retention system - could only be inspected when the <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> had stopped. More than 1100 moped riders were interviewed and their helmets examined. In this report the result of the survey are described...|$|E
30|$|The road {{exposure}} of moped riders {{is expected to}} increase by 0.3 – 0.8 % and the road {{exposure of}} motorcyclists by 0.1 %– 0.8 % with use of the system. In addition to changes related to direct exposure (new and longer trips), impacts are also expected on modal change, which is estimated to increase <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> exposure by 0.1 – 0.7 % and the road exposure of motorcyclists by 0.1 %– 0.7 %. These exposure changes were assumed based on studies relating to risk perception and subjective safety impacts on modal choice (see e.g. [39]). These changes was expected to be especially relevant to the group of motorcyclists which shows comparatively high levels of insecurity and a lack of subjective safety in traffic [40 – 42]. Therefore, the estimated increase in PTW trips is expected to result from a more optimistic safety perception of this mode of transport.|$|E

40|$|Wearing a {{crash helmet}} is an {{important}} contribution to road safety. If a helmet is worn, the risk of being killed in a motorcycle crash decreases by about 42 %. In the Netherlands, compulsory crash helmet wearing for motorcyclists was introduced in 1972, and the obligation for <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> followed in 1975. Compulsory helmet wearing became generally accepted after its introduction. In spite of this, about 25 % of <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> and 13 % of motorcyclists admitted to hospital after a crash still have severe head/skull injuries. This may partly be caused by the helmet not being fastened properly. Especially the percentage of <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> properly wearing the helmet has not increased, despite intensified police enforcement. SWOV recommends a more targeted enforcement and more public information...|$|R
40|$|In {{literature}} {{high numbers}} of helmets that came off during accidents are reported. Percentages range from 7 to 36 %. Because {{only a part of}} these cases could be explained by (mechanical) failure of the retention systems of the helmets a survey of the use of these systems by <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> and motorcyclists was undertaken in the Netherlands. The results of this project indicate that the use of the retention systems of helmets especially by <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> is not quite optimal in the Netherlands. A similar use of the retention systems in the Federal Republic of Germany is indicated. The results of this research also indicate that an improve of the use of the buckle can be achieved for the <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> when only "push button" systems are used...|$|R
40|$|In a field {{experiment}} on <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> training, young moped riders were tested one week before, {{two weeks after}} and eleven months after participation in a practical moped riding training course. As a result of rider training the group trainees performed considerably better at a riding task than the group non-trainees {{two weeks after the}} training. However, this performance difference was not present anymore at follow-up testing 11 months later. The group that did not follow the course significantly improved their driving skill. However, the group that had already improved their driving skill with the training, did not improve any further. Those moped riders that improved most from the 16 -h training course at the post-test also declined in performance considerably at the long term follow-up. Knowledge that relies of an understanding of how behaviour should change in a dynamic situation was more strongly related to actual riding skill than knowledge that was based on memorising fairly straightforward situation-rule connections.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the project for priority for slow traffic from the right this report discusses the relationships between driving speed, impact speed, and consequences of collisions between two-wheeled vehicles and cars. With the aid of a simple phase model of the collision process the problem is described on the level of the moped-rider or cyclist. There are two main relationships mentioned, namely those between the driving speed and impact speed and those between impact speed and outcome. Those main relationships and parts of them are studied in two ways; theoretically, with the aid of systematics from physics, and by means of data from accident studies. Conclusions from the theoretical part are affirmed by practice and relate to the incompatibility between two wheeled vehicles and motor vehicles. The result of a collision between these categories is almost always unfavourable for the <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> or the cyclist, mainly caused by the great difference in the mass of the vehicle and the difference in the structural properties of the vehicles. Fatal two-wheeler accidents can be avoided when the impact speed of the motor vehicle is lower than 30 km/hour...|$|E
40|$|In this report, {{the extent}} of safety of moped and {{low-speed}} moped riders (In Dutch: "snorfietsers") {{in the province of}} Zeeland and relevant measures are studied. First of all, the Zeeland accident data was analysed to establish the extent and development of safety of mopeds and light-speed mopeds. National data were included {{to be able to make}} a comparison with the rest of the country. With 19 % of the national total, and compared to the other eleven provinces, Zeeland has the highest share of moped and light-speed <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> in-patients.

The report considers a number of (planned) national measures for improving moped and light-speed moped riders' safety. The report concentrates on the description of a number of specific activities aimed at older moped or light-speed moped riders, speeds of mopeds and light-speed mopeds, and the extent to which crash helmets are used (properly). Speeds and (correct) helmet use are covered in relation to the increased police surveillance.

40|$|Increases in fatal {{and serious}} {{injuries}} involving powered two wheelers (PTWs) have largely mirrored increases and sales and usage in the United States and Australia. Moped (up to 50 cc) and scooter {{sales in the}} State of Queensland, Australia, tripled {{in the three years}} to 2008 and there was a fourfold increase in reported moped crashes between 2001 and 2005. Queensland is one of the Australian jurisdictions where a moped can be legally ridden with a car licence, while a motorcycle licence is required to ride a larger capacity scooter. Currently there is limited research on moped safety in Australia, though it appears that while fatalities are relatively few, non-fatal <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> injuries are similarly severe to those of motorcyclists. This paper reports an exploratory study of moped and scooter riders’ attitudes and experiences in Brisbane, Queensland. Four focus group discussions were held in March 2009, with a total 23 participating riders of varying age and experience. All riders agreed that economy, practicality, time-efficiency and enjoyment were motivations for moped or scooter use. There was also universal agreement on other vehicles representing the primary hazard to their safety. Compared with riders of larger scooters, moped riders without a motorcycle licence were generally less knowledgeable about safety issues and did not value rider training. These and other emergent themes are discussed {{in the context of their}} road safety implications...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not often}} that a new vehicle is introduced, {{and for this reason}} alone it is an {{interesting}} subject of research. Having been. asked by the Minister of Transport and Waterways of The Netherlands to give its views in the form of advice, regarding the likely consequences upon road safety of introducing a low-speed moped, the Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV was therefore glad to comply with this request. But the condition that the report had to be made within three months of the request, was a major limiting factor. In such a short time it is impossible to carry out thorough scientific research, and resort has to be had to data already available or else obtainable at short notice. This limitation was all the more important for this advice because few of the data really required were available in an adequate or reliable form. This applies particularly to statistics of the proportion of cyclists and moped-riders among road users. It therefore proved to be necessary to arrange interviews specially for these investigations which would at the same time provide an opportunity to find out something more about potential low-speed moped users. Since little time was available, these interviews, however, were of limited scope. Nevertheless, an effort has been made even with this somewhat sketchy information to express an opinion about the likely effect of the low-speed moped on road safety. It must be stressed, however, that this opinion applies only within the peripheral conditions stated in SWOV's terms of reference: that is to say that this vehicle must be regarded as an ordinary moped (conform the Dutch law) but subject to several different rules: (a) its top speed. is 20 kms/hr; (b) the rider and passenger are released from the obligation to wear crash helmets. Otherwise, the rider is subject to the same rules as the ordinary <b>moped</b> <b>rider</b> in The Netherlands; he will have to be at least 16 years of age. In this advisory report some opinions are expressed on a number of these peripheral conditions, especially some of the rules of conduct and the user's release from the obligation to wear a crash helmet...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{the safety}} of teens in early {{licensing}} countries has been extensively studied, {{little is known about}} {{the safety of}} pre-license teens in late licensing countries, where these teens also may be at risk. This risk exists because of the combination of a) increasing use of travel modes with a high injury risk, such as bicycles and mopeds, b) inexperience, and c) teens’ developmental stage, known to be associated with risk taking and novelty seeking, especially among males. To explore the magnitude and nature of pre-license road risk, this study analysed epidemiological data from the Netherlands, and hypothesized that in this late licensing country, ‘independent travel’ and the use of riskier modes of transport increase among pre-license teens 10 to 17 years of age, resulting in higher fatality rates, with ‘experience’ and ‘gender’ as risk modifying factors. National travel and fatality data of pre-license adolescents in the Netherlands were analysed by traffic role (cyclist, pedestrian, car passenger and <b>moped</b> <b>rider),</b> and compared to a younger age group (0 – 9 years) and an older age group (18 + years). The study of travel data showed that teens migrate from being car occupants to being users of riskier modes of transport, specifically bicycles and mopeds. This migration resulted in a strong rise in road fatalities, illustrating the importance of mobility patterns for understanding changes in road fatalities in this age group. The data further suggested a protective role of early cycle experience for young adolescent cyclists, particularly for young males. But further study into the underlying mechanism is needed to confirm this relationship. Moped risk was extremely high, especially among young males, and even higher than that of young male car drivers. The study confirmed the importance of changes in mobility patterns for understanding the rising road mortality when youngsters enter into their teens. The focus on fatalities has led to an underestimation of the magnitude of the problem because of the physical resilience of young adolescents that leads to high survival rates but probably also to long term disabilities. In addition, to explore the generalizability of these results, international comparisons among and between early and late licensing countries are necessary, especially in relation to moped riding as an alternative for car driving.

The average accident rate of all <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> appears {{to be higher than}} the rate of cyclists, but considerably lower than the accident rates of motorcyclists and motorcar drivers. An attempt has been made to determine the influence on the accident rate of: 1) age of the driver; 2) driving experience; 3) town or countryside; 4) type of moped; and 5) being in possession of a driver's licence (for <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> no driver's license is required in The Netherlands). The 16 - and 17 -years old <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> have an accident rate of more than twice the rate of the group of 18 - en 19 -years old. The driving experience seems to be a very important factor; experienced drivers are relatively safer. Being in possession of a driver's license (a criterion for the knowledge of traffic rules) and the type of moped (slow and fast types) are of little influence on the accident rate. The group of rural moped drivers have a lower accident rate than the inhabitants of towns. The first group however, is more frequently involved in the single vehicle type of accidents...|$|R
40|$|Objective and {{subjective}} road {{safety of the}} Rhenen-Achterberg intersection on the N 233 provincial road : Inventory of concerns among residents, survey among (parents of) students and assessment of the current and future traffic situation. The province of Utrecht asked SWOV to investigate the objective {{and subjective}} traffic safety {{at the intersection of}} the Bergweg/Achterbergsestraatweg and provincial road N 233. It is an intersection between a 80 km/h rural distributor road under the authority of the province of Utrecht and a 50 km/h urban distributor respectively 60 km/h semi-urban access road under the authority of the municipality of Rhenen. Along the N 233 there are separate (one-way) cycle paths. The intersection is signal controlled and has separate at-grade bicycle and pedestrian crossing facilities. Parallel to the N 233 is a railway line. The railway crossing is at grade but fully guarded. The intersection is relatively busy. In the near future the province of Utrecht wants to redesign and upgrade the N 233. In the new situation extra through lanes on the N 233 will be provided to increase capacity at the intersection and extra lanes will be constructed on the Achterbergsestraatweg-East. The N 233 will also be provided with a physical median {{in the form of a}} centre island. On the west side a bicycle link will also be constructed between Achterbergsestraatweg-West and the cycle path along the southern part of the N 233. The bicycle and pedestrian crossings remain at-grade crossings. New traffic signals and adapted signal plans will be implemented. The new timing plans provide for a dedicated (conflict-free) signal phase for cyclists (green light for all cyclists while all other traffic has a red signal). In this way conflicts cannot occur if all road users abide by the rules. The residents action group WWVO (abbreviation of ‘We Want to Cross Safely’ in Dutch) considers the intersection dangerous and does not agree that the proposed new design of the Province will resolve the problems. The residents action group is concerned about cyclists (mainly students) who need to cross the intersection. WWVO has prepared an alternative design for the intersection which incorporates a grade separated crossing for traffic crossing from East to West and vice versa. The study addresses the following research questions: 1. What are the concerns of WWVO regarding the N 233 intersection Rhenen-Achterberg and can these concerns be objectified 2. How can the concerns of WWVO be objectively measured and what is the outcome? 3. Do the reconstruction proposals take into account the observed road (safety) problems and do these proposals meet the road safety requirements? Does the design of the new situation take into account possible red light violations, near misses, bicycle-bicycle conflicts, presence and violations of freight traffic, cycling speed from the Bergweg and driving speeds? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a grade-separated junction for a safe crossing? The study was carried out by conducting an extensive interview with members of WWVO and with the municipality of Rhenen to make an inventory of their concerns. In addition, traffic counts were carried out and camera footage was taken of the intersection to assess the concerns. A crash analysis was completed and a attitudinal survey was held among secondary school students and parents of children who have to cross the intersection. Finally, the design proposals of the province of Utrecht and WWVO were assessed. Concerns WWVO In an extensive interview with WWVO the project group revealed seven primary concerns about the current and future traffic situation at the intersection. These were (in no particular order) : - Segregation effect resulting in changed travel patterns (called changed travel demand, resulting from fewer trips by bicycle, detours, trips accompanied by parents etc.) - red light violations - near-misses - bicycle-bicycle conflicts - freight transport - downhill cycling speed - driving speeds at the intersection. Crash analysis It should be noted that crash analyses use data from the police crash registration. Since 2010, the registration rate of the (injury) crashes has declined considerably in comparison with previous years. In addition, the registration rate of non-fatal crashes (and especially of crashes with material damage only) has always been low. Therefore it is very likely that the registered crash data for this location in the period after 2010 are even less complete than the registered data in the period before 2010. Consequently the number of (injury) crashes according to the registration is an underestimation of the actual number of crashes at the intersection. An analysis of the registered crashes in the period 2000 - 2013 shows that 33 crashes occurred during this period, 12 of which were injury crashes. The 18 casualties in these crashes sustained injuries ranging from minor injury to injury that required hospitalization. No fatal crashes occurred on the intersection during this period. Most crashes were side impacts or rear-end collisions. Passenger cars were the predominant mode involved in crashes (42 vehicles) and in a small number of cases they were slow traffic (one cyclist, one slow <b>moped</b> <b>rider,</b> and five moped riders). No crashes were recorded involving pedestrians. In a previous quick-scan, SWOV conducted an analysis on the crash data for the period 2001 - 2009. In this period 16 crashes were registered, 11 of which were injury crashes and none were fatal. The crashes in the period 2001 - 2009 present a slightly alarming picture. The intersection could be labelled a ' black spot ', depending on which years are considered and which definition of a black spot is applied (generally more than six injury crashes in three years). Due to the declining registration rate since 2010, it is unknown whether this location still could be regarded as a black spot. Changed travel demand The survey among (parents of) school-age children who have to cross the intersection shows that in the current situation few children make a detour because parents or children find the intersection unsafe (segregation effect). This is the case both for children in primary school as well as in secondary school. On the basis of the survey we estimate approximately 10 % of trips are affected by the segregation effect of the intersection. Furthermore, the survey reveals that relatively more primary school children in the ages from 8 to 12 years old are accompanied (by parents or older children) when travelling to school than was found for Dutch children nationally. Also the age at which children travel to school independently is higher in Achterberg and environment than was found in the earlier Dutch study (10 years old in Achterberg vs 8 years old nationally). It is also noticeable that relatively many primary school children are brought to school by car. The number of children who walk to school is low and this is possibly due to the distance between home and primary school. The question of how children would be allowed to go to school if the intersection was to be provided with a grade-separated crossing facility (e. g. an overpass), shows a remarkable shift. In the age group of children of 4 - 7 years old, 23 % would be allowed to cycle to school independently, compared to 2 % in the current situation. Considering the big shift, this outcome is difficult to interpret. The data for children nationally reveal that children in this age group are generally escorted to school and do not travel independently. The same picture emerges for the 8 - 12 -year-old primary school students. The shift is even bigger for this age group: the number of children that would be allowed to cycle independently would increase to as much as 88 %, compared to 43 % in the current situation. Once again this result does not match the national trend where the proportion travelling independently is much lower. Therefore the interpretation of this data must be done with some care: it is not certain that a grade-separated junction would actually result in such a big shift in travel patterns. However, it is clear that many parents would consider an alternative transport mode for their school-going children. Present traffic situation The traffic volumes on the main approaches of the intersection (in the direction of the crossing) are high: in the peak hours an average of about 650 motor vehicles per hour per approach. The volumes in the peak hours are close to the maximum capacity of the intersection. The traffic volumes on the minor approaches are considerably lower with a daytime average of about 160 motor vehicles per hour per approach. The ratio between traffic on the minor and major approaches is around 0. 25. This is more favourable for road safety than a more equal distribution. Generally, the bicycle volumes are below 100 bicycles per hour (also during the peak hours) with the exception of the southern branch of the N 233 in the morning peak (about 150 bicycles per hour). According to CROW standards bicycle volumes are considered relatively low, also during rush hours. Camera footage shows that in the current situation both cyclists and motor vehicles often ignore the red signal: on average one vehicle (cyclist or motor vehicle) per 34 minutes. Other offences were not as frequently observed at the current intersection. Illegal or incorrect overtaking, merging by motor vehicles and transverse crossing by cyclists sporadically occur. No bicycle-bicycle conflicts were observed, and neither were dangerous situations between buses and other traffic. The proportion of freight traffic on the N 233 is between 5 % and 10 % and is low to normal in comparison with general volumes on similar provincial distributor roads. The average speed of motorized traffic on the N 233 varies between 48 km/h and 74 km/h. The speed driven by 85 % of the traffic, the so-called V 85, varies between 65 km/h and 87 km/h. The average speed of the freight traffic is lower and the V 85 of freight traffic does not exceed 80 km/h. The speed of cyclists on the Bergweg-West (downhill towards the junction with the N 233) is about 23 km/h, which is higher than what CROW considers to be 'normal' (15 - 20 km/h). Assessment design proposals In general the design of a signalized intersection as proposed by the province meets the current design requirements for an intersection between a distributor road and an access road in rural areas. However, the proposed design can be improved. Due to the large speed differences (mainly between motorized traffic and cyclists/pedestrians) at the intersection, speed-reducing measures (such as a raised junction or speed humps on the approaches) are recommended. The speeds on the intersection should be limited to a maximum of 50 km/h. Enforcement using recognizable red light and speed cameras (set to a limit of 50 km/h) remains important. It is recommended that these camera’s cover both approaches of the N 233; currently there is only one camera. The Bergweg-West is a 50 km/h distributor road and should have separate cycle paths. The detailed design should take into account a higher design speed for cyclists than the speed that is normally common for solitary moped/bicycle paths. This is especially the case for the downhill stretch towards the intersection with the N 233. The bicycle facilities at the intersection should have an immediate connection with the bicycle facilities of the adjacent road section Bergweg-West. The proximity of the T-junction with Bergweg-East can lead to confusing traffic situations, especially for cyclists that use the Bergweg. The construction of a threshold treatment, a raised cycle path or even a raised junction should be considered. The sketch design of WWVO offers a grade-separated solution with a 3 -arm roundabout. This proposal provides no insight into the layout of the intersections, the alignment and cross-sectional profile, and therefore this proposal was assessed at a sketch plan level. In the WWVO-design the traffic to and from Achterbergsestraatweg and Bergweg-East is redirected to a grade-separated intersection to the south of the current intersection. Bicycle traffic from the part of Rhenen situated at the southeast of the intersection, gets a new bicycle connection between the Boslandweg and Bergweg-West. For these cyclists this connection is shorter, more direct and, because of the grade-separated junction with the N 233, safer than the current connection. The current intersection is converted to a 3 -arm roundabout. This alternative offers a solution for a number of potential road safety problems on the intersection (especially lateral conflicts with intersecting traffic) but at the same time introduces new problems. For traffic from Achterberg this solution causes detours, whereby both cyclists and motorized traffic need to use a longer, indirect connection (a detour of about 400 metres). By diverting the traffic, the traffic volume on the Achterbergsestraatweg-West increases. This longer travel distance on an unsafer road type has negative road safety consequences. In this design, the road sections and intersections of the connections should be constructed in accordance with Sustainable Safety requirements. It must be investigated whether this solution is acceptable for the current road users. At locations where large volumes of slow traffic (for example, a main cycle route) cross a busy distributor road, it is advisable to construct a grade-separated bicycle or pedestrian bridge or tunnel. However, these are not evident at the intersection between the N 233 and the Bergweg/ Achterbergsestraatweg. The road crash details (based on old data from 2001 to 2009) are slightly alarming, but not due to crashes involving vulnerable road users. Conflict-observations in the current situation do not present an alarming picture either. Therefore, a grade-separated solution does not seem warranted. Even with an increase in bicycle traffic, a grade-separated solution does not seem to be appropriate. Given the outcome of the survey, an increase in bicycle traffic is not likely and the number of cyclists will remain about the same, even with a new grade-separated bridge. Finally Due to high traffic volumes and large differences in speed, direction and mass, intersections and interchanges on through roads (always) have a grade-separated construction. Also within Sustainable Safety a grade-separated intersection is a unique predictability characteristic of a through road. Intersections on distributor roads (such as the N 233) are generally at grade. At locations where large numbers of slow traffic (e. g. a main cycle route) cross a busy distributor road, it is recommended to construct a grade-separated bicycle or pedestrian bridge or tunnel. In the situation that was investigated here, large numbers of cyclists and pedestrians were not observed. Even taking into account an unlikely modal shift from the current supervised trip to school (mainly by car) to a future independent journey to school by bicycle, (such as the results of the survey suggest), volumes would still not warrant grade separation. A very common solution for this type of situation is an at-grade intersection, supported with median islands, speed reducing measures and, if necessary, a signalized intersection. A starting point of Sustainable Safety and the CROW Road Design Manual is that roundabouts are preferable at 4 -arm intersections between 80 km/h distributor roads and 60 km/h access roads. However, this is subject to local conditions (capacity, space, integration and so on). If a roundabout is not feasible and traffic volumes allow it, a priority controlled intersection is the correct solution. If a roundabout is not feasible and traffic volumes are high, a signal controlled intersection is preferred, preferably in combination with speed reducing measures. The findings of the present study provide no reason to deviate from the CROW and SWOV-recommendations for intersections on rural distributor roads. The study takes into account the current and future traffic volumes on the intersection between the N 233 and the Bergweg/Achterbergsestraatweg (including the relatively limited number of cyclists), the current level of road safety and the road safety level experienced by residents. To a large extent concurring with the plans of the Province, we recommend signal control with improved capacity and speed control measures for this intersection. This does justice to local environmental factors and to traffic and road safety elements. It is however recommended to monitor road safety and traffic behaviour on and near the intersection after the reconstruction. Furthermore, the main branches of the intersection must be equipped with speed-reducing facilities, supported by red light/speed camera's that are set to a limit of 50 km/h. The design should pay special attention to crossing cyclists, so that these are protected against conflicts with fast traffic both in time and in space. The Bergweg-West is a 50 km/h distributor road and should have separate cycle paths. For this approach (especially the downhill section in the direction of the N 233) the higher speeds of cyclists should be taken into account in the detailed design. The bicycle facilities at the intersection must have a direct connection to the bicycle facilities of the adjoining road sections; this connection is now absent on the western branch. The proximity of the T-connection with the Bergweg-East can lead to confusing traffic situations, especially for cyclists that use the Bergweg. A solution in the form of a threshold construction, a raised bicycle path, or even a raised junction should be considered. The current number and type of crashes, the traffic situation (including conflicts) and the future traffic situation (especially the numbers of cyclists) at the intersection do not give rise to considering the construction of a grade-separated (bicycle or pedestrian) bridge or tunnel. This is subject to the condition that the above design improvements for the at-grade solution are applied...|$|E

An {{accident}} study was performed in the form of a 'before' (November 1988 -October 1991) and 'after' (1992) study with experimental and control areas. The municipalities of Apeldoorn, Tiel, and The Hague participated in the trial. On a number of roads within their built-up areas, <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> were asked to move from the cycle track to the carriageway on November 1, 1991.

The same result is found for the number of accident victims. In particular, accidents between <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> and cyclists, and between <b>moped</b> <b>riders</b> and motor vehicles have been considerably reduced. Although the overall effect of the measure appears to be favourable after one year, there are still insufficient grounds to already introduce it on a large scale.

In addition, while the favourable effect could be demonstrated in Apeldoorn and The Hague, it was not seen in Tiel...|$|R
