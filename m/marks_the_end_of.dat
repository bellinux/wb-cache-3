5|$|According to some sources, 26 April <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this battle, {{although}} {{less severe}} and isolated clashes {{in that region}} continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of the}} month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E

5|$|Romulus Augustulus (c. AD 460–after AD 476; {{apparently}} {{still alive}} {{as late as}} AD 507), formally known as Romulus Augustus, was a Roman emperor and alleged usurper who ruled the Western Roman Empire from 31 October AD 475 until 4 September AD 476. His deposition by Odoacer traditionally <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Empire in the West, the fall of Ancient Rome, {{and the beginning of}} the Middle Ages in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Algoman orogeny {{occurred}} 2800 to , and it <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the crust-building Archean Eon.

Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, granitic extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).|$|E
5|$|The Grand Duchy's {{population}} was 65% Polish but with its exclusion of serfs and underrepresentation of landless rural commoners the electoral law {{was designed to}} favor the German inhabitants. The proportion of Polish representatives diminished further after the events of 1848, and Jacek Jędruch notes that due to growing discrimination against Polish representatives that date <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the period in which}} this legislative body can be seen as continuing the Polish parliamentary tradition. Also, while the proceedings of the first sejms were published in Polish, since 1877 they were published in German.|$|E

5|$|From Escanaba, M-35 runs {{concurrently}} with US2 and US41 to Gladstone, where M-35 logs {{its highest}} average annual daily traffic (AADT) counts. The 2012 AADT {{figures show that}} 14,744vehicles use the highway per day on a segment in north Escanaba. Between the two cities, US2/US41/M-35 crosses the Escanaba River near the mouth {{just south of the}} paper mill. North of the Escanaba, the highway follows the shoreline of Little Bay de Noc to Gladstone. M-35 separates from US2/US41 at an intersection with 4th Avenue North in Gladstone. This also <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the National Highway System, Lake Michigan Circle Tour and Pure Michigan Byway designations on M-35.|$|E

5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|Its {{northern}} boundary (Roosevelt Road) <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> consecutively named east-west streets. East-west streets {{north of}} Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets {{in this neighborhood}} from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) {{are two of the}} few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E
5|$|At Merriweather, M-64 turns easterly again, {{this time}} merging with M-28 and {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour. The two highways run together along the northern end of Lake Gogebic to Bergland. Turning north once again, M-64 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. The highway runs through more dense forests parallel to the Big Iron River on this north–south leg. The trunkline leaves the national forest as it passes into the community of White Pine, and the road runs near a former copper mine in the area. M-64 approaches the shores of Lake Superior at Silver City. There, it meets the eastern terminus of the former M-107, a highway designation that ran west into the Porcupine Mountains along the current 107th Engineers Memorial Highway. M-64 turns east along Lake Superior following the shoreline to the outskirts of Ontonagon. The highway crosses the Ontonagon River and terminates on the eastern shore. The current intersection with US45 that <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> M-64 {{on the south side of}} downtown is also the western terminus of M-38.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, {{the social and economic}} rationale for sustaining them had vanished. With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.|$|E
5|$|Near Cooley Law School Stadium at the {{intersection}} with Michigan Avenue, BL I-96 meets the Capitol Loop, Lansing's third business loop. The two highways run concurrently south of Michigan Avenue as Cedar Street angles southeasterly. The two directions of BL I-96 merge at an interchange with I-496 that also <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Capitol Loop. South of this interchange, Cedar Street continues as a five-lane street through a commercial corridor {{on the south side}} of Lansing. The business loop crosses the Red Cedar River three blocks south of the I-496 interchange. On either side of the business loop, the adjacent neighborhoods are residential in character. South of an intersection with Jolly Road, Cedar Street starts angling southeasterly. BL I-96 ends at an indirect interchange with I-96 near the Edgewood Town Center.|$|E
