5|$|After <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> success under {{head coach}} Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium.

The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple's live {{shows were}} from the start very loud and hard rocking and their stage set {{included}} stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses.

5|$|In April 2011, after <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{proposals}} and delays, construction began {{on a major}} upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, {{and would have been}} very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Germans {{responsible}} for {{the operation of the}} camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and executed.

5|$|After <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{ambitious and}} {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, {{even though she}} looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|After <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{evaluating}} a {{wide range}} of alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E

5|$|Hare's {{marriage}} was not consummated, and following {{an affair with}} a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745. Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected owing to her French nationality. After <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband James Townsend, whom she had married at age 18.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a web of alliances surrounding Bulgaria. By 965/966, the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute {{that was part of the}} peace agreement and declared war on Bulgaria. Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East, Nikephoros resolved to fight the war by proxy and invited the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria.|$|E
