5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

40|$|Sentimentalism, {{the idea}} that the {{emotions}} or sentiments are crucial to <b>moral</b> <b>judgment,</b> has a long and distinguished history. Throughout this history, sentimentalists have often viewed themselves as offering a more naturalistically respectable account of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment.</b> In this paper, I’ll argue that they have not been naturalistic enough. The early, simple versions of sentimentalism met with decisive objections. The contemporary sentimentalist accounts successfully dodge these objections, but only by promoting an account of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> that is far too complex to be a plausible account of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> on the ground. I argue that recent evidence on <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> indicates that emotional responses do indeed {{play a key role in}} everyday <b>moral</b> <b>judgment.</b> However, the emotions themselves are only one part of moral judgment; internally represented rules make an independent contribution to <b>moral</b> <b>judgment.</b> This account of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> is grounded in the empirical evidence, but it can also handle a cluster of desiderata that concern philosophical sentimentalists. If emotions and rules do make independent contributions to <b>moral</b> <b>judgment,</b> this raises a puzzle. For our rules tend to be well coordinated with our emotions. In the final section, I’ll argue that this coordination ca...|$|R

25|$|Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone (2010), the originators of this {{scientific}} understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly {{recruited from the}} public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the McGrath Task Circumplex, a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective <b>moral</b> <b>judgments,</b> and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a factor analysis. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor c underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a general individual intelligence factor g typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.|$|E

Secondary aims were to determine whether the data obtained indicated significant sex differences in level of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> and to compare the mean level of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> of the experimental and control groups with existing research. A statement and motivation of the problem and clarification of concepts were followed by an evaluation of applicable pre-Kohlbergian research, the philosophical foundations of Kohlberg’s theory and the theory itself. This was followed by an examination of the methods of research and the empirical study. The data generated indicated a significant difference in mean level of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> between the research groups in favour of the control group when controlling for age, gender and socio-economic status. This difference was highlighted by comparisons with existing research. No significant gender differences in <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> were found.

500|$|In the United States, {{following}} {{independence from}} Great Britain, the phrase was not commonly used.

500|$|The Zuo zhuan {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a masterpiece of early Chinese prose and [...] "grand historical narrative" [...] for many centuries.

[...] It enjoyed high status and esteem throughout the centuries of Chinese history because of its great literary quality, and was often read and memorized because of its role as the preeminent expansion and commentary on the Annals (Chunqiu), which almost all Chinese traditionally ascribed to Confucius.

500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E

The VetDIT discriminates between stages of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment,</b> condensed into three schemas: Personal Interest (PI), Maintaining Norms (MN), and Universal Principles (UP). There were no differences in the scores for MN and UP between the versions, and we equated PI scores to account for differences between versions.

40|$|Introduction. Alcoholism could {{represent}} {{an important factor}} of crime and different forms of abuse of family members (physical and emotional) exist in many alcohol-addict cases, as well as characteristics of immoral behaviour. Objective. The objective of our {{study was to determine}} the predominating forms in <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> of alcohol addicts, and to examine whether there was any statistically significant difference in <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> between alcohol addicted persons and non-alcoholics from general population. Methods. The sample consisted of 62 subjects, divided into a study (alcoholics) and a control group (non-alcoholics from general population). The following instruments were used: social-demographic data, AUDIT, MMPI- 201, cybernetic battery of IQ tests (KOG- 3) and the TMR moral reasoning test. Results. Mature forms of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> prevailed in both group of subjects, alcohol addicted persons and non-alcoholics. Regarding mature forms of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> (driven by emotions and cognitive) non-alcoholics from the general population had higher scores, but the difference was not statistically significant. Regarding socially adapted and egocentric orientation alcohol addicted persons had higher scores. However, only regarding intuitive-irrational orientation there was a statistically significant difference in the level of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> (p< 0. 05) between alcoholics and non-alcoholics, in favour of the alcoholics.
