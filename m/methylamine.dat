5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing <b>methylamine</b> hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous <b>methylamine,</b> or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

Sequential ion-molecule reactions leading to formation of multiple adducts were observed for each of the reactant mixtures investigated. Collision-induced dissociation was used to probe the adduct structures. There is evidence for hydrogen bonding between the amines and aluminum in most of the adducts studied. Rearrangement of the aluminum/nitrogen skeletons was not observed, although the aluminum/nitrogen bonds appear to be relatively strong, so that stable adducts can be formed.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using <b>methylamines</b> instead of ammonia as a nitrogen precursor for the CVD of nitrides is studied using quantum chemical computations of reaction energies: reaction electronic energy (Δ) reaction enthalpy (Δ) and reaction free energy (Δ). The reaction energies {{were calculated for}} three types of reactions: Uni- and bimolecular decomposition to more reactive nitrogen species, adduct forming with trimethylgallium (TMG) and trimethylaluminum (TMA) followed by a release of methane or ethane and surface adsorption to gallium nitride for both the unreacted ammonia or <b>methylamines</b> or the decomposition products. The calculations for the reaction entropy and free energy were made at both STP and CVD conditions (300 °C- 1300 °C and 50 mbar). The ab inito Gaussian 4 (G 4) theory {{were used for the}} calculations of the decomposition and adduct reactions while the surface adsorptions were calculated using the Density Functional Theory method B 3 LYP. From the reactions energies it can be concluded that the decomposition was facilitated by the increasing number of methyl groups on the nitrogen.

25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. <b>Methylamine</b> is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield. Ethanolamine is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous <b>methylamine,</b> their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or <b>methylamine</b> or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E
500|$|Effects of the solvent and {{solvation}} {{should be}} mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle {{than that of}} a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me3N > Me2NH > MeNH2 > NH3, is changed by water to [...] Me2NH > MeNH2 > Me3N > NH3. Neutral <b>methylamine</b> molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH2. Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Methylamines</b> are {{important}} chemicals in many industrial processes. They have use as intermediates {{for the production}} of many compounds containing amino groups as well as being used on their own. The acid catalysed amination of methanol generally yields a thermodynamically controlled product distribution. The equilibrium distribution for mono-, di-, and trimethylamine (MMA, DMA, and TMA), at 325 °C and a molar methanol to ammonia ratio of 1, is 17, 21, and 62 mol % respectively. The market demand, on the other hand, is for about 33, 53, and 14 mol % MMA, DMA and TMA. Industrially, <b>methylamines</b> are formed by the reaction of methanol or dimethyl ether and ammonia over amorphous silica-alumina. This process involves large separation and recycle units which are both costly and energy intensive as the separation requires azeotropic distillation at 15 bar. <b>Methylamines</b> can be formed over other solid acid catalysts with definite crystal structures, namely zeolites. While being more active than amorphous silica-alumina, most zeolites do not show improved selectivity. Catalysts, which have, however, been reported to show improved selectivity to DMA, include zeolites Rho, ZK- 5 and Chabazite. In addition, certain forms of hydrothermally treated Mordenite can produce nonequilibrium product distributions. The performance of Rho can also be improved with hydrothermal treatment. The objectives of this study were briefly as follows. Firstly, the question was asked as to which of the catalysts studied, viz. Rho and Mordenite, was the most suitable for the methanol amination reaction. The second objective was to find the optimal performance achievable from any catalyst using hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|Carried out in {{collaboration}} with Plymouth Marine LaboratoryA novel technique comprising solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography has been developed to analyse the three <b>methylamines</b> (monomethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine) at the concentrations expected in seawater. The volatility of the <b>methylamines</b> was exploited and allowed the headspace pre-concentration and gas chromatographic separation of the analytes. This method achieved limits of detection of 0. 43 nmol dm- 3, 2. 50 nmol dm- 3 and 0. 37 nmol dm- 3 for monomethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine, respectively, which are lower than any previously reported for seawater. This technique was applied to natural samples collected from the Western English Channel (WEC) and the <b>methylamines</b> were successfully quantified. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used to analyse glycine betaine in marine particulates. The volume filtered during sample collection {{was found to be}} critical in achieving accurate measurements of glycine betaine. Large filter volumes (1 L) significantly decreased observed concentrations compared to smaller volumes, and 10 mL was the optimised amount filtered. The difference in concentrations was attributed to large water volumes causing cell damage and loss of glycine betaine to the dissolved phase. Cell resilience was thought {{to play a role in}} the differences observed; for example, diatoms with their rigid silica cell walls were hypothesised to be more resilient to filtration stress. A seasonal study was carried out in the WEC using both 1 L and 10 mL samples and maximum glycine betaine concentrations were 50 nmol dm- 3 and 484 nmol dm- 3 in the 1 L and 10 mL samples, respectively. The latter concentrations were more than an order of magnitude higher than all previous measurements. Seasonality was observed and a significant correlation was found with chlorophyll a.
