40|$|Identifying the <b>decisive</b> <b>matches</b> in {{international}} football tournaments {{is of great}} relevance {{for a variety of}} decision makers such as organizers, team coaches and/or media managers. This paper addresses this issue by analyzing the role of the statistical approach used to estimate the outcome of the game on the identification of <b>decisive</b> <b>matches</b> on international tournaments for national football teams. We extend the measure of decisiveness proposed by Geenens (2014) in order to allow to predict or evaluate the <b>decisive</b> <b>matches</b> before, during and after a particular game on the tournament. Using information from the 2014 FIFA World Cup, our results suggest that Poisson and kernel regressions significantly outperform the forecasts of ordered probit models. Moreover, we find that although the identification of the <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> <b>matches</b> is independent of the model considered, the identification of other key matches is model dependent. We also apply this methodology to identify the favorite teams and to predict the <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> <b>matches</b> in 2015 Copa America {{before the start of the}} competition. Furthermore, we compare our forecast approach with respect to the original measure during the knockout stage...|$|R
