Two blind studies were performed using system configurations involving 1 -D, 2 -D, and 3 -D loudspeaker arrays. Various types of source material were used, ranging from urban soundscapes to musical passages. Experiment I consisted in collecting subjects’ perceptions in a free-response format to identify relevant criteria for <b>multi-dimensional</b> spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> of complex auditory scenes {{by means of}} linguistic analysis. Experiment II utilized both free response and scale judgments for seven parameters derived form Experiment I. Results indicated {{a strong correlation between}} the source material ~sound scene! and the subjective evaluation of the parameters, making the notion of an ‘‘optimal’’ reproduction method difficult for arbitrary source material...|$|R

Multi-channel <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} methods to realize a <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> system robustly against a head movement. Multi-channel <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> can reproduce the same acoustic field as the recording area by using several controlled points. However, such <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> systems have not been developed due to poor understanding of the behavior of multiple channel systems. In this paper, we first investigate the accuracy of the reproduced sound of a multi-channel <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> system. In particular we investigate the optimal loudspeaker arrangement and the optimal number of controlled points using computer simulation. We also construct a multi-channel <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> system which can reproduce the sound within the wide reproduced area around the listener's head. As a result, good sound localization is realized by arranging loudspeakers around the controlled field...|$|R

In the particular context at hand, a certain aspect of the materiality of language, the qualities of vocalization, helps to minimize the gap between authoritative source and present performance.

The interior of a car is a quite complex acoustical environment, making high quality <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> a challenging task. Due to the architecture of a car loudspeaker placement and alignment is limited and far from optimal in terms of WFS reproduction. The knowledge about the temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics of the sound propagation in the enclosure allows one to optimize the reproduction quality. In order to evaluate the sound field characteristics, high spatial resolution measurements using a planar microphone array have been conducted.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for spatially accurate high-quality <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> in automotive audio. Although cars are typically multi-listener environments, existing solutions are commonly limited to a sweet spot or {{a small number of}} positions. Wave field synthesis (WFS) is a spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> technique that enables superior spatial accuracy over an extended listening area, but requires a large number of loudspeakers and has a very high computational complexity. Integrating a WFS system into a car is therefore a challenging task. This paper describes an implementation of a real-Time WFS system that is fully integrated into the interior of a ridable concept car. This prototype is used to investigate the possibilities of WFS for in-car environments. The sound system is combined with a sophisticated room simulation to enable real-To-life auralization.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{research on}} spatial sound perception {{in the context}} of multichannel and other spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> systems. Issues associated with multichannel level alignment are discussed. Additionally aspects relating to the quality of spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> associated with loudspeaker directivity and 3 D sound algorithms are considered. Lastly, a study of spatial sound perception is unfolded. This thesis contributes to the understanding of level alignment techniques from both a subjective and objective standpoint in multichannel <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> schemes. The aim of these subjective experiments was to obtain a database of subject responses for a level alignment task under a wide range of normal usage situations, accounting for different source locations, distances, directivities, sensitivities, bandwidths and absolute reproduction levels. The data was analysed and correlated with a set of objective metrics measured for each test condition. From this analysis it is possible to ascertain superior test signal/metric combinations for perceptually motivated level alignment. Results may be directly applied to automated level calibration systems. Tools for binaural real-time loudness measurement are introduced allowing for the assessment of directional loudness characteristics and multiple source loudness alignment within arbitrary reveberation spaces. The second set of experiments focuses on issues influencing the quality of spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> under different multichannel <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> scenarios. Firstly, the influence of loudspeaker directivity is subjectively assessed in a discrete five channel multichannel scenario. A set of experiments are presented that assess the influence of directivity both in the frontal and surround loudspeakers under idealised listening conditions. A range of virtual home theater systems are reviewed and a benchmark experiment is presented that compares their performance with respect to a discrete five channel multichannel reproduction. Evaluations are performed in an idealised "standard listening room" and real room conditions. Relative performances of each system are discussed in terms of relative spatial and timbral degradation. Lastly, initial studies are presented into the multidimensional perceptual unfolding of spatially processed speech reproduced over headphones. This study provides the basis for further studies in this area in an attempt to unravel or "unfold" the perceptual dimensions associated with spatial <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction.</b> reviewe...|$|R
