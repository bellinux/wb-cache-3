5|$|Meanwhile, <b>Microsoft</b> began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. <b>Microsoft</b> Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} word processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. <b>Microsoft</b> Works would later be sold with other <b>Microsoft</b> products including <b>Microsoft</b> Word and <b>Microsoft</b> Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, <b>Microsoft</b> introduced its most successful office product, <b>Microsoft</b> Office. Unlike the model of <b>Microsoft</b> Works, <b>Microsoft</b> Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as <b>Microsoft</b> Word, <b>Microsoft</b> Excel and so forth. While <b>Microsoft</b> Word and <b>Microsoft</b> Office were mostly developed internally, <b>Microsoft</b> also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as <b>Microsoft</b> SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>Microsoft</b> sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by <b>Microsoft.</b> In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with <b>Microsoft</b> to get one introduced, although <b>Microsoft</b> developer Niels Ferguson and other <b>Microsoft</b> spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. <b>Microsoft</b> engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; <b>Microsoft</b> engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by <b>Microsoft</b> partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Windows Phone, <b>Microsoft</b> {{underwent}} a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012—the corporation's logos, products, services and websites adopted the principles and concepts of the Metro design language. <b>Microsoft</b> previewed Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011. A developer preview was released on September 13, {{and was replaced by}} a consumer preview on February 29, 2012. On May 31, 2012, the preview version was released. On June 18, 2012, <b>Microsoft</b> unveiled the Surface, the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by <b>Microsoft.</b> On June 25, <b>Microsoft</b> paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer. On July 31, 2012, <b>Microsoft</b> launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail. On September 4, 2012, <b>Microsoft</b> released Windows Server 2012.|$|E

5000|$|As to {{the fact}} that <b>Microsoft's</b> [...] "undercover investigator" [...] traced some of the {{products}} sold by Harmony to two of <b>Microsoft's</b> licensees, the defendants still violated <b>Microsoft's</b> license agreement, which required that licensees [...] "shall distribute Product(s) only with licensee's Customer System(s)". (The [...] "Customer System" [...] here means a [...] "single user computer system".) Harmony's selling the product stand-alone breached <b>Microsoft's</b> license agreement.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, <b>Microsoft</b> {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying <b>Microsoft</b> a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that <b>Microsoft</b> write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. <b>Microsoft</b> wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. <b>Microsoft</b> Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When <b>Microsoft</b> launched several versions of <b>Microsoft</b> Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Microsoft</b> {{announced}} in May 2016 {{that the free}} upgrade offer would be extended to users of assistive technologies; however, <b>Microsoft</b> did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer, which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a free Windows 10 upgrade. <b>Microsoft</b> said that the loophole {{is not intended to}} be used in this manner. In November 2017, <b>Microsoft</b> stated that this program would end December 31, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Sixteen {{months after}} the release of version 2.0, <b>Microsoft</b> skipped version 3.0 and {{released}} <b>Microsoft</b> Security Essentials 4.0.

5000|$|<b>Microsoft's</b> {{computer}} network was compromised repeatedly by the Xbox Underground between 2011 and 2013. According to a 65-page indictment, the hackers spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] searching through <b>Microsoft's</b> network copying log-in credentials, source code, technical specifications and other data. This {{culminated in the}} perpetrators carrying out a physical theft, by using stolen credentials to enter [...] "a secure building" [...] at <b>Microsoft's</b> Redmond headquarters and exiting with Xbox development kits. Group members say they were driven by a strong curiosity about <b>Microsoft's</b> then-unreleased Xbox One console and associated software.|$|R
5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version of Windows that <b>Microsoft</b> will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that <b>Microsoft</b> {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that <b>Microsoft</b> was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
