6000|$|... "Your attentiveness and {{consideration}} <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> sensible {{of my own}} neglect. Fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> {{suspicious}} than ever," [...] answered Dick. [...] "Boys, Dan Baxter {{may have}} been acting on the square after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, dear, please don't be miserable," [...] said Gwendolen, with pettish remonstrance. [...] "It only <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> so. I am {{in doubt}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay a moment, Alexandrina," [...] he said; [...] "I am not happy, and {{you should}} not say words {{intended}} to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As if I could!' said Aubrey, impatiently, 'when it only <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> mad to {{see what}} a fellow they have shut up in here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Endymion, [...] "you {{have all}} been most kind to <b>me,</b> and that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> wretched at the {{prospect}} of leaving you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If there's {{one thing}} <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> angry than another," [...] said Mrs. Korner, [...] "it is being told I {{say things that}} I do not mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it is I who have {{offended}} you," [...] she said. [...] "Don't {{be angry with}} <b>me,</b> Amelius! don't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> unhappy than I am!" ...|$|R
50|$|On {{leaving the}} army, this course and its artwork steered John to art school in Middlesbrough’s Constantine College. In five years he passed Intermediate Arts and Crafts and gained National Diplomas in Design in both {{painting}} and illustration - making <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> {{than any of}} the staff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} say that your {{complying}} with me in this my intended [...] Mercy, shall <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> willing, but certainly 'twill <b>make</b> <b>me</b> [...] <b>more</b> cheerful in granting your just Grievances: But if no less [...] than his Life can satisfie my People, I must say Let justice be [...] done. Thus again recommending the consideration of my Intention [...] to you, I rest, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> {{and more}} afraid. It {{is all too}} wretched to lead any one into. Since I knew the whole truth, I have tried to spare you from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{pretended to}} do it, and you even pretended {{reluctance}} to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> willing to trust you. Then {{you began to}} use your ingenuity {{to get him out}} of the way." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly not. Any such {{investigation}} {{could only}} increase the disgust {{with which he}} inspires <b>me,</b> and <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> determined than ever not to know him on any terms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she did; {{she told}} me that she could read all sorts of things in my face, and offered, if I would give myself up to it, to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> than human." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{see that}} that’s exactly your business, {{but if it}} will <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> seductive I’ll confess that I’m quite by myself. I had to come alone or not come at all.” ...|$|R
3000|$|... ……. It’s {{just trying}} to take the {{necessary}} command and control over my own process of learning as much as possible. Sense of independence and command would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> confident on my improvement.|$|R
6000|$|... "For your age, Isobel," [...] I {{declared}} seriously, [...] "you {{are very}} nearly a practical person. You <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> than ever anxious {{for an answer}} to my last question. What were you thinking of just now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For her age and station {{she must}} have been a person of means, for having tried in vain various methods to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> {{acceptable}} to followers and such as having passed would turn their heads, she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why so?" [...] I asked, amazed, {{yet somehow}} {{feeling in my}} heart I could trust him implicitly. [...] "Why should the {{knowledge}} of the true circumstances of the case <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> unhappy than I am at present?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mechanically obedient, I {{rose and}} went. I knew what I was about; my mind had run over the intent with lightning-speed. To take this step could not <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> wretched than I was; it might soothe me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will. It's {{because it}} <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy--it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> than happy--to be with you. It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> {{comfortable}}. You know how selfish men are? If a man feels comfortable {{all over with}} certain people, he'll bore them to death, just like a dog. You always <b>make</b> <b>me</b> feel as if pleasant {{things were going to}} happen to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} set of lights that <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> cheerful," [...] he said, [...] "and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town. Please God we may be there in ten minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but, my dear," [...] says I, [...] "you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> uneasy {{now than}} before; for if you {{apprehend}} no danger, {{why do you}} use this caution? and if you apprehend there is danger, why do you go at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Thenceforward he {{doubled the}} pains {{he had been}} at to {{instruct}} me: he brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility; “because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good humour, and <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> diverting.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing; but I can commiserate you. I {{should be}} worse than unfeeling if I didn't, {{although}} my own affliction is of so sad and solemn a kind. Indeed my own loss <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> keenly alive to yours, different in nature as it is.' ...|$|R
30|$|Five {{items of}} {{perceived}} tanning attractiveness were {{measured on a}} 5 -point rating scale (1 [*]=[*]strongly disagree, 5 [*]=[*]strongly agree) developed by Cafri et al. (2006).

5000|$|At {{the opening}} of the {{following}} essay, the mistake of calling Joseph II the emperor Franz Joseph is so egregious that I have let it stand in the text {{in the hope that the}} public humiliation will <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> careful in the future. Several readers wrote to signal other mistakes ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was indeed, Annie. I {{think the}} only thing I could do well was fighting. I was a beggar to fight--not because I used to quarrel with fellows, but because it made me hard and tough, and my mother {{thought that it would}} <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> fit to carry out this search for my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you won't," [...] I replied, quietly, for my pain {{had served}} to soothe my {{excitement}} {{as well as}} to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> determined. [...] "We'll tie up the darned tiger, if he cuts us all to pieces. You know how Jones will give us the laugh if we fail. Here, bind up my wrist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> {{think well}} of myself to bring such a smile into your face! But, Septimius, {{what is this}} little hillock here so close to our path? Have you heaped it up here for a seat? Shall we sit down upon it for an instant?--for it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> tired to walk {{backward}} and forward on one path than to go straight forward a much longer distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|COMTESSE. You but <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> curious, and {{my doctor}} says that I must be told everything.

6000|$|... 'I will pray God to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> desirous {{and more}} able to follow the holy example you leave behind. Oh that the peace of God may be given to me also when I come to die; though how may I dare to hope for such an end, so full of faith and love and the patient waiting for Christ! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{concern for}} you, Mabel, may <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> cowardly than common; but, to be frank, I see but one method {{of keeping the}} cutter from being wrecked {{in the course of}} the next two or three hours, and that your uncle refuses to take. After all, this may be my ignorance; for, as he says, Ontario is merely fresh water." ...|$|R
