5|$|More than 30 actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, and Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar on the same day. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the colorful Sheik Ilderim. The role of Jesus was played by Claude Heater (uncredited), an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film.|$|E
5|$|Robinson married Marjorie Joseph in 1938; the {{marriage}} was annulled the same year. Their son, Ronnie Smith, was born in 1939. Robinson met his second wife Edna Mae Holly, a noted dancer who performed at the Cotton Club and toured Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, in 1940. According to Robinson, he <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> a local pool he frequented after his boxing workouts. In {{an attempt to get}} her attention he pushed her into the pool one day, and claimed it was an accident. After this attempt was met with disdain, he appeared at the nightclub she danced at and introduced himself. Soon the couple were dating and they married in 1943. They had one son, Ray Robinson Jr. (born 1949) and divorced in 1960. She appeared on the first cover of Jet magazine in 1951. In April 1959 Robinson's eldest sister, Marie, died of cancer at the age of 41.|$|E
5|$|Grove took {{advantage}} of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost {{as the result of}} a balk. At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat. Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.|$|E

25|$|This was in {{the summer}} of 1955 and Osborne spent much of the next two years before their divorce hoping they would reconcile. In 1956, after Look Back in Anger had opened, Osborne <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the railway station in York, at which meeting she told Osborne of her recent {{abortion}} and enquired after his relationship with Mary Ure, of which she was aware.

25|$|In 1932 {{he went to}} {{work for}} the Hoover Air League as co-director of the Aviation Division. He married Gretchen Frances Hahnen (1902–1986) in New York City on June 2, 1934 at the New York Municipal Building in Manhattan. Gretchen was the {{daughter}} of Zora Montgomery Courtney (1882–1962) and was originally from Peoria, Illinois. Her father was Herman F. Hahnen from Des Moines, Iowa. She was a member the Jersey City Young Woman's Christian Association (YWCA) and was director of the Aviation Club of The Jersey Journal, and the editor of the Junior Club Magazine. Eddie <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> an aviation function. They did not have any children.|$|E
25|$|Wyler {{typically}} {{cast the}} Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore {{the divide between}} the two groups. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired {{after two days of}} work because she could not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott (who had played the mother of Heston's Moses in The Ten Commandments, and with whom he'd worked on Broadway) as Miriam. Scott was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline (Ben-Hur would be her last screen performance) Wyler cast her as Tirzah. More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, primarily because he had become famous for his roles as a wise old patriarch in a number of films. Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar the same day as Jaffe. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Wyler's efforts at persuasion were successful, and Hawkins was cast on March 18, 1958. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the comical Sheik Ilderim. Finlay Currie had worked with Zimbalist before on Quo Vadis, playing St. Peter, was cast as Balthasar.|$|E

500|$|In mid-August, when Bryant {{returned}} from France, Reed <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> {{the dock and}} told her to prepare to go to Petrograd four days later to cover the Russian Revolution. Eastman of The Masses had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant to report on the war [...] "from a woman's point of view". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian czar, Nicholas II. Headed by Alexander Kerensky, the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted putsch by Major General Lavr Kornilov. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the Kornilov Affair and before the Bolsheviks overthrew the Kerensky government in the October Revolution.|$|E
500|$|Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira {{recorded}} a cover version of [...] "Islands" [...] {{for inclusion in}} her ninth studio album Sale el Sol, which was released on October 19, 2010. Although there was initial speculation that the cover would be entitled [...] "Explore", it appeared on the final track list of the album using its original name. In comparison to the original version, Shakira's cover of [...] "Islands" [...] follows a largely similar and [...] "fairly faithful" [...] instrumentation, but features a faster tempo, [...] "hopeful-sounding" [...] vocals, and [...] "pseudo-house" [...] elements. Prior to Shakira recording the cover of [...] "Islands", Croft had briefly <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the London BBC Studios; the former talked about her meeting, saying [...] "We were sitting on a wall outside the BBC and she came up and her bodyguards parted and it was little Shakira, and she says, [...] "Hi!" [...] And I was like, Wow! I found out recently that she’s {{a big fan of}} The Cure and stuff".|$|E
500|$|Strindberg was {{susceptible}} to strong, independent career women, {{as well as}} to dainty, delicate-looking young girls; like his first and second wives—Siri von Essen and Frida Uhl—Bosse combined these qualities. He was entranced when he saw the dark, exotic-looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was often cast in sprite roles or what were conceptualized as [...] "Oriental" [...] roles) play her first major part, an impish Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play To Damascus, and invited [...] her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role. At this famous first meeting, Strindberg, according to Bosse's narrative of the event, <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the door all smiles and charm. Offering her wine, flowers, and beautifully arranged fruit, he shared with her his fascination with alchemy, showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made. When she got up to leave, Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays. [...] Bosse gave it to him, and he used this feather, with a steel nib insert, to write all his dramas during their marriage. [...] It is now in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm.|$|E

2500|$|Macdowell was 25 when Eakins <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the Hazeltine Gallery where The Gross Clinic {{was being}} {{exhibited}} in 1875. [...] Unlike many, she {{was impressed by}} the controversial painting and she decided to study with him at the Academy, which she attended for six years, adopting a sober, realistic style similar to her teacher's. Macdowell was an outstanding student and winner of the Mary Smith Prize for the best painting by a matriculating woman artist.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this eclectic early career, she widened her circle of friends and {{contacts}} beyond those in society and politics with whom she already had close connections. As one of Anthony Eden's biographers put it, she was [...] "equally at home in the worlds of Hatfield and Fitzrovia", while a reviewer of her memoir wrote that [...] "few lives can have touched so many social worlds, or graced them so elegantly". Even so, Lady Avon did not impress everyone: after the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> a Conservative Party ball in 1954, she wrote dismissively to her sister, [...] "Mrs Anthony Eden received us. Really she is a most colourless personality".|$|E

2500|$|Ruskin's later {{relationship}} with Rose La Touche {{has led to}} claims {{that he was a}} paedophile, on the grounds that he stated that {{he fell in love with}} her when he <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the age of nine. In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time. It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to Kate Greenaway he asked her to draw her [...] "girlies" [...] (as he called her child figures) without clothing: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Audre Lorde {{started a}} visiting {{professorship}} in West Berlin at the Free University of Berlin. She was invited by FU lecturer Dagmar Schultz who <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the UN [...] "World Women's Conference" [...] in Copenhagen in 1980. While Lorde was in Germany {{she made a}} significant impact on the women there and was a big part of the start of the Afro-German movement. The term Afro-German was created by Lorde and some Black German women as a nod to African-American. During her many trips to Germany, Lorde touched many women's lives including May Ayim, Ika Hügel-Marshall, and Hegal Emde. All of these women decided to start writing after they met Audre Lorde. Instead of fighting systemic issues through violence, Lorde thought that language was a powerful form of resistance and encouraged the women of Germany to speak up instead of fight back. Her impact on Germany reached more than just Afro-German women. Many white women and men found Lorde's work to be very beneficial to their own lives, too. They started to put their privilege and power into question and became more conscious of intersectional lives.|$|E
