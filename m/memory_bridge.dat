These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, <b>Memory,</b> <b>Bridge</b> Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

They have investigated how to store more than one bit per cell or so-called MLC (multi-level cell) PCM. They have successfully tackled the problem of long-term resistance drift in MLC PCM by using novel read-out metrics. Furthermore, using a new device concept in which the physical mechanism of writing is decoupled from the read process, they were able to eliminate drift; they call this new concept “projected PCM devices”.|$|R
50|$|Brynntrup’s works {{deliberately}} {{bypass the}} art market when they (e.g. in tabu2000.net) ironically comment on the art world’s “operating system”, subverting it by creating a direct channel to the audience, without gallery mediation. Many of his works present explicitly autobiographical, almost private details, turning the audience into confidants and collaborationists (e.g. in Loverfilm - An Uncontrolled Dispersion Of Information). In many cases, the audience is directly addressed by the screen: “Dear Audience. You will now see...” (e.g. in The Statics - Engineering <b>Memory</b> <b>Bridges).</b> In many of his works, the screening space and the public’s physical reactions are yet another topical focus (e.g. in ACHTUNG - die Achtung). This aspect becomes even more intensified with his walk-in video installations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{design for the}} parallel processing of synthetic aperture radar data using one or more Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Our design supports real-time computation of a two-dimensional image from a matrix of echo pulses and their corresponding response values. Components of this design include: (a) central processing pipeline to perform back projection calculations, (b) pre-fetch cache to minimize external memory access latency, (c) <b>memory</b> <b>bridge</b> {{that serves as the}} primary on-chip storage for pulse data, and (d) a pixel queue to direct image data {{in and out of the}} pipeline. Design parameters may be adjusted to achieve optimum performance, and multiple instances of this design may be replicated on-chip to achieve prespecified performance objectives. We provide a complexity analysis as a function of the input and output parameters. Simulation results based on an implementation of this design show that our design achieves 160 GOPs per instance on a simulated Altera Stratix III EP 3 SL 150 FPGA, and scales well for output image size ranging from 500 x 500 pixels to 5, 000 x 5, 000 pixels...|$|E

Previous research in this area had produced inconclusive results (e. g., Colle, 1980). The current study demonstrated a novel finding, that sound presented to the left ear produces the greatest level of disruption. These results were explained in terms of hemispheric specialisation for processing of some supra-linguistic components in the unattended sound. Results also supported previous research by demonstrating that both forms of irrelevant sound disrupted performance on serial <b>memory</b> tasks (<b>Bridges</b> & Jones, 1996; Colle & Welsh, 1976; Jones, Alford, Bridges, Tremblay, & Macken, 1999; Jones, Miles, & Page, 1990) ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a Reduced Instruction Set Computer. Its instruction memory utilizes a unique cache architecture and a two-stage memory pipelining technique. Because of the bandwidth of the 64 -bit instruction bus, instruction prefetching is possible and is implemented. The data <b>memory</b> is <b>bridged</b> by a four-way set-associative cache which uses a mix of write-through and copy-back memory write-back policies. A four-stage execution pipeline is used to accelerate instruction execution. Scoreboard bits are implemented for the general register set. The use of the scoreboard reduces data dependency problems. The cache architecture is specifically designed to handle programs including branch instructions. Simulation results show that the CPU executes cold-start simulated programs in nearly half the time of that of other RISC microprocessors...|$|R

40|$|Bridging fault {{extraction}} {{and analysis}} {{are crucial to}} deriving high quality bridging fault test generation. As state-of-the-art designs integrate millions of logic gates into a VLSI circuit, a run-time and <b>memory</b> efficient <b>bridging</b> fault extraction approach must be developed {{to cope with the}} design complexity. In this paper, a hierarchical bridging fault analyzer - FAULTAN is described. In FAULTAN, the design hierarchy is followed while performing fault extraction resulting in both computation time and memory savings compared to the traditional flat approach. As part of the hierarchical extraction strategy, a cell fault library is built a priori to help accelerate the bridging fault extraction process. Through the fully hierarchical extraction techniques, FAULTAN achieves on the average 5 times speedup and 1 / 10 memory usage as compared with an existing flat fault extractor. The superior accuracy of FAULTAN is also demonstrated in this paper. 1 Introduction As state-of-the-art designs [...] ...|$|R
