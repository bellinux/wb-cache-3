5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his <b>Marines</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of the fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{generally}} dismiss {{these numbers}} as exaggerations. One approach {{to estimate the}} number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra <b>marines,</b> <b>in</b> addition to a probable 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, the consensus is around 25,000.|$|E

The British had captured the island of Marie Galante earlier that year, but the French governor of Guadeloupe attacked the island on hearing that illness had weakened its British garrison. Marie Galante slaves assisted the British when promised {{that they would not}} be returned to their proprietors; by this means, the island was preserved under British control until the arrival of three companies of the 1st West India Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{strongly}} {{approved of}} the book and several thousand copies of it were bought by the War Ministry and Naval Ministry who by the beginning of 1934 were distributing the books for free to foreign journalists and officials. By contrast, the Nationalist Government of China responded by banning Townsend's book throughout China from 1935. Even so, the journalist George Moorad reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed contraband copies of the book to American China <b>Marines</b> <b>in</b> the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{portion of}} the {{operation}} was to bear the title Dewey Canyon II, named for Operation Dewey Canyon conducted by U.S. <b>Marines</b> <b>in</b> the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title Lam Son 719, after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot Lê Lợi, who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{funerals}} {{were held}} in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr. Their older brother, serving with the Royal <b>Marines</b> <b>in</b> Singapore, was flown home for the service. That day, 20,000 people attended rallies in Belfast and Carrickfergus. In Belfast, the cenotaph at the City Hall {{was the focus of}} the mourning with 10,000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre. Many wept openly. The Reverend Ian Paisley led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths. The crowd observed a two-minute silence and sang a hymn and the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 <b>marines.</b> <b>In</b> the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, {{and this was}} probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes {{seem to have been}} easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet.|$|E
