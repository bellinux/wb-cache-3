5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; <b>matt</b> <b>black</b> was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E

25|$|K 190: Owned by VicTrack and {{operated}} by Steamrail Victoria, and as of September 2017 it is operating on the Victorian Goldfields Railway in Maldon. It is regularly used on suburban shuttles and on day tours to Geelong and similar-length trips. When first restored in 1977 at Bayswater and Newport, the engine was painted in a two-tone green livery; this lasted until 1992, after which the engine was returned to a plain black livery. In 1995, she was leased to the South Gippsland railway, and that organisation gave a simpler version of the green livery, using apple green on the boiler, cab, tender and cylinders (with limited dark green lining), red buffer beams both ends, and <b>matt</b> <b>black</b> frames and wheels. By 4th Nov 2000 the engine had returned to Steamrail in Melbourne, and been repainted gloss black; by Easter of 2001 the front buffer beam had been repainted red. The engine spent some time around 2010 on the Maldon railway. On Saturday 12 March 2016, the engine was restored to service in a new crimson with yellow, black and red livery, {{along the same lines}} as the R 766's previous livery. Both were inspired by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway's crimson lake livery.|$|E
500|$|No.822 was {{completed}} before Grouping, and initially {{ran in the}} SECR's unlined dark grey livery with white lettering and numbering. It was repainted {{at the same time}} as the resetting of the boiler pressure in June 1925, in a dark olive green livery. [...] The green was complemented with plain white lining, black borders and primrose yellow markings. This livery was also applied to the five locomotives built in 1930. During the Second World War, when labour and paint were in short supply, the class was gradually repainted in <b>matt</b> <b>black.</b> The repainting took place during essential maintenance visits to Ashford works, and included the application of Bulleid's [...] "Sunshine" [...] yellow block lettering and numerals on both tender and cabside. This livery was gradually replaced with gloss black between 1945 and 1947.|$|E
500|$|In November 2002 {{several former}} members {{arranged}} Your Country Needs You, a concert of [...] "voices {{in opposition to}} war", as the Crass Collective. At Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank, Your Country Needs You included Benjamin Britten's War Requiem and performances by Goldblade, Fun-Da-Mental, Ian MacKaye and Pete Wright's post-Crass project, Judas 2. In October 2003 the Crass Collective changed their name to Crass Agenda, with Rimbaud, Libertine and Vaucher working with <b>Matt</b> <b>Black</b> of Coldcut and jazz musicians such as Julian Siegel and Kate Shortt. In 2004 Crass Agenda spearheaded a campaign to save the Vortex Jazz Club in Stoke Newington, north London (where they regularly played). In June 2005 Crass Agenda was declared to be [...] "no more", changing {{its name to the}} [...] "more pertinent" [...] Last Amendment. After a five-year hiatus, Last Amendment performed at the Vortex in June 2012. Rimbaud has also performed and recorded with Japanther and the Charlatans.

Matt discovers that drinking alcohol appears to injure Sylar, and quickly downs several glasses. Sylar finally appears to disappear, and <b>Matt</b> <b>blacks</b> out right as Janice returns with Matt's partner from the force. Matt awakens hours later, and talks with his wife and partner, vowing to never let this happen to him again. However, it is revealed that Sylar took control of Matt's body while he was blacked out, and now is controlling him completely.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2009, Bellamy {{mentioned}} the {{extensive use of}} Dickinson amplifiers on the album The Resistance. Bellamy owns many Manson guitars, built by Hugh Manson, excluding the Mirror Kaoss, Doubleneck, Keytar and <b>Matt</b> <b>Black</b> II which were built by Tim Stark. All of the guitars built for Bellamy, aside from the 7 String E Guitar, have a shape that he designed with Manson, dubbed [...] "Mattocaster". The Mattocaster shape resulted from Bellamy wanting a guitar with [...] "the body of a Fender Telecaster {{and the sound of}} a Gibson Les Paul". Bellamy is also famed for his use of the Zvex Fuzz Factory, which he uses to achieve his signature feedback squeals, most famously heard on the introduction of [...] "Plug in Baby". He has said that the core of his tone is a Vox AC30.|$|E
2500|$|Stalwart of the fleet, rarely out of service, {{the second}} of the 1905 {{locomotives}} was named after another company director and is fondly remembered by several generations of enthusiasts as the longest-serving fleet member. [...] Having been re-boilered in 1959 this ensured her future well into the final years of company operation, through the Marquess of Ailsa years and into nationalisation. [...] Another boiler was fitted in 1981 (the first under government ownership) when she was re-painted into the current Indian red having previously sported a variation of the spring green livery. [...] The boiler tubes for this new boiler were funded by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association, a local preservation group. [...] In 1989 she was chosen to take part in The Ginger Tree, a television dramatisation being filmed on the railway and was painted into an un-lined <b>matt</b> <b>black</b> livery which she retained for the rest of that season before being returned to a variation on the Indian red livery. [...] In 2007 she was again withdrawn, and has not seen service but is expected to be returned to active service {{at some point in the}} future. [...] The locomotive sports a brass safety valve bonnet mounted on the boiler (the others being painted) but this was originally carried by No. 13 Kissack until 1971. [...] The locomotive last worked in 2007 and awaits the return of a rebuilt boiler from the Severn Valley Railway.It featured in the movie Five Children & It.|$|E

50|$|As {{the imprint}} grew, Ninja grew into an ‘anti-corporate’ brand, {{supporting}} {{the work of}} visual artists, filmmakers, and mavericks of all media, running its own club nights and helping disseminate the work of its artists across the globe. From its very beginnings, Ninja Tune sought a strong visual identity, thanks to Michael Bartalos (whose original logo was a monochrome woodcut of a hooded ninja brandishing his long sword) and Mark Porter, <b>Matt</b> <b>Black's</b> friend from Oxford, Ninja's first art director who defined the logo and overall aesthetic (in addition to creating Ninja's striking yellow and black in-house record bags), and subsequently became Art Director at The Guardian. It was the arrival of Kevin Foakes as in-house designer in 1994 that developed the logo to its current international recognition, and became largely responsible {{for some of the}} label's most iconic artwork. Working as Openmind, Foakes has designed many of Ninja's album sleeves, including memorable covers for Amon Tobin, Coldcut and Funki Porcini's 2002 album Fast Asleep. He's also commissioned acclaimed outside talent for a number of key projects.|$|R
