30|$|As a mixed salt, <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> {{generally}} {{contains only}} about 10  % lead molybdate [18]. Because the tinting strength of <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> is strong, {{the proportion of}} this colorant added to the paint {{also appears to be}} low, hence the weak intensity of the Mo peak when the pigment is admixed with another lead containing pigment. Additionally, this low concentration of <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> obscures the distinctive Raman signature of this colorant (vide infra) when {{in the presence of the}} strongly scattering chrome yellow, therefore it was not observed in the Raman analysis for this passage of paint.|$|E

All of the Raman spectra taken from the seals also include a series of weak bands in the region of 1000 – 1600  cm− 1. <b>Molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> is often blended with synthetic organic pigments to produce a red shade [18], particularly toluidine red (PR 3) [11], but in this case, the spectral match with PR 3 is poor.

30|$|<b>Molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> {{has been}} a common {{industrial}} pigment since its commercialization in 1934 – 35 [11], but to date no published identifications of PR 104 {{have appeared in the}} conservation literature. A seemingly related pigment identified as cadmium orange molybdate was, however, reported to be among the colors used by Willem de Kooning in his 1965 work Woman, albeit mixed with a variety of other pigments in two areas described as dark green and pink [17]. This particular pigment is unknown to the present authors and is not listed in common pigment references. Among unpublished sources, <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> was previously detected in the IMA’s 1967 Donald Judd sculpture Untitled (IMA# 1992.362), and a poster presented at the 2015 American Institute for Conservation’s annual meeting in Miami reported its use in admixture with lead chromate yellow in Robert Murray’s Duet owned by California State University, Long Beach.|$|E
30|$|An {{in-depth}} investigation of Maki’s pigment choices using non-invasive light-based technologies like Raman microspectroscopy facilitated by in situ XRF analysis has identified an extensive palette of luminous pigments. This unprecedented study of his material choices suggests {{the use of}} commercial paints that while similar in color, varied in composition over the years. Of particular note in these colorants are the occurrences of aniline black and <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange,</b> which have not been positively identified previously in fine art prints.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, the Raman {{features}} of the orange paint matched that of the yellow paint, attributing the primary pigment to chrome yellow in its predominantly monoclinic phase [26]. Considering that both the orange and yellow paints were applied {{at the same time}} and aged together in the same environment over the same period, it is surprising that the orange paint darkens much faster than the yellow paint. Since the orange paint has an additional component of <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange,</b> it would be interesting in the future to consider the role that this pigment mixture plays in the rate of the color change reaction.|$|E
30|$|Pigment {{reference}} samples were acquired {{in order to}} confirm spectral characterizations and to construct model samples of paint mixtures. Aniline black (Paliotol L 0080, PBk 1) was acquired from BASF, chrome yellow medium (PY 34) and toluidine red (PR 3) from Kremer Pigments, and <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> (PR 104) from Rublev. A reference for lamp black (PBk 7) was acquired {{in the form of}} a commercial Winsor & Newton watercolor tube paint. Model paints were prepared by mulling the pure pigment or pigment mixtures with Kremer gum arabic prepared as a thick watercolour paste according to an artist’s recipe [5] and spread to dry on white paper or glass slides.|$|E
30|$|The vibrancy of the {{contrasting}} {{colors in the}} Haku Maki prints {{and the potential for}} lengthy or repeated exhibition raised concerns over the stability of the inks to light. Chrome based pigments are known to darken upon exposure to light, and the lightfastness of aniline black is variously reported as either good or questionable. Herbst and Hunger’s authoritative industrial textbook describes the lightfastness of aniline black as good in the masstone, but weaker when admixed with titanium white [12]. However, several artists’ websites and watercolor manuals list the pigment in commercial paints as being of only moderate lightfastness or fugitive unless mixed with carbon black [19, 20]. <b>Molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> in particular is considered to have only modest lightfastness [18 – 20].|$|E
30|$|The {{observance}} of these pigments has {{also led to}} {{a study of the}} lightfastness of Maki’s palette using visible light induced accelerated fade testing of an exemplar of his “Poem” series. This lightfastness study identified several inorganic pigments like chrome yellow and <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> that are susceptible to loss of intensity and darkening upon exposure to light and demonstrated somewhat surprisingly the lightfastness of the somewhat fugitive aniline black when mixed with a carbonaceous black pigment. These studies highlight the importance of light in the appreciation of these vibrant modern woodblock prints, the utility of light-based analyses in understanding the artist’s material choices, the role of light in the degradation of these same artworks, and the importance of identifying artist’s materials for customizing stewardship practices.|$|E
30|$|Four {{brightly colored}} calligraphic prints from the “Poem” series (1970 / 71) by Japanese artist Haku Maki (1924 – 2000) were {{examined}} using multiple light-based analytical techniques {{in an effort}} to address conservation concerns regarding these artworks. A distracting white haze on the surface of some of the prints was determined by light microscopy and infrared microanalysis to be fungal mycelium from an inactive mold infestation that occurred prior to the artwork’s acquisition by the museum. Pigment analysis by Raman, X-ray fluorescence, and infrared microspectroscopies identified the artist’s palette as containing common printing ink colors such as aniline black (PBk 1), carbon black (PBk 7), phthalocyanine blue (PB 15), Prussian blue (PB 27), ultramarine blue (PB 29), <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> (PR 104), chrome yellow (PY 34), barium yellow (PY 31), viridian (PG 17), barium sulphate (PW 21), and synthetic organic red pigments (PR 3, PR 22, PR 48 : 3). Although aniline black and <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange</b> are common industrial pigments, reference vibrational spectra to assist in their identification have not appeared previously in the conservation literature. Moreover, this investigation includes to the authors’ knowledge the first published identification of these pigments in a work of fine art. Haku Maki’s unique ‘cement-on-woodblock’ printing technique in combination with his vibrant palette creates dynamic, embossed effects in these prints. However, lightfastness testing using a microfade tester identified the potential for light-based damage to the artwork, in some instances showing poorer lightfastness for colors reported to be stable pigments and greater stability than anticipated for others. These analyses are the first objective study of this innovative artist’s material choices, and they enhance our understanding of his printing technique while helping to determine the proper stewardship protocols to protect his artistic legacy.|$|E
30|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the darkening of chrome yellow pigments and have attributed this phenomenon to the reduction of Cr 6 + to Cr 3 + [21]. The reaction is accelerated by sunlight and the action of sulfurous pollutants, leading to a color shift from yellow to brown. The color change observed in Fig.  8 for the chrome yellow paint used in the Haku Maki prints, changing slightly faster than BWS 3, is therefore not surprising. The orange paint characterized as a mixture of chrome yellow and <b>molybdate</b> <b>orange,</b> however, altered even faster than pure chrome yellow, showing a rate of color change approximately halfway between BWS 2 and 3. This result raises concerns regarding its exposure to exhibition lighting. Analysis of the individual color coordinates indicated that the orange paint shifted to become darker, less red, and less yellow.|$|E
