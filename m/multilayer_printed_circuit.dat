Multiple strands of wire may introduce cross-talk between circuits, of little consequence for digital circuits but a limitation for analog systems.

All interconnections between the cards were done with <b>multilayer</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> backwiring boards, and all input/output interface had the same standard form.

40|$|Power {{distribution}} network (PDN) of a <b>multilayered</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board {{is designed to}} supply low noise and stable power to ICs. Reduced voltage levels and increasing current-supply requirements accentuates the PDN design complexity. It therefore becomes necessary to have multiple design iterations to achieve an optimal impedance profile for the PDN. 3 D full-wave electromagnetic solvers, like the Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method, are accurate but suffer from high compute time requirements, which prohibit its use in the early design phase iterations. On the other hand, pure 2. 5 D methods, like the non-orthogonal 2. 5 D PEEC approach, have lower time and memory requirements but fail to capture coplanar coupling due to the underlying TEM assumptions. This affects the accuracy of PDN modeling for coplanar power-ground or signal-power configurations. In this work, the non-orthogonal 2. 5 D PEEC formulation is extended to include coplanar mutual coupling.

Furthermore, for the analysis of electrically long cavities, the use of several rings of images surrounding the entire cavity at different heights is employed. Using the special features of the formulation, a new method of moments implementation combined with the spatial images technique is proposed in order to efficiently analyze practical <b>multilayered</b> <b>printed</b> filters, considerably reducing the computational cost.

40|$|Design of {{the power}} ground layout of a <b>multilayered</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB) is crucial for low noise and stable power supply. 2. 5 -D tools are better suited for early stage power {{distribution}} network (PDN) analysis over 3 -D full-wave electromagnetic solvers due to faster simulation times. For example, the multilayered finite difference method (MFDM), {{which is based on}} a 2. 5 -D formulation on an orthogonal mesh grid, can accurately model and analyze power planes. However, this method loses its advantage while analyzing planes with irregular shapes and holes, which require unnecessarily fine discretization at boundaries for a suitable staircase approximation in an orthogonal grid.

It adopts a different scanning way to successfully produce cross-sectional images of the plate-type objects, while the conventional CT cannot be used. According to the CL reconstruction algorithm, precise determination {{of the origin of}} the projection coordinate system is the first step during cone-beam CL scanning system calibration. But unfortunately, for the practical CL scanning system, it is impossible to measure the position of the X-ray focus projection by direct means. A new method to determine the X-ray focus projection coordinates with high accuracy is proposed. Firstly the angle between the central X-ray and the axis of rotation is set to zero by rotating the X-ray source and detector synchronously. Acquiring digital radiography (DR) images of several spherical objects at two geometrical magnification ratio positions in the cone X-ray beam, the two DR images are combined to one image, on the base of which image processing methods are employed to get the center points of each projection of the spherical object. And every two-positioned center points of the same spherical object determine a line, so all couples of projection centers of all the spherical objects construct a group of lines, mathematically an over-determined equation set. After solving the over-determined equation, the X-ray focus projection coordinates are finally obtained. The experimental results prove that the accuracy of this method can satisfy the requirements of the practical scanning system, meanwhile it is feasible to realize.
