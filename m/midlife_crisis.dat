5|$|Ray Pascoe, a fan, {{made the}} 1995 film Something To Aim At, a project he {{began in the}} years {{following}} Simpson's death; the film includes interviews with those closest to Simpson. The 2005 documentary Wheels Within Wheels follows actor Simon Dutton as he searches for people and places in Simpson's life. Dutton's four-year project chronicles the <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis</b> that sparked his quest to rediscover Simpson. British rider David Millar won stage twelve of the 2012 Tour de France on the 45th anniversary of Simpson's death; previously banned from cycling for using performance-enhancing drugs, he paid tribute to Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his– and Simpson's– mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, Cycling is My Life, published in 2009. In 2010, Simpson was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. He inspired Simpson Magazine, which began in March 2013. According to the magazine's creators, “It was Simpson's spirit and style, his legendary tenacity and his ability to suffer that endeared him to cycling fans everywhere as much as the trophies he won”.|$|E

40|$|This third {{paper in}} a series about the dwarf galaxy populations in groups within the Local Supercluster {{concerns}} the intermediate mass (2. 1 · 10 13 M⊙) NGC 5353 / 4 Group with a core dominated by S 0 systems and a periphery of mostly spiral systems. Dwarf galaxies are strongly concentrated toward the core. The mass to light ratio M/LR = 105 M⊙/L ⊙ is a factor 3 lower than {{for the two groups}} studied earlier in the series. The properties of the group suggest it is much less dynamically evolved than those two groups of early type galaxies. By comparison, the NGC 5353 / 4 Group lacks superluminous systems but has a large fraction of intermediate luminosity galaxies; or equivalently, a luminosity function with a flatter faint end slope. The luminosity function for the NGC 5353 / 4 Group should steepen as the intermediate luminosity galaxies merge. Evidence for the ongoing collapse of the group is provided by the unusually large incidence of star formation activity in small galaxies with early morphological types. The pattern in the distribution of galaxies with activity suggests a succession of infall events. Residual gas in dwarfs that enter the group is used up in sputtering events.

40|$|Roddy Doyle {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Irish literary figures of our time. The vicissitudes of Irish middle class families, domestic violence, prominent events in Irish history and Ireland’s new multiculturalism are some of the leading themes that he employs in his works. His short story collection Bullfighting (2011) is unique in dealing with a subject matter unfamiliar in his other works: the <b>midlife</b> <b>crises</b> of working-class men. Specifically, the short stories “Recuperation”, “Teaching”, and “Bullfighting” revolve around middle aged men who have no expectations in life and are entrapped in vicious familial, matrimonial or socio-cultural circles. In a similar way to the aforementioned short stories, Doyle’s novel Two Pints (2012) recounts the pub meetings of two Irish men in late middle age. A reflection of each other, these men chat about various subjects such as politics, economy, and dead celebrities, forging bonds as they drink pints together. It could be possible to claim that these two men offer a counterpoint to the male characters found in Bullfighting. They have given up questioning their lives, accepting the facts of life as they are. Bearing all this in mind, this paper aims to analyse the following points: 1) if we compare Bullfighting and his most recent work, Doyle’s characters seem to have become older and less pessimistic; 2) the motifs of the pint and the pub meeting function as therapy for his male characters; 3) the tones of both works differ: the bleak tone of the short stories has given way to a humorous tone in the novel. In short, with its aged male characters, Two Pints represents a more light-hearted, humorous version of certain stories in Bullfighting...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{theoretical}} analysis, in {{the present}} paper, we defined {{the structure of the}} characteristics of personality psychological maturity, which is considered an adult development criterion. The objective of this paper was to identify the mechanisms that contribute to the formation of psychological maturity in adulthood development. We first assumed that one of the possible mechanisms is the normative crisis of development. In turn, previously formed psychological maturity traits can relieve the experiences associated with this normative crisis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the formation of psychological maturity during periods of emerging and middle adulthood, with a specific focus on normative crisis experiences. The study design included cross-sectional and longitudinal methods. The participants included 309 adults. The emerging adulthood group ranged in age from 18 to 25 years, and the participants in the middle adulthood group were between 38 and 45 years of age. To study crisis events and experiences, we used three author-designed questionnaires. A self-actualization test by E. Shostrom (SAT), the Big Five personality test by Costa and MacCrae, a value and availability ratio in various vital spheres technique by E. B. Fantalova, a purpose-in-life test by D. A. Leontiev, and a coping test by Lazarus were used to define the personality characteristics used to overcome difficult life situations. In this paper, we described experiences specific to the crises associated with emerging adulthood and middle adulthood in the context of developmental tasks. Using cluster analysis, we defined groups with different intensities of crisis experiences and analyzed psychological content of crisis experiences in different groups. Using ANOVA, we found that participants with low intensity crisis experiences show more developed characteristics of psychological maturity. During emerging adulthood, the overcoming of crises associated with the separation from family contributes to the formation of such aspects of psychological maturity as self-management, life organization and responsibility. In a longitudinal study of <b>midlife</b> <b>crises,</b> the data suggest that in groups where there are more intense crisis experiences, there are more significant dynamics in the meaning and value sphere over the course of a year that lead to the achievement of greater personal integrity and congruence. The current study proved the hypothesis regarding the role of the crisis mechanism of psychological maturity development in two phases of adulthood. It also proved that psychological maturity contributes to a decrease in the intensity of crisis experiences. ...|$|R
