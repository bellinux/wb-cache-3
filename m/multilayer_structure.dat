40|$|Layered {{discretization}} is {{an efficient}} way of realizing thermal cloaks. The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate the effect of nonlinear coordinate transformation on the thermal cloaking performance of multilayered cylindrical thermal cloak. Two indexes are defined to quantify the thermal cloaking performance. Nonlinear coordinate transformations with different forms are established to design the <b>multilayered</b> <b>structures</b> and the thermal cloaking performances are analyzed by full-wave simulations. The results show that the thermal cloaking performances of <b>multilayered</b> <b>structures</b> are directly influenced by the form of coordinate transformation which determines the distributions of heat flows in the cloak region. Through the active changing of the form of coordinate transformation, the thermal cloaking performance of <b>multilayered</b> <b>structure</b> can be controlled and optimized. In addition, a three-piecewise linear coordinate transformation is designed to concentrate the heat flux into the middle region of the cloak and the corresponding <b>multilayered</b> <b>structure</b> is demonstrated to have near-perfect thermal cloaking performance.

Partial-thickness tissue engineering uses one type of cell layer, this can be in monolayers or multilayers.

Oral mucosa, however, is a complex <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure</b> with proliferating and differentiating cells and monolayer epithelial sheets have been shown to be fragile, difficult to handle and likely to contract without a supporting extracellular matrix. Monolayer epithelial sheets can be used to manufacture multilayer cultures. These multilayer epithelial sheets show signs of differentiation such as the formation of a basement membrane and keratinization. Fibroblasts are the most common cells in extracellular matrix and are important for epithelial morphogenesis. If fibroblasts are absent from the matrix, the epithelium stops proliferating but continues to differentiate.

40|$|Several topics {{concerning}} the imaging properties of patterned multilayer mask structures are addressed. Using the split-step beam propagation method {{in conjunction with}} linear systems theory, the reflected electric field from a patterned <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure</b> is calculated. This calculation accounts for the finite thickness of the pattern structure and the angular dependence of the multilayer reflector. A coherence mapping relationship is developed for a patterned <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure</b> placed in the object plane of an optical system. It is shown that both the spatial period of the pattern structure {{as well as the}} angular dependence of the multilayer reflector determines when a simulation must include angular dependence in the coherence mapping. If the illumination system is non-telecentric, a spatially dependent variation of the image irradiance occurs over the field of view of the optical system. A source with a finite spectral bandwidth causes a substantial irradiance decrease in the final image, due to the spectral dependence of the <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure.</b> In an effort to analyze the effects of roughness in short-wavelength imaging systems, the theory of speckle in partially coherent imaging systems is expanded to include the effects of a pattern structure, as well as imaging system aberrations. Including a pattern structure causes the partially developed speckle to manifest itself as a line edge roughness (LER) in images printed in a binary photoresist. It is shown that the LER can increase as the system becomes more incoherent. It is also shown that defocus causes LER produced in the image plane to dramatically increase. An iterative algorithm is developed to calculate the reflected electric field from a rough <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure,</b> which uses no first-order phase approximation and includes the effects of diffraction within the structure. The iterative algorithm is used with the coherence theory developed in this dissertation to analyze the imaging properties of a patterned <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure.</b> Including the effects of the <b>multilayer</b> <b>structure</b> and the thick pattern in the simulation results in an increase in LER, a slight shift in the ideal focus position and an asymmetry in LER for off-axis illumination...|$|E
