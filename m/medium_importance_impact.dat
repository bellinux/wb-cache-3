40|$|Class of 2006 AbstractObjectives: To {{assess the}} walkability of neighborhoods {{surrounding}} six {{elementary schools in}} Nogales, Arizona. Methods: This descriptive study used a walkability tool to assess the walkability of the six neighborhoods in Nogales, Arizona. Evaluators used the tool to rank the following variables: high importance (pedestrian facilities, pedestrian conflicts, crosswalks), <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> (maintenance, path size, buffer, universal accessibility, aesthetics), and low importance (shade). A {{mean and standard deviation}} for the total score from all schools was calculated and compared to a standard walkability score for good neighborhood walkability using a one sample t-test. Results: Walkability scores for each neighborhood ranged between 44. 5 (Vasquez de Coronado Francisco) and 83 (Lincoln). There was no significant difference found for mean scores for high and low importance items. The mean score for buffer was significantly lower than other <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> items (p< 0. 05). The total walkability score (67. 4) for all schools was not significantly different from the standard walkability score (70). Conclusions: The neighborhoods surrounding elementary schools in Nogales, Arizona met walkability standards. Interestingly, the neighborhoods around older schools scored higher than those around newer schools...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} examining salient memories {{have demonstrated}} that personal memories {{that are important to}} individuals and contain emotional information are better remembered than neutral events. Using behavioral and brain-imaging experiments, the present studies explored whether the previous finding was applicable imagined loss. In a behavioral experiment, a free recall paradigm was used to compare the memory performance of individuals who imagined loss with that of individuals who imagined importance. The superior memory performance conferred by imagining loss was constrained to ordinary items of low to <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> and did not generalize to vital items. Moreover, brain imaging evidence revealed that the activation in certain brain regions was stronger when participants were imagining the loss of ordinary items of low to <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> compared to vital items. These brain regions included cognitive effort-related areas (such as the parietal cortex and middle prefrontal cortex) and areas related to emotional experiences and emotion-related memories (such as the amygdala, parahippocampal gyms, and posterior cingulate gyms). Our study provides a new way of exploring the superior memory performance when imagining loss and enriches the literature on memory enhancement by contributing to {{a deeper understanding of the}} psychological mechanisms related to the imagining of vital losses...|$|R

Using a survey adapted from Saccol et al. (2004), the study evaluated a series of strategic factors: customers and consumers, competitive rivalry, suppliers, organizational efficiency and effectiveness, and interorganizational efficiency. The results showed a medium-to-low relevance of the system for the stated factors and confirm the literature, indicating smaller and greater strategic use for smaller (small) and larger (mediumsized) companies, respectively. In particular, the smallest differences between small and medium-sized companies are found in the competitive rivalry factor and the largest differences in the inter-organizational efficiency factor. We conclude that ERP systems are of <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> for the strategic aspects of small and medium-sized companies but are the basis for further strategic support...|$|R

This new line {{involved}} less construction and crossed easier terrain than the direct Brunswick-Helmstedt line opened in 1872, which forms {{part of the}} present Brunswick-Magdeburg line. Other lines were built connecting to the Wolfenbüttel-Helmstedt line, particularly at Jerxheim. On 1 May 1868 a link was opened between Jerxheim and Börßum, connecting to the Brunswick Southern Railway to Kreiensen (the western section of this line is now the Warne Valley Railway from Börßum to Salzgitter-Bad). On 15 September 1872 the Eilsleben-Völpke-Schöningen line opened. These lines were particularly important for long-distance freight trains and also were used by occasional express passenger trains. Later branch lines were added to Dedeleben and Nienhagen and the Brunswick-Schöningen line. The sections from Wolfenbüttel to Jerxheim and between Schöningen and Helmstedt, however, had only <b>medium</b> <b>importance</b> and were not used by express trains in 1914 or 1939.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} two coupled phase oscillators in {{the presence}} of proportional ("common") and independent white noises. The global synchronization properties of the system are analytically studied via the Fokker-Planck equation. When the "effective coupling" is big compared to the common noises, the former favors and the latter hinder synchronization. On the contrary, when the coupling is small compared to the proportional noises, we find that the latter induce synchronization, optimally when their intensities are big and in the n:m synchronization ratio. Furthermore, in such case a small value of the coupling is better for synchronization. Finally, we show that synchronization, which is a global property, must not be studied via local stability such as with Lyapunov exponents. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, revtex. Added an example that shows that synchronization, which is a global property, must not be studied by means of a local stability analysis such as via Lyapunov exponents.

If a company relies solely on one supplier, it may interrupt the flow of production due to failure to deliver material. Suppliers can demonstrate its strength mainly by increasing prices or reducing the quality of supplied materials. In the wine sector, there are the following major groups of suppliers: feedstock suppliers (wine grapes), suppliers of chemical additives and other substances necessary for the production of wine, suppliers of manufacturing technology, suppliers of packaging materials, energy suppliers and other vendors. Highest bargaining power is currently available to suppliers of energy, because energy is an essential resource for the industry and there are few suppliers of this product. But their bargaining power gradually decreases depending on the liberalization of energy markets, supported by interest in this area. Overall, it can be stated that the bargaining effect is of <b>medium</b> <b>importance...</b>|$|R
