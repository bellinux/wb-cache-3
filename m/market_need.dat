Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program. In the course of preparing reagents for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product, that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of glutethimide, a sedative, and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug; the result was thalidomide. [...] The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 84 - 88. This study {{focuses on}} the nature and degree of {{articulation}} between Technikon education and labour <b>market</b> <b>needs</b> in South Africa. More specifically, it examines {{the effectiveness of the}} assessment of labour <b>market</b> <b>needs</b> as well as the influence of institutional needs and dynamics within the formal decision-making process which governs the introduction of new programmes. The research {{takes the form of a}} case study in which the researcher examines the decision-making process relating to the introduction of a particular programme - the ND: Education: Home Economics - at a particular Technikon. Data consisted of official records and documents as well as transcripts of interviews with key participants in the decision-making process. The data was used to reconstruct and analyse the decision-making process as implemented in the case of this programme. The study argues that, in this case, the formal, prescribed process which purported to assess labour <b>market</b> <b>needs</b> did not effectively engage with the actual dynamics of the market place. The mechanisms designed to assess labour <b>market</b> <b>needs</b> were largely symbolic and highly bureaucratised. In addition to being weak in design, assessment procedures were not stringently implemented. While the introduction of new programmes is explicitly justified on the grounds of labour <b>market</b> <b>needs,</b> the decision-making process was in this case, strongly - though implicitly and informally - influenced by institutional needs and dynamics within the Technikon itself. This study points to the weaknesses in the design and control of the official prescribed process which guides decisions regarding the introduction of all new programmes at South African Technikons. On a theoretical level, it also calls into question an assumption on which much literature pertaining to Technikon education is premised, that is, the assumption that there is a relatively smooth articulation between the supply of Technikon graduates and labour <b>market</b> <b>needs...</b>|$|R
