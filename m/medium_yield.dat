By including 100 mM Ca 2 + {{in the growth}} <b>medium,</b> secreted <b>yields</b> of more than 50 mg/liter could be achieved using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) complete medium. In a soya <b>medium</b> <b>yields</b> of up to 150 mg/liter were achieved.

Sequence differences between the three lysozymes, EqL, HuL, and HEWL, resulted in different susceptibilities to cleavage by A. niger proteases.
