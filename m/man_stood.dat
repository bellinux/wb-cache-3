25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable events are protests during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of China by Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, the Tiananmen Square protests in 1976 {{after the death of}} Zhou Enlai, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 after the death of Hu Yaobang, the latter resulted in military suppression. One of the most famous images that appears during these protests was when a <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> in front of a line of moving tanks and refused to move, which was captured on Chang'an Avenue near the square.|$|E

During this innings, watched by {{a crowd of}} 20,000, Flintoff hit a six into the top tier of the Ryder Stand. A <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> to claim the catch and dropped it – it was Flintoff's father. Over the course of England's record-breaking summer, he hit a half-century in all seven victorious Tests against New Zealand and the West Indies. On returning to the one-day game as an all-rounder in September he fell agonisingly short of a third one-day century, caught on 99 against India, though {{he went on to}} hit a further century in the ICC Champions Trophy pool match against Sri Lanka two weeks later.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 December, Bhutto met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the afternoon, she gave a speech at a PPP rally held in Rawalpindi's Liaquat National Bagh. On leaving in a {{bulletproof}} vehicle, she opened the car's escape hatch and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds. A <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> within two to three metres of the car, fired three gunshots at her, and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. Bhutto was fatally injured; reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. No autopsy was conducted, and the body was swiftly transported to Chaklala Air Base. The following day, she was buried next to her father in the Bhutto family mausoleum, Garhi Khuda Baksh, her family graveyard near Larkana. PPP supporters rioted {{in various parts of}} Pakistan.|$|E

[...] When a young <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> before him for sentencing after admitting to stealing jewels from a parcel, the defendant's wife stood near him, infant daughter in her arms, and Landis mused what to do about the situation. After a dramatic pause, Landis ordered the young man to take his wife and daughter and go home with them, expressing his unwillingness to have the girl be the daughter of a convict.

500|$|In 1975, {{the activist}} {{citizens}} group Lehigh-Pocono Committee of Concern (LEPOCO) formed a [...] "human peace candle" [...] {{in front of}} the real structure as a protest against the Vietnam War. Three group members formed a triangle while another <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> on top of their shoulders, holding a lighted candle and a sign that read, [...] "Bring the troops home for Christmas {{and the rest of the}} year". The protest marked the 10th anniversary of LEPOCO's first protest against the war when they formed in 1965, which was also held at Center Square. In December 1981, the Polish labor union Solidarity held a late-night peace rally that included a candlelight vigil, singing and prayers for a peaceful resolution to the martial law crisis in Poland. In 1991, the city decided to leave the Peace Candle standing until the Gulf War conflict was resolved in honor of the 500,000 American troops serving in the war. The gesture was approved after a pool of residents indicated a ratio of 10-to-1 supported it. During this time, supporters of the troops tied yellow ribbons around the candle and its surrounding fence, while protesters tied black ribbons to symbolize those who died in the conflict. The candle was taken down that March after the war ended.|$|E

500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Richards Vidmer {{opened his}} account of the game as follows: [...] "The {{greatest}} naval disaster of them all took place on Ferry Field today when a hungry pack of Wolverines set upon the Navy eleven from Annapolis, snarled and snapped, chewed and clawed, and finally buried the Easterners under a defeat of 54 to 0. [...] It probably was the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would probably {{go down in history as}} Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port tonight on the leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." ...|$|E
500|$|Television pundits have criticised {{the writing}} of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts [...] "often corny, even painfully so", using Monty Everard's line [...] "You'll come to regret {{crossing}} swords with me, sir!" [...] from [...] "Health Hazard" [...] (2003) as an example. Hanks also wrote about what he called [...] "moral oversimplification" [...] of the storylines; the same episode featured [...] "a wealthy and self-important businessman—who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving—ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at—the icing on this shabby cake—Downing Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> up and started protesting vociferously". The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios. Andy Hamilton called the dialogue [...] "the funniest on TV" [...] and David Mitchell selected it as his [...] "TV hell" [...] in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Deed's [...] "swashbuckling" [...] persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers. Despite the criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships.|$|E

2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a <b>man</b> <b>stood</b> up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E
