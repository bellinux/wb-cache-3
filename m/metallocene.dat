5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system {{was to understand the}} nature of and bonding within the <b>metallocene</b> class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when <b>metallocene</b> systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) <b>metallocene</b> polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E
5|$|Organozirconium {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of compounds containing a carbon-zirconium bond. The first such compound was zirconocene dibromide ((C5H5)2ZrBr2), reported in 1952 by Birmingham and Wilkinson. Schwartz's reagent, prepared in 1970 by P. C. Wailes and H. Weigold, is a <b>metallocene</b> used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered <b>metallocene</b> sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a <b>metallocene</b> although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metallocenes</b> {{generally}} have high thermal stability. Ferrocene can be sublimed in air at over 100 °C with no decomposition; <b>metallocenes</b> are generally purified by vacuum sublimation. Charge-neutral <b>metallocenes</b> are soluble in common organic solvents. Alkyl substituted derivative are particularly soluble, even in alkane solvents.|$|R
50|$|Ni(C5H5)2 {{belongs to}} a group of {{organometallic}} compounds called <b>metallocenes.</b> <b>Metallocenes</b> usually adopt structures in which a metal ion is sandwiched between two parallel cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings. In the solid-state, the molecule has D5h symmetry, wherein the two rings are eclipsed.|$|R

5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk <b>metallocene</b> complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using <b>metallocene</b> derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metallocene</b> {{polyethylene}} (PE-M) {{is prepared}} {{by means of}} <b>metallocene</b> catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). <b>Metallocene</b> polyethylene has a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). <b>Metallocene</b> polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{synthesis}} of syndiotactic polypropylene {{is carried out}} {{with the use of}} a special class of <b>metallocene</b> catalysts. They employ bridged bis-metallocene complexes of the type bridge-(Cp1)(Cp2)ZrCl2 where the first Cp ligand is the cyclopentadienyl group, the second Cp ligand is the fluorenyl group, and the bridge between the two Cp ligands is -CH2-CH2-, >SiMe2, or >SiPh2. These complexes are converted to polymerization catalysts by activating them with a special organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane (MAO).|$|E
25|$|VLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.880–0.915nbsp&g/cm3. VLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer {{with high levels of}} short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using <b>metallocene</b> catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.|$|E
25|$|A Ziegler-Natta {{catalyst}} is able {{to restrict}} linking of monomer molecules to a specific regular orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side {{with respect to the}} backbone of the polymer chain, or syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble <b>metallocene</b> catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.|$|E

25|$|HDPE {{is defined}} by a density of greater or equal to 0.941nbsp&g/cm3. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear {{molecules}} pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts or <b>metallocene</b> catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, {{the small amount of}} branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add {{to the ends of the}} molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.|$|E
500|$|The {{stability}} of metallocenes changes with ring substitution. Comparing the reduction potentials of the cobaltocenium and decamethylcobaltocenium cations {{shows that the}} decamethyl species is ca. 600mV more reducing than its parent <b>metallocene,</b> a situation also observed in the ferrocene and rhodocene systems. The following data are presented relative to the ferrocenium / ferrocene redox couple: ...|$|E
500|$|Structural {{studies of}} termetallocene systems have shown they {{typically}} adopt an [...] "eclipsed double transoid" [...] "crankshaft" [...] geometry. Taking {{as an example}} the 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene cation shown above, {{this means that the}} cobaltocenyl and rhodocenyl moieties are eclipsed, and thus carbon atoms 1 and 1' on the central ferrocene core are as close to vertically aligned as is possible given the staggered conformation of the cyclopentadienyl rings within each <b>metallocene</b> unit. Viewed from side-on, this means termetallocenes resemble the down–up–down pattern of a crankshaft. The synthesis of this termetallocene involves the combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with 1,1'-dilithioferrocene. This produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl–cyclopentadiene ligands whose bonding resembles that found in the rhodocene dimer. These ligands then react with the triphenylmethyl carbocation to generate the termetallocene salt, (PF6)2. This synthetic pathway is illustrated below: ...|$|E
