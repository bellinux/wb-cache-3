5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> experienced population {{drops in}} the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} {{of the tribe}} Monachini. They are the only earless seals found in {{tropical}} climates. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
5|$|In early 2005, a {{severely}} wounded Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> (Monachus monachus) was {{found within the}} Büyük Menderes Delta. It was treated immediately, but due to complications died shortly afterwards. The Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> is critically endangered, with only about 600 remaining in the world, and over 100 of which are within the maritime borders of Turkey.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> had a {{relatively}} large, long, robust body, could grow to nearly [...] {{in length and}} weighed [...] Males were probably slightly larger than females, {{which is similar to}} Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Like other <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended broad muzzle. The face had relatively large wide-spaced eyes, upward opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long light-colored and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the more paler and yellowish younger <b>seals.</b> Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> were also known to have algae growing on their pelage, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> can be {{affected}} by the toxoplasmosis pathogen in cat feces that enters the ocean in polluted runoff and wastewater, a new phenomenon. Over the past ten years, toxoplasmosis killed at least four seals. Other human-introduced pathogens, including leptospirosis, have infected <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} {{for the preservation of}} the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> and Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|To raise {{awareness}} of the species' plight, on June 11, 2008, a state law designated the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> as Hawaii's official State Mammal.|$|E
5000|$|Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they}} also prey on cephalopods, and crustaceans.

5|$|NOAA {{cultivated}} {{a network}} of volunteers to protect the seals while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health {{in conjunction with the}} Marine Mammal Center. From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed in order <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> The program also creates networks with the Native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of the seals. The Marine Mammal Response Network (MMRN) is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> further protection.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups among the {{foundations}} concentrating their efforts towards {{the preservation of the}} Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Akdeniz Foklarını Araştırma Grubu) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG).

5|$|The Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> has {{the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} supports 7,000 species, {{one quarter}} of which are endemic. Prominent species include the endangered hawksbill sea turtle, the threatened green sea turtle and the endangered Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> the Laysan and Nihoa finches, the Nihoa millerbird, Laysan duck, seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, numerous species of plants including Pritchardia palms, and many species of arthropods. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, populations of lobster have not recovered from extensive harvesting in the 1980s and 1990s, which is now banned; the remaining fisheries are overfished.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, {{as well as}} {{a collection}} of animals, the bulk of which dates back to the 19th century.

5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian <b>Monk</b> <b>Seal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E
5000|$|Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{had a long}} pupping season, {{which is}} typical for {{pinnipeds}} living in subtropical and tropical habitats. In Mexico, breeding season peaked in early December. Like other <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> this species had four retractable nipples for suckling their young. Newborn pups were probably about 1 m in length and weighed 16 to 18 kg and reportedly had a sleek, black lanugo coat when born. [...] It is believed this animal's average lifespan was approximately twenty years.|$|R
50|$|In the {{framework}} of the Action Plan, a Nature Reserve was created in the Desertas Islands in the Madeira archipelago. This reserve was crucial in increasing the number of <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> from 6-8 individuals in the 1980s to 25-30 in 2009. Furthermore, the establishment of a no-fishing zone and the elimination of disturbances in the vicinity of breeding grounds have helped raise the number of <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula from 100 to 200 in the 1997-2009 period.|$|R
50|$|Along with Linosa, Lampedusa {{once was}} a stronghold for {{critically}} endangered Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> until 1950s and {{they are likely to}} be regional extinct today.|$|R
5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean <b>monk</b> <b>seal.</b> After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|R
