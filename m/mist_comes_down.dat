50|$|The story {{takes place}} on Wraithworld, a barely {{habitable}} planet with unusual weather conditions. Each morning in a wonderful phenomenon, the <b>mist</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> from the mountains, revealing {{the beauty of the}} planet. This phenomenon is called Mistfall.|$|E
6000|$|The western tide {{crept up}} along the sand, [...] And o'er and o'er the sand, [...] And round and round the sand, [...] As far as eye could see. The rolling <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> and hid the land: [...] And never home came she.|$|R
60|$|But {{this storm}} {{was not of}} the thunder and {{lightning}} variety, nor did it blow to any extent. It grew damp and foggy, and then a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> over the ocean, shutting out the view upon every side. At once the engine of the steam yacht was slowed down, and a double lookout was stationed at the bow, while the whistle was blown at regular intervals.|$|R
60|$|It was {{in reality}} north-east, but Jager's intellects were muddled; {{he made it}} out to be {{south-west}} and steered accordingly, almost straight before it. The three men who formed the crew of the little vessel were so angry at the treatment they had received, that they neither cared nor knew how the ship's head lay. A thick <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> about the same time, and veiled the lights which would otherwise have soon revealed the fact that the skipper had made a mistake.|$|R
60|$|In {{the east}} of Java I had {{suffered}} from the intense heat and drought of the dry season, which had been very inimical to insect life. Here I had got into the other extreme of damp, wet, and cloudy weather, which was equally unfavourable. During the month which I spent {{in the interior of}} West Java, I never had a really hot fine day throughout. It rained almost every afternoon, or dense <b>mists</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> from the mountains, which equally stopped collecting, and rendered it most difficult to dry my specimens, so that I really had no chance of getting a fair sample of Javanese entomology.|$|R
60|$|I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, {{and rose}} with a torn ear and {{bleeding}} face. I {{had fallen into}} a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a narrow streamlet from which this <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> meandering <b>down</b> the centre. I was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I {{had no time to}} stand wondering then. I turned to my right, down-stream, hoping to come to the sea in that direction, and so have my way open to drown myself. It was only later I found that I had dropped my nailed stick in my fall.|$|R
60|$|And so merrily {{the hours}} passed away, {{until it was}} time to break up and put out the lights. And as the young fellows laughed and sung, while the <b>mist</b> and rain <b>came</b> <b>down</b> pitilessly outside, they little thought what was {{preparing}} for the morrow, or dreamed that the churches in Sebastopol were crowded with Russian soldiers praying the saints to give them victory on the morrow, and to aid them to drive the enemies of the Czar into the sea.|$|R
50|$|Ken Crocket quotes Sheriff G.D. Valentine “The stalker’s cap, {{the loose}} jacket and the knickerbockers, which he wore suited the man; {{they seemed to}} grow out of him.He had the {{characteristics}} of the Highlander; the courtesy joined to self respect that are the heritage of the clans. His accent to the end smacked of the Gaelic speaker. His features were strong and embrowned by weather. He wore the old style of short beard, whiskers and moustache. Always alert, always cheerful, he was the perfect companion, but it was when the <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> swirling <b>down</b> on the wet rocks that his true worth was known.” Crocket notes that in is career MacKenzie must have guided thousands of tourists and climbers without one recorded accident, a remarkable achievement for anyone working in such an unforgiving environment, arguably Britain’s most challenging range of hills. His achievements were recognised by the Alpine Club who made him something akin to an honorary member and mailed him their journal. MacKenzie never climbed outside Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|According to Hyginus: [...] "From <b>Mist</b> (Caligine) <b>came</b> Chaos. From Chaos and <b>Mist,</b> <b>came</b> Night (Nox), Day (Dies), Darkness (Erebus), and Ether (Aether)." [...] An Orphic {{tradition}} {{apparently had}} Chaos {{as the son}} of Chronus and Ananke.|$|R
60|$|Just {{after it}} {{passed through the}} passage of the Lido, a thick <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> on. Pisani stamped up and down the deck impatiently.|$|R
60|$|Gavin lay prone {{and peered}} at the river, but the <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> up to his eyes. He only knew that the river was below from the sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "Many {{others would}} have felt as we do, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Meyrick, feeling a <b>mist</b> <b>come</b> over {{her eyes as she}} looked at her work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand {{here and}} look," [...] {{answered}} Sam, and his uncle did as requested. Presently {{from out of}} the <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> the form of a man - the likeness of Randolph Rover himself! ...|$|R
60|$|Toward noon a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> up, and it grew dark. Lanterns were lit, and the Tacoma {{felt her}} way along carefully, for Captain Fairleigh {{knew that they}} were now in the track of {{considerable}} shipping.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{took the}} hand, and shook it, {{and then a}} <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> over his eyes, and his knees tottered, as, with the ringing cheers {{of the men in}} his ears, he fainted into his second's arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "My mother is," [...] said Cornelia; {{the words}} {{brought up a}} vision of her mother, as she must be sitting that moment in the little front-room, and a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> {{suddenly}} before her eyes; she shut her lips hard {{to keep them from}} trembling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not already! Oh, not already!" [...] Thus Aline {{expressed}} the silently communicated thought. She experienced a difficulty in breathing, felt the sudden need of air. Something {{in her throat}} was throbbing {{as if it would}} suffocate her; a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> and went before her eyes.|$|R
60|$|A <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> before Caleb's {{eyes and}} in it across the years he saw himself a boy again. There he stood, his rod of reed bent double and the thin line {{strained}} almost to breaking, while on the waters of Jordan a great fish splashed and rolled.|$|R
60|$|A <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> {{before my}} eyes, and my tongue failed me, but Bill let off a roar, such as I {{have never heard}} before or since. It was {{answered}} from below, both aft and for'ard, and the men came running up on deck just as they left their beds.|$|R
60|$|The Company stood {{peering into}} the dense fog-wreath, amidst a silence so {{profound}} that the dripping of {{the water from the}} rocks and the breathing of the horses grew loud upon the ear. Suddenly from out the sea of <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> the shrill sound of a neigh, followed by a long blast upon a bugle.|$|R
60|$|Through the <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> {{a man at}} so feverish a {{pace that}} he seemed to dance with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a street-lamp. At each step he brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash. His glasses on their broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach. Babbitt incredulously saw that it was Chum Frink.|$|R

60|$|And now, for {{the first}} time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that {{housebreaking}} and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.|$|R

60|$|For {{several years}} they all lived happily together, when one day, {{as the girl}} {{was out on the}} hill with the kids, the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> {{creeping}}, creeping up from the sea. She rose with a shiver, and tried to call to her kids, but the voice died away in her throat, and strong arms seemed to hold her.|$|R
6000|$|The western wind {{is blowing}} fair Across the dark AEgean sea, And at the secret marble stair My Tyrian galley waits for thee. <b>Come</b> <b>down!</b> the purple sail is spread, The {{watchman}} sleeps within the town, O leave thy lily-flowered bed, O Lady mine <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> <b>come</b> <b>down!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, indeed," [...] cried Mrs. Petter. [...] "I wouldn't have {{believed}} it if angels had got down on their knees and sworn it to me. <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> from that ladder, Mr. Tippengray! <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> from it before I make my husband break it to bits beneath you. <b>Come</b> <b>down,</b> I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>came</b> <b>down</b> late {{to breakfast}} on the {{following}} morning, not being present at prayers, and when she <b>came</b> <b>down</b> she wore a bonnet.|$|R

6000|$|... "The air {{would do}} you good," [...] persisted Fraser; [...] "you could <b>come</b> <b>down</b> by train or <b>come</b> <b>down</b> {{with me on}} the Swallow next week." ...|$|R
6000|$|Skallagrim {{looked at}} Eric and spoke: [...] "Last night the <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> {{up against the}} wind: last night we saw Swanhild's wraith upon the waves, {{and there is the}} path it showed, and there"--and he pointed to the dead men--"is the witch-seed's flower. Now to-day we sit in Atli's hall and here we must stay this winter at Swanhild's side, and in all this there lies a riddle that I cannot read." ...|$|R
60|$|Henrietta {{tried to}} exclaim, to inquire, but her lips would not frame one word, her tongue {{would not leave}} the roof of her mouth. She heard a few {{confused}} sounds, and then a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> over her eyes, a rushing of waters in her ears, and she sank {{on the ground in}} a fainting fit. When she came to herself she was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room, and all was still.|$|R
60|$|The {{first part}} of this {{deposition}} did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.|$|R
60|$|But {{presently}} a <b>mist</b> <b>came</b> before Mr Clinton's eyes, {{everything seemed}} suddenly extraordinary, {{he had an}} intense pain and he felt himself falling. He opened his eyes slowly, and found himself sitting on a doorstep; a policeman was shaking him, asking what his name was. A woman standing by was holding his top hat; he noticed that his trousers were muddy, and mechanically {{he pulled out his}} handkerchief and began to wipe them.|$|R
