60|$|I TELL {{these things}} about my boy, {{not so much}} because they were {{peculiar}} to him as because I think they are, many of them, common to all boys. One tiresome fact about boys is that they are so much alike; or used to be. They did not wish to be so, but they could not help it. They did not even know they were alike; and my boy used to suffer in ways that he believed no boy had ever suffered before; but as he grew older he found that boys had been suffering {{in exactly the same way}} from the beginning of time. In the world you will find a great many grown-up boys, with gray beards and grandchildren, who think that they have been different their whole lives through from other people, and are the victims of destiny. That is because with all their growing they have never grown to be men, but have remained a sort of cry-babies. The first thing you have to learn here below is that in essentials you are just like every one else, and that you are different from others only in what is not so much worth while. If you have anything in common with your fellow-creatures, it is something that God gave you; if you have anything that seems quite your own, it is from your silly self, and is a sort of perversion of what came to you from the Creator who made you out of himself, and had nothing else to make any one out of. There is not really any difference between you and your fellow-creatures; but only a seeming difference that flatters and cheats you with a sense of your strangeness, and <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are a remarkable fellow.|$|E

5000|$|The {{emergence}} of a class of meta-jokes about blondes ("meta-blonde jokes", i.e., jokes about blonde jokes) is noted. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype. An example is about a blonde objecting to a ventriloquist act packed with sexist jokes about blondes: Blonde: [...] "I’ve heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can stereotype women that way? What does {{the color of a}} person’s hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It’s men like you that keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person. Because you and men like you continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes, but women in general, and {{all in the name of}} humor!"Ventriloquist: [...] "I'm sorry ma'am but..."Blonde: [...] "You stay out of this, mister!

5000|$|Critic Richard Newman in Books and Bookmen {{considered}} this dichotomy {{in his review}} of Wood's historical novel John Adam - Samurai. [...] "I just can't {{make up my mind}} about John Adam - Samurai - or, for that matter, its author, Christopher Wood. As a piece of sheer escapism, it's fantastic: it's got {{just the right amount of}} tongue-in-cheek cheekiness. My problem is — did he write it as a piece of cerebral fantasy to escape from the frustration of weekdays spent in a London advertising agency (in which case, bully for him); or does he want to be taken as a 'serious' author. To me, however, it's as if all the fantasies of this London advertising man ... had, at the advanced age of 36, broken out into a cold sweat. Psychiatrists tell us we should shed our fantasies by the time we reach our mid-thirties, so perhaps Christopher Wood is doing just that. And yet, underlying it all, one feels that he has done his homework and knows his Samurai very well. And he really <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are watching it all. Qualities like this are worth developing. His is the imagination which could come up with something really good." ...|$|E

40|$|Why {{at the end}} of the Goldberg Variations, Bach does write a Quodlibet {{in which}} he quotes two popular german songs of the XVIIIth century ? Arthur Rimbaud has written: “Man is soul and body”. The {{fundamental}} value of this issue is in the conjunction and: “A soul and a body”. What is it music if not the unity of our double nature? With the Quodlibet the phisycal aspect of music pours into the architecture of the Goldberg. Popular music has often poured in art music, both in secular and sacred music. What are looking for Schubert, Mendelssohn, Rossini, Liszt and many other european composers when they write Tarantellas? They are looking for that conjunction (and), and they look for it in south of Italy, in a dance like Tarantella because in those times south of Italy was the southern part of known world. Nowadays, the rhythmic vitality of Pizzica, where we can find ancestral musical echoes from the southern and eastern Mediterranean area, offers many hints to contemporary music. The most precious feature of popular music is its power to refer to something which is inside us, but in the meantime far away from us, something that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are at home even when you are elsewhere, in a place and in a time far away. In Luigi Chiriatti’s book Morso d’amore – Viaggio nel tarantismo salentino (1997), don Pietro, a priest from Galatina, says: “Tarantism today can be an alienation, but how many alienations do we have nowadays? The reasons at the origin of that kind of manifestations don’t exist any more. We have had a ultural transition and have appeared new different manifestations that have substituted the ancient ones”. Human being is always rooted in a certain time, in a certain history, but he remains a wayfarer looking for a place where his soul and his body feel good. La Notte della taranta has given an answer to this essential need that goes towards archaic domains, today removed but always necessary.

40|$|Beware of {{determining}} and declaring your opinion suddenly on any object, for imagination often gets {{the start of}} judgment and makes people believe they see things which better observations will convince them {{could not possibly be}} seen: therefore assert nothing till repeated experiments and examinations in all lights, and in all positions.

5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{source of}} these three approaches to finding happiness is based, according to Trungpa, on the mistaken notion that one's ego is inherently existent and a valid point of view. He claims that is incorrect, and therefore the materialistic approaches have an invalid basis to begin with. The message in summary is, [...] "Don't try to reinforce your ego through material things, belief systems like religion, or certain emotional states of mind." [...] In his view, the point of religion is {{to show you that}} your ego doesn't really exist inherently. Ego is something you build up to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> exist, but it is not necessary and in the long run causes more suffering.|$|R

2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror."
