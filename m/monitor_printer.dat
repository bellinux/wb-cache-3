40|$|The program DNAGEL {{is used to}} {{determine}} the size of DNA fragments run on agarose or polyacrylamide gels. The positions of the bands are read from gel photographs by means of a digitizer. Standard curves are calculated by the method of Southern (1979). The bands, as they are measured, are reproduced on the screen so that erroneous input can be recognized and corrected immediately. Similarly the estimated fragment sizes are printed in a table in the same relative positions as the bands on the gel. This makes it especially easy to relate fragment sizes with the bands on the gel picture. As an additional function the calculated positions of bands can be displayed on the screen. The program DNAGEL is written in APPLESOFT BASIC, suitable for APPLE II computers with 48 K memory connected to a <b>monitor,</b> <b>printer</b> and a HOUSTON graphics tablet...|$|E

40|$|Waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment {{is a complex}} waste stream and treatment options that work for one waste category or product may not be appropriate for others. A comprehensive case study has been performed for plastic-rich fractions that are treated in German dismantling centres. Plastics from TVs, <b>monitors</b> and <b>printers</b> and small household appliances have been characterised extensively. Based on the characterisation results, state-of-the-art treatment technologies have been combined to design an optimised recycling and upgrade process for each input fraction. High-impact polystyrene from TV casings that complies with the European directive on the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) was produced by applying continuous density separation with yields of about 60 %. Valuable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate can be extracted from <b>monitor</b> and <b>printer</b> casings by near-infrared-based sorting.
