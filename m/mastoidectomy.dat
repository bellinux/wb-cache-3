40|$|Introduction This paper {{deals with}} otologic {{surgical}} procedures {{performed in a}} an Ear, Nose and Throat Depertment during a 15 -year period. The authors compared the number of otologic surgical procedures {{with the number of}} laryngomicroscopies and procedures performed in Waldeyer's ring. RESULTS From January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2001, 1184 patients underwent the following surgical procedures in total endotracheal anesthesia: 285 paracenteses, 473 ventilation tubes insertions, 175 antrotomies or <b>mastoidectomies,</b> 194 tympanoplasties, 34 radical <b>mastoidectomies,</b> 4 facial nerve decompressions, 5 exostoses or osteoma of the external auditory canal operations and 14 stapedectomies. DISCUsSION Otologic surgical procedures are presented in table 1. In Yugoslav literature Topolac reports approximately 700 tympanoplasties in a 10 -year period (1968 - 1978). Radonjić and associates report 2272 ear operations in the period 1975 - 1985. Distribution of operations is presented in table 2, whereas in table 3 we can see that the number of operated ears is much greater than the number of operated patients. CONCLUSION We think that the number of operations is not bigger, because we operate only in critical cases. Our human and technical resources should provide advanced ear microsurgery, but only with financial and organizational support...|$|R

50|$|Gradually the {{operating}} microscope {{began to be}} used for ear operations. In the 1950s many otologists began to use it in the fenestration operation, usually to perfect the opening of the fenestra in the lateral semicircular canal. The revival of the stapes mobilization operation by Rosen, in 1953, made the use of the microscope mandatory, although it was not used by the originators of the technique, Kessel (1878), Boucheron (1888) and Miot (1890). <b>Mastoidectomies</b> began to be performed with the surgical microscope and so were the tympanoplasty techniques that became known in the early 1950s. The stapes mobilization operation had varying results and was soon replaced by stapedectomy, first described by John Shea, Jr.; this was an operation that was always performed with the microscope.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- While {{the main}} goals of surgery for chronic otitis media are {{elimination}} {{of disease and}} improving hearing, sometimes persistent drainage continues and mandates revision surgery. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the intraoperative findings during revision mastoid surgery and to ascertain the preventable factors. A total of 88 revision <b>mastoidectomies</b> performed from 1996 to 2000 at Amiralam university hospital in Tehran were reviewed. The most frequent findings during surgery were retained infected air cells, cholesteatoma and mucosal inflammation/granulation tissue. The overall success of revision surgery was 97. 5 %. (Providing a dry and safe ear) While hearing preservation is possible in most cases, improvement of hearing is a difficult goal in these patients.

40|$|The {{application}} of endoscopic surgery for middle ear pathologies is rapidly increasing. At present, its main application {{is in the}} treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma. This report describes the {{application of}} this technique as treatment for some benign lesions that may involve the middle ear cleft. A retrospective chart review of six patients who underwent exclusive endoscopic tympanic cavity surgery for benign neoplasms was performed between November 2011 and January 2012. Based on charts, images, and surgical reports, data from the patients were summarized for further consideration. All of the six lesions were in the tympanic cavity without involvement of the mastoid region. An exclusive endoscopic transcanal approach was used in all cases.

40|$|SummaryAim: This {{study is}} to {{determine}} the MMP 2 's presence in cholesteatomas and whether complicating cholesteatomas show a higher immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2. Cholesteatoma produces enzymesthat cause bone erosion like Matrixmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2). Material and MethodsWe analyzed the expression of MMP 2 in invasive (causing complications) compared to latent cholesteatomas (not causing complications). A crosssectional study with nineteen slides and paraffin blocks of cholesteatomas derived from <b>mastoidectomies</b> were located and processed, including 8 invasive and 11 latent cholesteatomas. Immunohistochemical thecnique was empregated to MMP 2. ResultsThe results are expressed as 0, + (to low), ++ and +++(high) according to the quantity and color of the immunohistochemical staining of MMP 2. Higher expression of MMP 2 was observed in 7 (87. 5 %) of the 8 invasive cholesteatomas. With respect to latent cholesteatomas, higher expression of MMP 2 was observed in 27. 3 % (3 cases), with Fisher's exact test indicating a significant difference (p= 0. 015). ConclusionsCholesteatoamas express MMP 2 and Invasive cholesteatomas had high MMP 2 compared to latent cholesteatomas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} secondary acquired cholesteatoma {{in patients}} previously treated for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). To focus on misleading symptoms suggesting LCH relapse. PATIENTS: This study involved 3 patients aged 12, 20, and 58 months whose conditions {{were diagnosed with}} LCH. All 3 had involvement of the mastoid and of {{the skin of the}} external ear canal (EAC) at diagnosis. They were treated with steroids and vinblastine. INTERVENTIONS: Serial computed tomographic (CT) scans and clinical follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Exploratory surgery of the mastoid. RESULTS: Otorrhea recurred in all 3 patients at 24, 17, and 26 months, respectively, with difficulties to clinically identify a hole in the posterior part of the EAC. The otorrhea was considered a sign of a new occurrence of LCH, leading to systemic chemotherapy in 2 cases. A CT scan showed a defect in the posterior wall of the EAC and suggested cholesteatomatous invasion of the mastoid (2 true cholesteatomas and 1 precholesteatomatous case). Surgery (canal wall up <b>mastoidectomies)</b> successfully removed the cholesteatoma (bilateral in 2 cases) and reconstructed the bony defect using cartilage. Biopsies ruled out LCH recurrence.

40|$|Background and Objectives：Surgical {{treatment}} of jugular foramen tumors can have significant complications such as facial nerve palsy due to complicated regional anatomy. In this study, we investigated the outcomes and complications of surgical {{approach to the}} jugular foramen tumors. Subjects and Method：Thirteen patients had operations for their tumors around jugular foramen with a mean follow-up period of 52 months. We reviewed their medical records with emphasis on postoperative facial nerve palsy and other low cranial nerve palsies. Results：There were jugular foramen schwannoma (n= 9), glomus ju-gulare (n= 2), meningioma (n= 1) and chondrosarcoma (n= 1). Gross total removal was achieved in 12 patients. Facial nerves were rerouted at genigulate ganglion (long rerouting) or at the second genu (short rerouting). <b>Mastoidectomies</b> were performed with canal wall-up (CWU) fashion or with canal wall-down (CWD) fashion. The mean size of tumor with long rerouting was sig-nificantly larger than that with short rerouting (p= 0. 037).

50|$|Otology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which studies normal and pathological anatomy and physiology of the ear (hearing and vestibular sensory systems and related structures and functions) {{as well as their}} diseases, diagnosis and treatment. Otologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the middle ear and mastoid related to chronic otitis media, such as tympanoplasty, or ear drum surgery, ossiculoplasty, or surgery of the hearing bones, and <b>mastoidectomy.</b> Otology also includes surgical treatment of conductive hearing loss, such as stapedectomy surgery for otosclerosis. Neurotology, a related field of medicine and subspecialty of Otolaryngology, is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanlicular acoustic neuromas.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} a new clinical observation of "tactile dysgeusia," a phenomenon associated with otologic and skull base surgery likely caused by {{injury to the}} chorda tympani nerve (CTN) or the nervus intermedius (NI) with subsequent aberrant cross-innervation with somatosensory fibers in the surgical field. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive case series. SETTING: Tertiary university referral center. METHOD: Eight patients described a sensation of touch-evoked dysgeusia after surgery. Seven patients underwent a variety of middle ear procedures including stapedotomies and <b>mastoidectomies.</b> One patient had a large cerebellopontine angle meningioma excised through a translabyrinthine approach. There were no preoperatively sensory symptoms of any kind. RESULTS: In five of seven patients who had an otologic procedure, the CTN nerve was transected, whereas in the remaining two, the nerve was preserved but stretched. In the meningioma patient, the facial nerve was preserved without clear identification of the NI; the facial nerve function was normal postoperatively. All of the otologic patients experienced symptoms of dysgeusia and sensory alteration triggered by touching {{various parts of the}} outer ear. One also has a secondary trigger in the V 2 dermatome. In the meningioma patient, taste and sensory alteration was induced by stimulating the ipsilateral V 2 and V 3 dermatome. In all patients, the symptom was located in the lateral aspect of the ipsilateral hemitongue. CONCLUSION: Tactile dysgeusia is an unusual complication after otologic and neurotologic procedures. It is likely related to aberrant re-innervation of the special sensory fibers within the CTN nerve or the NI with somatosensory fibers. Postoperative "tactile dysgeusia" may not be so rare; its true incidence could only be ascertained through a more rigorous postoperative assessment...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{present and}} assess a {{surgical}} technique designed {{to minimize the}} known causes of a discharging mastoid cavity. Study Design: A temporal bone dissection to establish the anatomical relationships on which the surgical technique is based. A presentation of the proposed surgical technique and a prospective assessment of the technique in twenty consecutive <b>mastoidectomies.</b> Methods: Five temporal bone dissections were performed to establish {{the relationship between the}} chorda tympani and the facial nerve when these structures are approached from above. The surgical technique is presented and the mastoid cavities of twenty consecutive patients assessed. The assessment included measurement of the facial ridge height, “kidney-shape” of the cavity, size of the cavity, size of the meatus, and state of the tympanic membrane. Results: In the temporal bone dissections the vertical height between the chorda tympani and the facial nerve at 3 / 9 o'clock was a mean of 2. 01 mm. Nineteen of the 20 consecutive mastoid cavities (95 %) performed with the presented technique remained well healed and dry. The mean facial ridge height was 2. 7 mm at 3 / 9 o'clock and 4. 8 mm at 6 o'clock. The kidney-shaped measurement was 1. 45 mm. The mean size of the cavities was 2. 6 mm and 18 of the 20 patients (90 %) had an intact tympanic membrane. The mean largest diameter of the meatus was 10. 1 mm.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV) {{was introduced}} in 2000. The first 7 -valent vaccine {{was followed by a}} 13 -valent vaccine (PCV 13) with the same conjugate, and a 10 -valent vaccine (PCV 10), conjugated to protein D from H. influenzae. The vaccines offer some protection against pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM), and, with PCV 10, possibly also some protection against H. influenzae AOM. PCV 7 {{was introduced in}} Sweden in 2009, but from 2010, Swedish counties were free to use either PCV 13 or PCV 10. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the incidence of AOM-related diagnoses and surgical procedures before and after the introduction of PCV in Sweden, but also to compare the areas using PCV 13 and PCV 10. METHODS:: Data showing the number of AOM diagnoses, ventilation tube insertions, myringotomies, acute mastoiditis cases and <b>mastoidectomies</b> between 2005 and 2014 were extracted from the National Board of Health and Welfare database. Yearly national incidences were calculated, and areas using PCV 13 and PCV 10 were compared. RESULTS:: AOM incidence decreased, both in out-patients (39 %) and hospital admissions (42 %). Ventilation tube insertions decreased by 18 %, and myringotomies by 15 %. The decline in out-patient AOM and ventilation tube insertions was more pronounced in areas that used PCV 10, but geographical differences were large also before vaccine introduction. CONCLUSION:: Otitis media-related diagnoses have decreased in Sweden since the introduction of PCV. Though some decreases were more pronounced in areas where PCV 10 were used, figures should be interpreted with great caution, since considerable geographical differences were obvious also before vaccine introduction...|$|R
