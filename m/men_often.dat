5|$|Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. (Bruce Campbell), {{the son of}} {{the slain}} U.S. Marshal, to track and re-capture Bly (Billy Drago) and his gang. The Westerfield Club's timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson) relays {{instructions}} and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two <b>men</b> <b>often</b> find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions <b>men</b> <b>often</b> attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|The growing African-American {{population}} {{settling in}} the South Side bordered {{a neighborhood of}} Irish Americans existing since the mid-19th century and the two groups competed for jobs and housing. African-American migrants arrived after waves of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; there were competition and tensions in their relationships, too. Ethnic groups were possessive of their neighborhoods, which their young <b>men</b> <b>often</b> patrolled against outsiders. Because of agricultural problems, Southern whites also migrated to the city, about 20,000 by this period. The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding {{as a result of}} a lack of adequate low-cost housing.|$|E

5|$|The {{people of}} Uttar Pradesh dress {{in a variety}} of {{traditional}} and Western styles. Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments—such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men—and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama for men. <b>Men</b> <b>often</b> sport head-gear like topi or pagri. Sherwani is a more formal male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on festive occasions. European-style trousers and shirts are also common among the men.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both <b>men</b> <b>often</b> bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded <b>men</b> <b>often</b> died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these <b>men</b> <b>often</b> stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

25|$|Upper class <b>men</b> <b>often</b> wore a cane as part {{of their}} outfits, {{suspending}} it by a loop from one of their waistcoat buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs. The cane was thus less functional and rather for the sake of fashion.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{history in}} Russia started to become {{important}} in the Czarist era, and concern was shown in the consciousness and writing of Alexander Pushkin. During the Soviet Era, feminism was developed along with ideals of equality, but in practice and in domestic arrangements, <b>men</b> <b>often</b> dominate.|$|E
25|$|Graves' disease {{occurs in}} about 0.5% of people. It occurs about 7.5 times {{more often in}} women than <b>men.</b> <b>Often</b> it starts {{between the ages of}} 40 and 60. It is {{the most common cause of}} {{hyperthyroidism}} in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases).|$|E
25|$|The Irish Brigade {{became one}} of the elite units of the French Army.

25|$|The first {{decision}} {{to be made in}} managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed.

25|$|There {{has also}} been much {{research}} into childhood gender nonconformity and sexual orientation. Gay <b>men</b> <b>often</b> report having been feminine boys and lesbian women often report having been masculine girls. In men, CGN is a strong predictor of sexual orientation in adulthood, but this relationship is not as well understood in women. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia reported more male-typical play behaviours and showed less heterosexual interest.|$|E
25|$|Linen shirts had deep cuffs. Shirt sleeves became fuller {{throughout}} the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a whisk, was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular falling band {{lying on the}} shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and <b>men</b> <b>often</b> grew a large, wide moustache, as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} 'The Black Man' and 'The White Lady' is {{believed}} to be a mythical tale conjured up by smugglers to stop people wandering onto the 'saltings' and finding their smuggled goods. It was said that 'The Black Man' offered a price for your soul, while the 'White Woman' would tempt you to dance with her. <b>Men</b> <b>often</b> spoke of trying to chase away the figures, only to watch them vanish before their eyes.|$|E
