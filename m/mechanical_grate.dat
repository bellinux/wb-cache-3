50|$|The fuel is {{injected}} part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical. Due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 °C in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{research}} {{the impact of the}} structure parameters for <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> on MSW(Municipal Solid Waste) movement characteristics such as transportation speed, average stop time and mixed rate of waste, a new kind of <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> cold experimental device has been designed which can realize the switch between push forward and backward. Many structure parameters can be adjusted including the height of grate, move distance of grate, bed angle, and move speed of the grate. Based on <b>Mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> cold experimental device, studying the impact of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> structure parameters on the characteristics of waste movement is conducive to applying the results of test to the actual MSW grate incinerator. It provides a strong basis for the improvement and optimization of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate</b> furnace in terms of characteristics of Chinese MSW...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{design and}} operation of a fluidized bed combustor requires {{the ability to control}} and mitigate ash-related problems. The main ash-related problem of biomass filing boiler is agglomeration. The fluidized bed boiler with steam capacity of 66 t/h (4 MPa, 440 °C) was started up at the Arkhangelsk Paper-Pi dp-Plant in 2001. This boiler was manufactured by the Russian companies "Energosofin" and "Belenergomash" and installed instead of the existing boiler with <b>mechanical</b> <b>grate.</b> Some constructional elements and steam drum of existing boiler remained unchanged. The primary air fan was installed past the common air fan, which supply part of the air into 24 secondary airports. First operating period shows that the bed material is expanded and then operator should increase the primary air rate, and the boiler efficiency dramatically decreases. Tills paper presents some results of our investigations of fuel, bed and fly ash chemical compositions and other characteristics. Special experiments were carried out to optimize the bed drain flow rate. The influence of secondly air supply improvement on mixing with the main flow and boiler efficiency are given...|$|E
