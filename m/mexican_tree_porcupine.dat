40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report the death of a Boa constrictor amarali after ingestion of a <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine.</b> The animal was donated to the Center for the Study of Venoms and Venomous Animals (CEVAP/UNESP) - and died in captivity. At necropsy, spine-like structures were observed in the stomach serosa and vicinity, and the stomach mucosa showed an intense reddish area, suggesting inflammation. The analysis of the spine-like structure revealed that they were <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine</b> spines. The feeding habits and inexperience of this Boa constrictor amarali in selecting its prey may have been be responsible for its death...|$|R
50|$|Many {{arboreal}} species, such as <b>tree</b> <b>porcupines,</b> chameleons, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails {{to grasp}} branches. In the spider monkey and crested gecko, {{the tip of}} the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provide increased friction.|$|R
50|$|The prehensile-tailed porcupines or coendous (genus Coendou) {{are found}} in Central and South America. Two other {{formerly}} recognized Neotropical <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine</b> genera, Echinoprocta and Sphiggurus, have been subsumed into Coendou, since Sphiggurus was shown by genetic studies to be polyphyletic, while Echinoprocta nested within Coendou.|$|R

5000|$|On 28 September, {{a second}} trailer was {{released}} featuring a -minute edit {{of a song}} called [...] "Get All You Deserve" [...] (the song is 6:17 in length on the album).

50|$|At this point, <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> {{was little}} more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, No-Man, an {{endeavour}} with UK based singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. However, by 1989 he began to consider some of the <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long cassette titled Tarquin's Seaweed Farm under the name of <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree.</b> Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an 8-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 many <b>Mexican</b> <b>tree</b> {{producers}} {{sold their}} crop directly from their production areas, {{though a few}} farmers utilized local retail markets.|$|R

In 2011 the USDA included a more exhaustive list in a report of <b>Mexican</b> <b>tree</b> farming that included: Mexican White Pine (Pinus ayacahuite), Douglas Fir, Mexican Pinyon, Sacred Fir, and the Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis).|$|R

50|$|Trueman {{left the}} music {{industry}} in 2000 and Allen carried on managing <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> and running the Delerium label. By 2002 Delerium had become inactive as the market for new psychedelic and progressive rock bands faded, {{but a couple of}} releases were re-issued including Psychomuzak's album The Extasie (2004) - which was produced by <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree's</b> Steven Wilson - and <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree's</b> Moonloop, which was previously a fan club only album that was reissued in limited quantities on both CD and vinyl.|$|R

50|$|The {{profile of}} <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> had now grown {{to the extent}} that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances. Thus, in December 1993, <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> became a live unit {{featuring}} Steven Wilson on lead vocals/guitar, Colin Edwin on bass, Chris Maitland on drums and Richard Barbieri on keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> has {{influenced}} {{a new generation}} of artists and bands. Polish band Riverside were influenced by and admired <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> at their beginnings, as well as United States' Abigail's Ghost, whose leaders praised In Absentia as the best album they have heard. Other groups that started highly influenced by them are Andy Tillison's Parallel or 90 Degrees, Kingfisher Sky, The Man-Eating Tree, Coshish, For All We Know (a project of Ruud Jolie from Within Temptation), Gandalf's Fist, and DeeExpus, who started after their founder, Andy Ditchfield, went to a <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> concert.|$|R

50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Coendou) contain 16 species. They {{are found}} {{throughout}} tropical South America, with two extending into Mexico. They {{are of a}} lighter build than the ground porcupines, with short, close, many-coloured spines, often mixed with hairs, and prehensile tails. The hind feet have only four toes, owing to {{the suppression of the}} first, in place of which they have a fleshy pad on the inner side of the foot; between this pad and the toes, branches and other objects can be firmly grasped as with a hand. These three genera are often united into a single genus Coendou.|$|R
