40|$|Considering {{the need}} to {{undertake}} pipeline replacement in a cost-effective manner while ensuring the public safety interest, evaluating the performance of pipelines subject to soil loading from landslides is a key concern {{in some of the}} natural gas distribution systems operated by FortisBC Inc. As it is typically uneconomical and impractical to relieve stresses in distribution pipe systems by excavating or instrumenting the pipelines to measure the highly localized strains, undertaking numerical and/or analytical modeling combined with experimentation is a key aspect in attempting to relate the measured ground movement to performance of pipe. For this purpose, capturing the fundamental soil-pipe interaction in small-diameter extensible plastic pipes and undertaking field monitoring to validate the numerical model are critically important. With this background, this paper presents field measurement and numerical modeling undertaken to model the performance of 115 mm diameter <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylen...</b>|$|E

This paper investigates the mechanical properties of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> fibreboard composites material fabricated using recycled rubber and coconut coir. The suitability of using recycled rubber and coconut coir as a raw material and polyurethane as a resin in the manufacturer of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> fibreboard was also studied. The <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> fibreboards were fabricated at prescribed percentages of filler. The performance of composite was evaluated by its mechanical and physical properties. Experimental investigation indicated that the mechanical strength of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> fibreboards such as modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity increased with increasing board hardness. Overall, {{the results showed that}} <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> fibreboard had been produced with acceptable properties, thus providing alternatives to manufacturing and agricultures economic planning. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> {{air travel}} market was studied to {{determine}} the aircraft design and operational requirements. The impact of operational characteristics on the air travel system and the economic viability of the study aircraft were also evaluated. <b>Medium</b> <b>density</b> is {{defined in terms of}} numbers of people transported (20 to 500 passengers per day on round trip routes), and frequency of service (a minumium of two and maximum of eight round trips per day) for 10 regional carriers. The operational characteristics of aircraft best suited to serve the <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> air transportation market are determined and a basepoint aircraft is designed from which tradeoff studies and parametric variations could be conducted. The impact of selected aircraft on the <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> market, economics, and operations is ascertained.

50|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>density</b> {{housing is}} not new. Many {{traditional}} types of housing developed prior to car-based cities were at comparable densities, {{such as the}} terraced, row or courtyard housing found {{in many parts of}} the world. The inner suburbs in many Australian cities and those activity centres developed during the late Victorian suburban boom have examples of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing. Since the 1960s, many Australian states have encouraged urban consolidation policies which have facilitated the construction of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing {{requires}} careful consideration of urban design principles. In some cases, urban consolidation policies have allowed indiscriminate demolition of existing low-density housing across established residential suburbs, {{replacing them with}} various forms of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> dwellings. Because of this, many <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> developments have been controversial in the last 20-30 years because of their perceived negative impacts on the neighbourhood character of established residential areas. Accordingly, {{there has been an}} increasing policy emphasis by state and local governments to regulate the design of new <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> developments, such as the Victorian government's ResCode, released in 2001, and the metropolitan strategy, Melbourne 2030, which seeks to confine such housing to activity centres.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the report is to provide advice to support the policy {{development}} process to make available new housing that is affordable to low and medium income households. It targets <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing {{in the city and}} inner suburbs of Adelaide. The report draws together knowledge relevant to the design and delivery of such housing. Conclusions: Good <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing for the target market is essentially the same as well designed, well-located <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing for the general market. The first policy issue is therefore how to facilitate well-designed, economical, <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing in appropriate locations. The second issue is how to make some of this housing available to low/medium income families. The first is the design issue. The second is the delivery issue. Antony Radford and Thea Sarri...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} exhausted Three Kings Quarry {{in central}} Auckland suburbia {{is currently being}} prepared for housing development. As a suburb within New Zealand’s fastest growing city, housing pressure and intensification policies mean that higher density design will be a key focus of remediation. <b>Medium</b> <b>Density</b> Design is a relatively young model of higher density housing in New Zealand and has developed a strong negative stigma, engendered by the abundance of unresponsive <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> developments which struggle, both physically and visually, to connect with Auckland’s low density suburban culture. Plans to only partially fill the site have been met with opposition by the community as the quarry landscape {{is seen as an}} obstacle for connection within the suburb and unfit for human inhabitation. Because of these negative feelings towards both the quarry and <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> design, locals are anxious any development within the quarry will follow a similar <b>Medium</b> <b>Density</b> housing model that turns its back on its context and community while failing to connect to the Three Kings context. This research argues that by designing with the slope and existing condition of the quarry, <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> design can produce a scheme that meets the desires of the community and builds a unique and relevant identity for Three Kings. This thesis proposes this can be achieved by acknowledging the significance of the industrial landscape and designing with landform features and environmental systems; through community focussed <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> design; and by taking advantage of opportunities of mass housing design on the slope. These issues are tackled on the urban scale through design of a master plan, as well as cluster and dwelling scale design proposals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: On a {{fundamental}} level, the transition temperature (Tg) marks {{the transition from}} a cooperative mobility (T> Tg, rubbery state) to a localized mobility (T <T g, glassy state). Fickian diffusion in polymers is an idealized case of mass transport, corresponding to a free diffusion of permeant without interactions with the molecular conformation of the polymer and then with its structural relaxation. There is a direct relationship between the diffusion and relaxation of the polymer and on whether we place ourselves below (glassy state) or above (rubbery state) of the glass transition temperature Tg, the diffusion mechanisms are very different. There are two types of models to describe the variation of the diffusion coefficient D. In this contribution, we will review the different behaviors of the distribution function of the Tg and show us the Deborah number D-defined as the ratio of characteristic times of diffusion and relaxation, to indicate the nature of dissemination and to apply the model. As a practical example we have studied the case of low <b>density</b> <b>polyethylen...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research into}} the process of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing development and its management by state and local governments. The issue {{is an important one}} considering the contemporary form and structure of Australian cities. For at least thirty years, issues and policies concerning what has been known in Australia as 'urban consolidation' have been hotly debated. While these ideas are frequently linked in State urban policies to the need for higher density housing, the problems and issues pertaining to its actual provision suggest that most likely it {{has more to do with}} market factors than planning policy. A case study of how <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing development has occurred and been managed in an inner/ middle ring Melbourne municipality is used to examine the process of multi-unit development and residential consolidation: what it means for the community, the problems for government in managing the process, and the outcomes. Investigated at local government level, the provision of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing raises important issues concerning the management of sustainable and democratic local communities; yet does so in a context where the pressure of globalisation upon urban economies and city governance (with which <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing provision seems intimately bound) makes this increasingly difficult. Looking beyond traditional debates about appropriate urban form and density and into the process of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing development in an urban municipality, we are quickly moved to consider questions of citizenship, democratic participation and the contemporary roles of planning and local government in the Australian urban context. The question of <b>medium</b> <b>density</b> housing provision and the problems raised in managing its development thus provide a unique means to examine the intersections and relationships between several important themes of relevance to contemporary Australian cities and their governance...|$|R
