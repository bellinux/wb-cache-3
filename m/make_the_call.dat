5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E

AIBN has no legal obligation to investigate any specific road accidents, although it is to be informed of any accidents involving buses and heavy trucks, and accidents in tunnels and those involving dangerous goods. AIBN will then <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> as to whether to investigate the matter, based on the assessment of if an investigation can further road traffic safety.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the railway}} sector {{accident}} investigation {{had been carried}} out by the Norwegian State Railways and its successors, the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian State Railways. Major accidents were thereby investigated by in-house commissions with the potential for conflict of interest, or through ad hoc committees appointed by the government. Similar to marine accidents, it was ultimately a subjective call by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for if a committee was needed.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{boys and}} girls may be {{employed}} to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no adjudicative role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This {{is the case for}} many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is sure that the ball is out.|$|E

At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diệm would comply with their demands. Đông attempted to call on US ambassador Elbridge Durbrow {{to put pressure on}} Diệm. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diệm, maintained his government's position of supporting Diệm, stating [...] "We support this government until it fails". Durbrow later recalled receiving a telephone call from an aide to Diệm who insisted that he call Diệm and tell him to surrender or face a howitzer attack on the palace. [...] Durbrow refused and no attack took place. [...] He consequently learned that the aide was forced to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is on a {{business}} call with the investors {{and members of the}} business venture he is up for. Many distractions from the background <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> difficult. At the end of the day, Jim apologizes, but then hears the person on the phone saying this is not working out. Meanwhile, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) convinces several {{of the men in the}} office to grow mustaches for [...] "Movember". He says he is doing this to support the cure for prostate cancer but is actually using it for a chance to socialize more with the office, to no avail. Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) later shows Erin his mustache, but she finds it repulsive. He shaves it off shortly after that.|$|E
500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the pulse repetition frequency, which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|E
500|$|In its display flight, {{the storm}} petrel gives a call {{consisting}} of eight or more repetitions of a fast ter-CHICK sounds {{ending in a}} trill (rapid alternation of notes). This chattering, staccato call is highly variable in pitch, stress and length. Both sexes <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> which is used as an advertisement for a mate, for pair recognition, and in the nuptial flight. The details of the vocalisation vary geographically, including between the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, and birds recognise calls from their own breeding area. The chatter-call of the Mediterranean subspecies is distinctive. It has the first two notes running into each other, and the final element is sometimes doubled. The storm petrel is usually silent at sea, but sometimes gives the chattering call. A purring song arrr-r-r-r-r-r-r… [...] ending with a sharp chikka is given in the burrow by the male only; it was described by Charles Oldham as [...] "like a fairy being sick". Other vocalisations include a fast wick-wick-wick, sometimes given in flight, and an up-CHERRK alarm which resembles the chatter-call. Chicks give a whistling pee-pee-pee call when being fed, and a faster version of this vocalisation is used by adults and young to signal distress.|$|E

Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E
