40|$|The {{elimination}} tree {{plays an}} important role in many aspects of sparse matrix factorization. The height of the elimination tree presents a rough, but usually effective, measure of the time needed to perform parallel elimination. Finding orderings that produce low elimination trees is therefore important. As the problem of finding <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> elimination tree orderings is NP-hard, it is interesting to concentrate on limited classes of graphs and find <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> elimination trees for these efficiently. In this paper, we use clique trees to find an efficient algorithm for interval graphs which make an important subclass of chordal graphs. We first illustrate this method through an algorithm that finds <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> elimination trees for chordal graphs. This algorithm, although of exponential time complexity, is conceptionally simple and leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for finding <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> elimination trees for interval graphs.

However, public health issues concerning access to water for the burgeoning population and firefighting needs spurred a public works project that would greatly impact the region. A plan for the Croton Aqueduct was finalized in the late 1830s. [...] This was a monumental public works project on a scale previously unseen in the United States. The city's oldest bridge, the High Bridge, was erected between 1837 and 1848 to carry the Croton Aqueduct across the river. The bridge became the most prominent aspect of the aqueduct's course, excepting the fountains it supplied downtown. To accommodate the sloops and ferries sailing the river at the time, the bridge was required to meet certain <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> and widths for its supporting arches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{interference}} created by high voltage lines {{arises from the}} corona effect due to high electric fields (also called surface gradients) {{on the surface of}} the conductors of the line. Com-mon methods for the calculation of electric fields created by power transmission lines assume straight horizontal lines parallel to a flat ground. The influence of the sag due to the line weight is neglected or modelled by introducing an “effective ” height for the horizontal line in between the maximum and the <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of the line. In this work we compare values of the surface fields created by horizontal lines and catenary lines. We find that for pronounced sags there are large differences between values of electric field predicted by the exact calculation and the horizontal line approximation, and a better esti-mate arises from placing the horizontal line near the minimum catenary height...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper had}} {{experimentally}} studied the fluidic behavior and product of micro-lens fabrication that the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 20 % solutions were used. The 5 inch photo mask first patterned the 4 inch glass substrate with variety of circles surrounded by Teflon AF 1601 S (amorphous fluoropolymer), which circular diameters ranged from 50 mm up to 2. 15 mm. Subsequently, {{the solution was}} injected onto circular areas by using simple syringes. Consequently, the micro-lenses with circular shapes, as patterned by the mask, were successfully self-formed. We found that the geometry of final solid lenses, after water solvent completely evaporated, were characterized with one ring-shaped rib located at near 18 % of the diameter line. It {{turned out that the}} maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of lens happened to the tip of the rib and the center of the lens, respectively.

This study analysed the effects of fatigue induced by repeated sprints on the kinematics of 3 -point shooting (3 PS) in young, elite basketball players (U 18 level). 3 D joint angles were calculated at the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of the centre of mass during 3 PS, using inertial measurement units (Biomech system, Xsens Technologies BV, Enschede, The Netherlands). Height, velocity and {{the angle of the}} ball at the time of release were extrapolated from the wrist joint angles. All players performed four 3 PS actions in dynamic conditions before and after a fatigue protocol at 70 % of their maximal exercise capacity. The fatigue protocol consisted of a shuttle test with repeated 20 -m sprints interspersed with sets of 5 jumps. There was no change in the kinematics of 3 PS (p > 0. 05), or the ball release variables (p > 0. 05) following the fatigue protocol. This suggests that elite basketball players are able to cope with physical fatigue while performing coordinated movements such as 3 PS...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} geomorphological and geochronological {{evidence}} for latest glacial and early Holocene megafloods in the Upper Mississippi River valley between Keokuk, Iowa and Hannibal Missouri. We {{have identified a}} series of fluvially cut benches and slackwater sediments that record <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of megafloods that affected {{this part of the}} valley. Radiocarbon dates and crosscutting relationships with regional stratigraphic units document two distinct periods of flooding between 11, 600 and 9, 200 (super 14) C yr B. P. The older flooding episode is of greater magnitude and is represented by a series of low benches cut into older Quaternary sediments and Mississippian bedrock along the western valley margin. Lag deposits consisting of erratic cobbles and boulders rest on these cut surfaces, and are overlain by loess-free alluvium, colluvium or alluvial fan deposits. The younger flooding episode, dated to 9, 600 - 9, 200 (super 14) C yr B. P., is represented by distinctive reddish brown silty clay laminae and beds that occur at elevations lower than that of the modern floodplain in slackwater settings such as distal floodplains and abandoned channels. Both megaflood episodes were produced by drainage of glacial lakes. The oldest episode 2 ̆ 7 s timing suggests that it may be related to drainage of Glacial Lake Agassiz through the southern outlet during the Lockhart Phase. The occurrence of Superior-source reddish brown silty clay sediment indicates that the younger megaflood episode 2 ̆ 7 s source was drainage from Glacial Lake Superior via the St. Croix Valley...|$|E
40|$|To avoid {{unpredictable}} social effects, animals’ behavioural {{priorities are}} almost always tested using individuals housed singly, yet many species kept commercially are social animals housed in groups. Our aim {{was to develop a}} method of investigating environmental preference in group-housed laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, that maximised the external validity of our findings. In a simple test of preference, eight groups of ten hens were given free choice between furnished cages with <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of 38 cm (low) and 45 cm (high). A preference for one cage height over the other would be evident as a shift from a binomial distribution of flock sizes in the two cages. No height preference was found as hens distributed evenly between the two cages more frequently than was expected. This suggests at high stocking densities maximising average inter-individual distance could be a priority over increased cage height. In a second experiment, to investigate the value that hens placed on a change in cage height; a ‘cost’ {{in the form of a}} narrow gap was imposed on movement from a low or high start cage to a high or low target cage, respectively. Cage height did not influence the latency of the first three hens to enter the target cage. However, latencies for subsequent hens were shorter and more hens worked to access a high target cage than a low target cage. We suggest that titrating animals’ willingness to tolerate higher stocking densities against access to a resource could be an effective way to compare responses of group-housed animals to resources that are expected to satisfy the same motivational state...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to create an accurate steady state thermal model of a molten salt receiver prototype with a horizontal divider plate in the molten salt for Concentrated Solar Power on Demand (CSPonD). The purpose of the divider plate is to separate the heated salt on the top from the colder salt on the bottom while allowing some of the salt to pass around the plate. The thermal model used is a one dimensional resistance model which uses bulk temperatures for {{the top and bottom}} layers of salt. An assumption needed to be made to allow the model to be solvable, so it was modeled using two different assumptions, a given energy input and a given top salt bulk temperature. The system was solved for the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> that the divider plate transverse, with the top of the plate being 2 centimeters and 5. 5 centimeters {{from the bottom of the}} receiver. The given energy for the two heights was 1, 598 W for the 2 centimeter height and 1, 512 W for the 5. 5 centimeter height. For the given top temperature for the two heights the temperatures were 367. 2 °C for 2 centimeter height and 360. 0 °C for 5. 5 centimeter height. It was observed that both models showed correlation with the trends in the temperature gradients and heat losses as the tested experiment, varying at a maximum temperature difference of 55 K to a minimum of less than 2 K. The observations show that the assumed temperature models show a closer correlation with the experimental results than the assumed energy model. The experiment, however, was only run for 8000 s, which suggests that it might not have reached steady state making the energy model the better model for steady state analysis. by Jennifer A. Rees.

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Different {{criteria}} {{have been}} described based on height reduction of the total myelographic contrast column and components of it as tests for compression of the spinal cord due to cervical stenotic myelopathy (CSM). Fifty percent height reduction of the dorsal myelographic column (DMC), < 2 mm empiric height of the DMC and a 40 % reduction of the ratio of stenosis calculated based on the height reduction of the entire dural diameter (DD) {{have been described}} as decision criteria for considering the test result positive. The reasons for selecting these decision criteria or their accuracies have rarely been reported. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic criteria based on reduced height of the total myelographic column and components of it for diagnosing extradural spinal cord compression using different decision criteria, and make recommendations for consistent myelographic interpretation in horses suspected of having CSM. METHODS: Four measurements were obtained by 2 readers in a retrospective sample population of 38 horses in which both cervical myelography and histopathological examination of the cervical spinal cord were performed. The prevalence of CSM in the sample was 50 %. At intervertebral sites, the <b>minimum</b> <b>heights</b> of the DD and DMC were measured. At intravertebral sites, the maximum heights of the entire DD and DMC were obtained. Percent height reductions of the DMC and DD were determined as the ratio of minimum intervertebral height to maximum intravertebral height within the next cranial vertebra. Histological examination was used as the gold standard for determining the actual site of spinal cord compression. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic criteria were estimated at each site in neutral and flexed neck positions using several different decision criteria. CONCLUSIONS: At C 6 -C 7, in neutral or flexed neck position and using 20 % reduction of DD, the test was highly sensitive and specific for CSM. At other sites, reduced height of the myelographic column generally was not accurate for diagnosing extradural spinal cord compression. Using 20 % reduction of DD in neutral position at the mid-cervical sites, the test had only low sensitivity and high specificity. Flexion of the neck appeared to increase detection of spinal cord compression in the mid-cervical region, but also substantially increased the frequency of false-positive diagnoses. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: By using the reported sensitivity and specificity estimates, readers may decide on a decision criterion for diagnosis of extradural spinal cord compression due to CSM. However, in planning a surgical correction, it is difficult to define a decision criterion that combines acceptable sensitivity and specificity, especially at the mid-cervical sites. status: publishe...|$|E
