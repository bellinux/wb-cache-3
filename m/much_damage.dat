5|$|Ewiniar {{affected}} {{many areas}} {{due to its}} track and relatively long life, killing at least 40people along the way and leaving <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> in its path.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, with {{epicenter}} just to {{the north}} in Kiholo Bay near Māhukona, caused <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> in the area.|$|E
5|$|After causing <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> to the Spanish {{defenses}} and receiving minor damage, low on coal]and ammunition, Sampson ordered a cease fire {{and returned to}} Havana, Cuba {{and then on to}} Key West, Florida for repairs and supplies.|$|E
50|$|Local water holes, <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> and {{overused}} {{after years}} of cattle use, provide relief from the hot summer days.|$|R
5000|$|... 18th century - a <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> {{ornamental}} seat {{also known}} as White Seat, with a magnificent view north up the River Tamar.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral was <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> by the {{earthquake}} of 1873, which destroyed a considerable {{portion of the}} town, though the campanile stood firm.|$|R
5|$|Dating from 1177 to 1512, Rochester Cathedral has a Norman nave and crypt, and Early English choir. Its most {{remarkable}} {{feature is the}} rare, exuberantly carved Norman portal, which has, unfortunately, suffered <b>much</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Harveys Creek {{is one of}} {{four major}} sources of {{flooding}} in Lake Township. The other three are Pikes Creek, Fades Creek, and Beaver Run. However, the floods of these creeks have not caused <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> since Lake Township is relatively undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|No British {{aircraft}} were encountered and <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> {{was done}} in the area south of the fortress. The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged. In the northern part of Gibraltar, fires broke out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And has {{she been}} keeping school like Patience on a {{monument}} all these years? It doesn't seem to have <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> her damask cheek!' ...|$|R
60|$|GENERAL SUMNER: I {{think they}} have retired from our front; were very <b>much</b> <b>damaged,</b> {{especially}} in their best troops, in the late actions, from superiority of arms.|$|R
25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>damaged</b> in {{this action}} and after {{suffering}} the 1782 Central Atlantic hurricane of 17 September, she sank on 4 October 1782. The privateer Hawke saved 200 of her crew.|$|R
5|$|The Nyethang Drolma Temple {{survived the}} Cultural Revolution without <b>much</b> <b>damage,</b> {{and was able}} to {{preserve}} most of its valuable artifacts, due to the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai {{at the request of the}} government of what is now Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British. After the British were in the hollow way, the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more men. All of the troops were stationed {{too far away from}} one another to do <b>much</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game ends {{in defeat}} if the player crashes, {{runs out of}} fuel, or is shot down by taking too <b>much</b> <b>damage.</b> The player can also eject, but {{can only do so}} safely over Allied territory. The player is victorious if they defeat all enemy forces. During the game, points are awarded and {{displayed}} in the control panel for destroyed enemies and on game end tallied up in a high score table.|$|E
50|$|Iris bulleyana (and Iris chrysographes and Iris wilsonii) {{are very}} {{susceptible}} to the Iris borer moth caterpillars (Macronoctua onusta) {{and they can be}} so <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> that it could be fatal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's the Boy Jim?" [...] growled Gunter, whose temper, {{at no time}} a good one, {{had been}} <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> by the blows he had {{received}} {{in the fall of}} the previous night.|$|R
50|$|Poursuivante had ten men {{killed and}} fifteen wounded, her hull had {{sustained}} several shots and her rigging was <b>much</b> <b>damaged.</b> As Cap-Haïtien lacked {{the resources to}} repair the frigate, Willaumez had to sail her back to France.|$|R
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
50|$|A <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> Celtic cross {{was found}} in the {{stonework}} during restoration and a reconstruction has been placed in the nave. The red paint on the stonework is a reminder of the original brightly painted character of pre-Reformation churches.|$|R
50|$|This {{scene was}} <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> during the Coptic period. Akhenaten is shown {{holding up a}} plate with food offerings. Nefertiti stands behind him either holding up her hands or {{possibly}} offering up flowers or food which {{can no longer be}} seen.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 January 1808 the [...] "armed brig" [...] Charles {{arrived at}} Grimsby <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> and having lost her masts. She had {{captured}} a lugger privateer off the Dogger Bank {{and sent her}} into Yarmouth. In March 1808 Clephane assumed command of [...]|$|R
5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too <b>much</b> <b>damage.</b> The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|Jasper Schuringa, who was {{en route}} to Miami, Florida for a vacation, stopped Abdulmutallab from causing too <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> and {{received}} burn injuries in the process. In a statement, Schuringa, who was in seat 20J on the flight, said {{he was able to}} locate Abdulmutallab, help to extinguish the fire that the explosive had caused, and helped to restrain Abdulmutallab using plastic cuffs. Schuringa lives in Amsterdam, and was born in 1977 in Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles. Schuringa is a graduate of Leiden University, Leiden. He is a film director of low-budget Dutch films for an Amsterdam-based media company, and was the assistant director for National Lampoon's Teed Off Too.|$|E
60|$|This sad {{prospect}} {{made the}} blue eyes fill with sudden tears; {{and the application}} of the dirty fingers added streaks of mud to the red cheeks, which <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> the appearance of the angel, thought it added pathos to the child's reproach.|$|R
50|$|Being <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> and {{weakened}} by the fight themselves, the British ships took some time to take possession of Redoutable, and Lucas had to request urgent assistance to pump water, as four of Redoutables pumps were destroyed and few of her crewmen could man them.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 March 1808 Lougen {{found the}} British brig [...] engaged in escort duty in Norwegian waters. Lougen tried {{over the course}} of several hours to bring about an engagement, and {{eventually}} succeeded, but Childers escaped <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> though her crew did suffer casualties.|$|R
5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned {{too far away to}} do <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> to the fort. With the arrival of the new guns, Montgomery planned to move the emphasis of the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north side, where they would be closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the increased danger. Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, so it is, and {{the boat}} lies where I picked it up, {{but it was too}} heavy to bring into camp without your assistance, boy. And the best of it is that it's not <b>much</b> <b>damaged.</b> Very little repair will make her fit for sea again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the gales we met," [...] {{answered}} the Spaniard, [...] "what of our general cargo was not thrown overboard was <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> by the brine. Since coming into calm weather, I have had several cases of knives and hatchets daily brought up for overhauling and cleaning." ...|$|R
50|$|The ships Aigle and Gloire {{had spotted}} were {{the rest of}} Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves' convoy. On 17 September, the 1782 Central Atlantic {{hurricane}} caught the British. Hector survived, but <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> in her encounter and in the hurricane, she sank on 4 October; the privateer Hawke saved 200 of her crew.|$|R
