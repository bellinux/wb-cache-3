The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the FastBridge - Direct Behavior Rating (FastBridge-DBR), a brief, novel progress <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure,</b> designed to assess student behavioral change in response to a classroom behavioral intervention. Twenty-four elementary teacher-student dyads implemented a daily progress report intervention to promote positive student behavior during pre-specified classroom activities. FastBridge-DBR data were then collected for three target behaviors (i. e., Academic Engagement, Disruptive Behavior, Withdrawal) and compared to Systematic Direct Observation (SDO) data. Five change metrics (i. e., absolute change, percent of change from baseline, improvement rate difference, Tau-U, effect size; Gresham, 2005) were used to examine sensitivity to change. The Usage Rating Profile - Assessment (URP-A) was used to evaluate teacher acceptability of FastBridge-DBR. FastBridge-DBR scores were highly correlated with SDO data, demonstrating evidence of concurrent validity. FastBridge-DBR change metrics were significantly correlated with SDO change metrics. Additionally, while teachers provided high acceptability ratings for FastBridge-DBR, there was a lack of association between teachers' ratings of acceptability and student behavioral change.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, a {{foodborne}} pathogen, {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} major problems in food safety. With strong safety regulations, a <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure</b> is essential for protecting {{the health and safety of}} consumers. Thus, a reliable monitoring method is required. In this study, a rapid assay based on a combination of helicase dependent amplification (HDA) and DNA signal detection via nucleic acid hybridization in blue silver nanoplates (AgNPls) was established. The assay started directly after short term enrichment in terrific broth using cotton ball swapping technique on seafood surface. A HDA amplification of hly gene of L. monocytogenes at 65 °C allowed DNA signals to be increased, whereas the rendered DNA products were detected via nucleic acid hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe in AgNPls solution. The positive specimens induced blue silver nanoplates’ aggregation resulting in pale gray change to colorless, while the negative specimens showed the blue color of non-aggregated nanoplates. The method had a detection limit at 100 copies of L. monocytogenes DNA per 50 g of sample. This method was rapid, simple, did not require laboratory facilities and was suitable for field food safety monitoring...|$|E

The variables encompassed four internal monitoring measures (CEO {{and chairman of the}} board, non-executive directors, audit committee and concentrated ownership) with the remaining two variables being external measures (institutional investors and lenders). An empirical study was conducted based on data involving 420 Malaysian listed companies over a four-year period from 2009 to 2012. A combination of cross-sectional and time-series data was employed in the analysis. An econometric model using panel data regression techniques was employed to analyse performance of the firms using both fixed effects and random effects models. Using return on equity as the dependent variable, it was established that CEO duality (an internal <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure)</b> significantly influences the performance of firms. The study showed that a CEO who is also chairman of the board exerts a positive influence on company earnings. It suggests that CEO duality could increase performance of firms when these CEOs dominate the decision-making process in their companies.

The participants included 255 students between the ages of 18 and 25 from Illinois State University. The majority of the participants were White/European, heterosexual, women. Students were offered the opportunity to receive extra credit for their participation in the study. Participants were asked to fill out a demographic survey, parental <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure,</b> parent-adolescent communication measure, sexual risk taking measure and timing of parent-adolescent sexual discussion measure. The results provided insight into sexual risk taking behaviors. Specifically, adolescents of divorced and single-parent families have a lower age of sexual initiation in comparison to intact families. Also, parental monitoring was correlated with age of sexual initiation and number of sexual partners, suggesting, that more parental monitoring was related to an older age of sexual initiation and a lower number of lifetime partners. Additionally, on-time mother-adolescent sexual communication was associated with a later age of sexual initiation; however, on-time father-adolescent sexual communication was associated with less condom use and less pregnancy prevention...|$|E
40|$|Post-stroke {{rehabilitation}} {{training is}} proven clinically to be essential and effective on helping stroke patients to regain {{part of the}} functionality of their body. In recent years, cost-efficient rehabilitation training programs especially unsupervised training have become a popular research area due {{the increasing number of}} post-stroke hospitalizations and the high healthcare expenditure associated. In order to achieve unsupervised rehabilitation training, a reliable continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure</b> is crucial. This paper proposed a motion classification system based on template matching technique that can constantly identify and record {{the quantity and quality of}} patient&# 039;s rehabilitation exercise as a reference for the professionals to analyze patient&# 039;s recovery progress. It can also integrate features like fall detection to improve safety in unsupervised training environment. In contrast to the conventional motion tracking system which are generally expensive and complicated to operate, the proposed system uses only low-cost non-visual based wireless sensors for acceleration data collection. Since the classification process is based on template matching, there are no additional sensors like gyroscope required for precise reconstruction of patient&# 039;s motion. To test the system performance, a preliminary experiment involving an actual stroke patient has been conducted. Despite the movement performed by the patient was non-standard and inconsistent, the system was still able to identify the predefined exercises from a series of movements and count the number of repetition for each exercise accurately...|$|E

AIM: To examine validation and reliability SQLS-R 4 among patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: The sample consisted of 61 outpatients with schizophrenia attending the Psychiatry Hospital “Skopje”. Inclusion criteria for subject selection were: 1) age more than 18 years, 2) clinically stable (not acutely ill or has not been recently hospitalized at least for the past 3 months). They completed SQLS-R 4 and SF 36 questioners. RESULTS: The internal consistency reliability was satisfactory for both the psychosocial and vitality domains (Cronbach’s α = 0. 928, 0. 83). Most of the items were significantly correlated with own scale score (from 0. 189 to 0. 687). The average of the score for the psychosocial quality life was 39. 9 ± 8. 6 (sometimes), for the cognition and vitality was 26. 5 ± 6. 1 (sometimes) (SQLS-R 4). There was moderate correlation between SF 36 -energy with SQOLS - motivation and energy; SF 36 -mental health correlation with SQOLS-psychosocial.

40|$|Civil {{infrastructures}} {{begin to}} deteriorate {{once they are}} built and used. Detecting the damages in a structure to maintain its safety is a topic that has received considerable attention in the literature in recent years. In vibration-based methods, the first few modes are {{used to assess the}} locations and the amount of damage. However, a small number of the global modes are not sufficient to reliably detect minor damage in the structure. Also, a common limitation of these techniques is that they require a high-fidelity model of the structure to start with, which is usually not available. Recently, guided waves (GW) have been found as an effective and efficient way to detect incipient damages due to its capacity of relatively long propagation range as well as its flexibility in selecting sensitive mode-frequency combinations. In this paper, an integrated structural health monitoring test scheme is developed to detect damages in reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Each beam is loaded at the middle span progressively to damage. During each loading step, acoustic emission (AE) method is used as a passive monitoring method to catch the AE signals caused by the crack opening and propagation. After each loading step, vibration tests and guided wave tests are conducted as a combined active <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure.</b> The modal parameters and wave propagation results are used to derive the damage information. Experimental results show that the integrated method is efficient to detect incipient damages in RC structures. <br /...|$|E

The intervention was provided in 25 minute sessions four to five times per week for five weeks. Students were individually randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 13) or the comparison (n = 14) condition. Students were pre- and post-tested using standardized tests of spelling and writing and a curriculum-based measure of sentence writing (CBM-W). Additionally, students were given a working memory index as a covariate and an oral language subtest as a counterfactual measure. All participants were also given the CBM-W task twice weekly as a progress <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure.</b> Intervention effects were measured using a series of t-tests and a multi-variate analysis of covariane (MANCOVA). Growth on the progress monitoring task was measured using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Results indicated that students in the intervention significantly improved their spelling as a result of the intervention, but this result was attenuated when controlling for working memory. Student-level characteristics that predicted growth were baseline spelling ability and grade level. Students who were younger and poorer spellers to begin with made the most growth on the CBM-W sentence writing task. Includes bibliographical references (pages 102 - 122) ...|$|E
40|$|A key {{indicator}} {{of quality of}} treatment from the patient's perspective is expressed by satisfaction with care. Our aim was to (i) explore satisfaction {{and its relation to}} clinical outcome measures; and (ii) explore the predictive value of satisfaction for the course of outcomes over three years. Data of 654 patients with a non-affective psychosis included in a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study were analyzed. We included 506 males and 148 females {{with a mean age of}} 30. 47 (SD 7. 24) from The Netherlands. Satisfaction was measured with the self-rating Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- 8. A wide range of interviewer-rated (e. g., Positive and Negative Symptom Scale) and self-rated (e. g., World Health Organization Quality of Life); outcomes of low, intermediate and high satisfied patients were compared using ANOVA, Chi(2) or Kruskal-Wallis tests. The predictive value of satisfaction level on clinical outcomes after three years was tested using regression models. Satisfaction levels were low (19. 4 %), intermediate (48. 9 %) or high (31. 7 %). High satisfied patients showed significantly better interviewer-rated outcomes, e. g., less severe psychotic symptoms, and self-rated outcomes, e. g., better quality of life, compared to patients with intermediate or low satisfaction. Higher levels of satisfaction with care at baseline predicted a reduction of positive symptoms three years later (B=-. 09, P-value=. 013). Satisfaction of patients with psychosis is a valuable <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure</b> since high satisfied patients show more favorable outcomes ranging from psychopathological symptoms to quality of life. Further research into explanations of lower levels of satisfaction is commendable in order to improve outcome...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Tracking brain {{states with}} {{electrophysiological}} measurements often relies on short-term averages of extracted features {{and this may}} not adequately capture the variability of brain dynamics. The objective is to assess the hypotheses {{that this can be}} overcome by tracking distributions of linear models using anesthesia data, and that anesthetic brain state tracking performance of linear models is comparable to that of a high performing depth of anesthesia monitoring feature. METHODS: Individuals' brain states are classified by comparing the distribution of linear (Auto-Regressive Moving Average - ARMA) model parameters estimated from electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained with a sliding window to distributions of linear model parameters for each brain state. The method is applied to frontal EEG data from 15 subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia and classified by the observers assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale. Classification of the OAA/S score was performed using distributions of either ARMA parameters or the benchmark feature, Higuchi Fractal Dimension. RESULTS: The highest average testing sensitivity of 59 % (chance sensitivity 17 %) was found for ARMA (2; 1) models and Higuchi Fractal Dimension achieved 52 %, however, no statistical difference was observed. For the same ARMA case, there was no statistical difference if medians are used instead of distributions (sensitivity: 56 %). CONCLUSION: The model-based distribution approach is not necessarily more effective than a median/short-term average approach, however, it performs well compared to a distribution approach based on a high performing anesthesia <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure.</b> SIGNIFICANCE: These techniques hold potential for anesthesia monitoring and may be generally applicable to tracking brain states...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: While the 2011 {{implementation}} of 2 ̆ 2 meaningful use 2 ̆ 2 legislation for certified electronic health records (EHRs) promises to change quality reporting by overcoming data capture issues affecting quality measurement, {{the magnitude of}} this effect is unclear. We compared the measured quality of laboratory monitoring of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) medications based on specifications that (1) include and exclude patients hospitalized in the measurement year and (2) use physician test orders and patient test completion. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Among patients 18 years and older in a large multispecialty group practice utilizing a fully implemented EHR between January 1, 2008, and July 31, 2008, we measured the prevalence of ordering and completion of laboratory tests monitoring HEDIS medications (cardiovascular drugs [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, digoxin, and diuretics] and anticonvulsants [carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproic acid]). Results: Measures excluding hospitalized patients were not statistically significantly different from measures including hospitalized patients, except for digoxin, but this difference was not clinically significant. The prevalence of appropriate monitoring based on test orders typically captured in the EHR was statistically significantly higher than the prevalence based on claims-based test completions for cardiovascular drugs. Conclusions: HEDIS quality metrics based on data typically collected from claims undermeasured quality of medication monitoring compared to EHR data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{usefulness}} of the rating of perceived exertion training load for monitoring changes in several aerobic fitness and neuromuscular performance variables during 9 weeks of soccer training in young professional players. Nineteen male soccer players (20. 2 ± 1. 9 years) belonging to the same reserve team of a Spanish La Liga Club participated in this study. Countermovement jump (CMJ), CMJ arm swing, single leg CMJ, a sprint running test (i. e., 5 m and 15 m times) and an aerobic fitness running test were performed at the start of the pre-season (Test 1) and 9 weeks later (Test 2). During 9 weeks, after each training session and match, players reported their rating of perceived exertion (RPE) separately for respiratory (RPEres) and leg musculature (RPEmus) effort. The training load (TL) was calculated by multiplying the RPE value by the duration in minutes of each training session or match. Accumulated RPEmus, and associated TL, as well as accumulated training volume were negatively correlated with the changes in most physical fitness attributes after 9 weeks of training (r = - 0. 51 to - 0. 64). Present results suggest that a high perception of leg muscular effort associated with training sessions and matches, as well as an excessive accumulation of training volume (time), can impair the improvement in several physical fitness variables believed to be relevant for on-field soccer performance. Therefore, the independent assessment of leg muscular effort to quantify TL can be an interesting additional <b>monitoring</b> <b>measure</b> in soccer training...|$|E
