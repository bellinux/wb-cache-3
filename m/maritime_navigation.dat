5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli <b>maritime</b> <b>navigation</b> in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} electrification, and {{automatic}} lamp changers {{began to make}} lighthouse keepers obsolete.

Improvements in <b>maritime</b> <b>navigation</b> and safety such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) have led to the phasing out of non-automated lighthouses across the world. In Canada, this trend has been stopped and there are still 50 staffed light stations, with 27 on the west coast alone.|$|E

25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN <b>maritime</b> <b>navigation</b> system. The LORAN system was {{intended}} for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|E

[...] The ship, captained by Hisao Ōnishi, headed for Hawaii on a planned 74-day voyage to train high school students who were interested in pursuing careers as fishermen. A total of 35 people were on board Ehime Maru: 20 crewmembers, 13 students, and two teachers.

500|$|In the Mediaeval era, the Vikings used clinker-built {{ships to}} colonize Iceland, Greenland, Canada, and Russia. A compass showing {{magnetic}} north is first attested—in {{the form of}} a [...] "south-pointing spoon"—in the 1st-century Chinese Lunheng. The first evidence of its use in Chinese <b>maritime</b> <b>navigation,</b> however, dates to Zhu Yu's c. 1115 Pingzhou Table Talks. Alexander of Neckham's De naturis rerum, the first European mention of a magnetized needle, dates to 1190 and immediately notes its use among sailors. Latitude (the ship's position ranging from 0° at the equator to 90° north and south) could be determined by inclinometers—including the astrolabe, sextant, and Jacob's staff—measuring the angle between the horizon and heavenly bodies like the sun or moon. Accurately determining longitude (the ship's position east or west of some fixed point) proved much harder.|$|E

MUNS {{is intended to}} be a plug-and-play module to provide obstacle avoidance and path planning capabilities to existing UUV platforms thereby expanding operational capabil-ities in cluttered and littoral environments. MUNS is designed to be flexible and to support a variety of tasks including point-to-point moves, object inspection, contour tracking, and region scanning/searching. The performance of MUNS has been validated through extensive simulation studies...|$|R
