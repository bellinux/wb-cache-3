500|$|In January 1910, Maeda {{took part}} in a wrestling tournament in Mexico City. During the semifinals, Maeda drew with Hjalmar Lundin. This is a {{different}} result than Lundin recalled in his 1937 memoirs. Said Lundin, [...] "Having been accustomed to handling the big Greco-Roman wrestlers with ease, the Jap thought he could do likewise with me, but in the first encounter I got the better of him, after which <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> returned. I had no trouble then in winning the match. It was a surprise to the crowd and a set-back for Koma. He had been the hero all week, but {{as soon as he was}} beaten the fans, true to form, called him a bum." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{applied to}} become a King's Counsel in 1924, since barristers who were also parliamentarians stood a higher chance of getting {{accepted}} than others. He was accepted on 15 April 1924 and sworn in on the same day. His promotion was met with approval from several noted judges, including Frederick Greer, later a Lord Justice of Appeal, who wrote that [...] "unless my judgement is very much astray, you will quickly acquire a leading place in the front row", a feeling which was echoed by other justices including William Finlay, who wrote that [...] "I am confident that you will {{rise to the top}} of the profession, and I shall very greatly rejoice when <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> is justified." [...] In his first year as a King's Counsel Birkett earned £8,600, double what he had taken the previous year as a junior brief.|$|E
60|$|DOLPHIN. I did. I {{was making}} headway. I had--but I don't know why I should bore you with <b>my</b> <b>confidences.</b> Curious {{that one should}} be dumb before intimates and open one's mind to an all but stranger. I must apologise.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia {{answered}} not a word, but, {{as she sat}} {{and looked}} at me with wide-open eyes, I told her what had happened since my companion and I had landed at Racket Island. I omitted only <b>my</b> <b>confidences</b> to Mother Anastasia and Miss Laniston.|$|R

500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. You feel when he is inside the box he hits the target." [...] Away to Southampton, {{it was the other}} signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for me. I have missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|After {{her time}} with her new friends at the retreat, Sarah Savage was optimistic. [...] "I left the retreat with a {{different}} outlook on life, I could feel <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> growing, slowly." [...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview. [...] "For some reason... living in a female role {{has allowed me to}} be more creative." ...|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'll do it," [...] I said to Bob, who had trotted up. I {{often make}} Bob the {{recipient}} of <b>my</b> <b>confidences.</b> He listens appreciatively, and never interrupts. And he never has grievances of his own. If there is one person I dislike, it {{is the man who}} tries to air his grievances when I wish to air mine.|$|R

500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is. For all the ones that think it's all about some ruff shit, talkin' about guns all the time, but no science behind it, we gonna bring it to them like this." [...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built <b>my</b> <b>confidence.</b> I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big." [...] During the sessions, Nas composed the song [...] "Nas Is Like", which he later recorded as a single for his 1999 album I Am….|$|E
2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times when I could have run. Maybe I was worried my speed was going, and that was {{affecting}} <b>my</b> <b>confidence,</b> especially to counterattack." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early February 2017, Issa {{expressed}} {{his support for}} a special prosecutor to look into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia. On 27 February, he walked back his previous comments.

2500|$|After {{a strong}} 1978 season, Coleman {{announced}} in late October 1978 {{that he would}} not return to Toronto and that he intended to become a free agent. He said at the time, [...] "I've regained some of <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> and probably I'm in the best shape I've ever been." [...] Coleman signed with the San Francisco Giants on April 1, 1979. [...] After five relief appearances with the Giants, and despite not allowing an earned run, Coleman was released on April 21, 1979.|$|E
2500|$|He was an {{accomplished}} oboist in his teens, achieving a Grade 8 {{level in the}} ABRSM music examinations and playing in the South Glamorgan Youth Orchestra for several years, but gave it up once acting took up most of his time. He won prizes for his high baritone singing while at school, including one at the National Eisteddfod. He has said, [...] "As a Welshman, I {{grew up in a}} culture of singing and performing with music, and I think it was through this performing that I got <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> as an actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} of the 1979 French Open, Evert and Turnbull had a close match for the first four games, which they tied each other at 2-all. [...] After that Evert sailed to victory of Turnbull by taking the next ten games in 90 degree weather to take the title in just a mere 63 minutes. [...] Evert said of winning her third French title that [...] "this is a good tournament for me to win because I haven't done {{anything}} spectacular this year...it should help to build <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> before Wimbledon although playing on grass will be completely different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to Roe on {{the bench}} grew when President Reagan, who {{supported}} legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied {{that there was any}} litmus test: [...] "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> {{in the fact that the}} one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing in}} the first round of the US Open to Maria Elena Camerin, Safina made three semifinals in the fall – in Luxembourg, the Tier I Moscow and Hasselt. In Moscow, she {{defeated}} world No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, her first victory over a number one player. She also played a key role in Russia's victory against France in the Fed Cup, partnering Elena Dementieva to win the doubles rubber. Speaking in 2008, Safina stated: [...] "that was a great experience in my life [...] it also boosted <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> because I showed I could play well even with the [...] crowd against me." [...] Safina finished the year ranked world No. 20, by far her highest finish.|$|E

2500|$|... "Brute facts", in the {{terminology}} of speech act philosopher John Searle, are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. Natural science {{is the study}} of facts of this kind. [...] "Institutional facts" [...] are fictions accorded factual status within human social institutions. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{the sudden}} {{cancellation}} of her UPN sitcom Moesha, Norwood suffered {{a nervous breakdown}} in November 1999 — the result of her then-hectic and unhealthy lifestyle and a failed relationship {{in which she had}} experienced verbal abuse. Frightened by the idea that a yet-to-be-made third album she {{would not be able to}} live up to the success of her previous albums, Norwood went on a lengthy hiatus to reflect and take some introspective looks. [...] "I needed to rejuvenate, get my creative juices flowing, balance my life with some privacy, to find <b>my</b> <b>confidence,</b> find my love of music again," [...] she told Jet magazine in 2002. In mid-2000, she started refocused herself on her musical career, contributing songs to albums such as Urban Renewal (2001) and the Osmosis Jones soundtrack (2001), which introduced a scratchy, evocative edge to Norwood's voice, now having a deeper and warmer tone with a textured lower register and notably stronger falsetto.|$|E
2500|$|An F-16 was {{successfully}} refueled on 8 July, and a C-17 on 12 July 2016. Once the hardware fix is verified, a KC-46 with the updated boom will complete regression testing on the F-16, followed by refueling demonstrations with the C-17 and A-10 {{to meet the}} final test for Milestone C approval. USAF chief of staff, General David Goldfein, commented [...] "While it took some time, this week's results confirm <b>my</b> <b>confidence</b> the Boeing team will get this figured out. It's reassuring to see the program take this important step toward the production decision in August." [...] On 15 July 2016 the KC-46 successfully refueled an A-10; during a four-hour flight, the KC-46 offloaded 1,500 pounds of fuel at 15,000 feet. [...] "This completed the required air refueling demonstrations needed for the upcoming production milestone decision," [...] said Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey. To date, more than 900 flight test hours have been completed with the five test aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|A posthumous {{volume of}} his memoirs, {{entitled}} <b>My</b> <b>Confidences,</b> appeared in 1896. In The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) William James {{wrote of the}} 'amiable' personality shown in this book: [...] "This is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and graceful state of mind. For myself, I should {{have no objection to}} calling it on the whole a religious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may seem too listless and half-hearted to merit so good a name." [...] Frederick Locker-Lampson: A Character Sketch, which includes a selection of his letters, was composed and edited by his son-in-law, Augustine Birrell in 1920. This gives an interesting idea of his personality and literary connections as well as notes on his book collection.|$|R
