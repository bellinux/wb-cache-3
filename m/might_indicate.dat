5|$|Cirrus Fibratus clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of cirrus cloud. They <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> windy weather, since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Lonchodectids {{are known}} to have had bodily {{proportions}} similar to those of azhdarchoids, and were probably similarly terrestrial. They are noted for rather unusual dentitions, however, and the possible member Prejanopterus possesses a bizarrely curved upper jaw that <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> some specialized lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished stonework, <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that the site was never finished, however the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
30|$|Metastatic brain lesions {{could be}} visualized by 64 Cu-DOTA-{{trastuzumab}} PET {{in all of}} five cases, which <b>might</b> <b>indicated</b> that trastuzumab passes through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The HER 2 specificity of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was demonstrated in one patient by autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, and LC-MS/MS.|$|R
3000|$|... (Martin and White [2005]: 104 – 111). Message 1605 {{demonstrates}} {{the value of}} entertain. The modal auxiliary <b>might</b> <b>indicates</b> the speaker’s assessment of likelihood that the audience may have other possible ideas for the story, and thereby, recognises that its proposition {{is but one of}} a number of alternatives.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{repeating the}} endodontic treatment with improved debridement, or tooth extraction. Antibiotics <b>might</b> be <b>indicated</b> {{to control a}} spreading or systemic infection.|$|R
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, which <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> {{that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence {{is visible in}} other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|Osteoderms (bony plates {{formed in}} the skin) have been found with at least 10 {{titanosaur}} genera. The lack of osteoderms in the nearly complete Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that they are absent in this genus. However, the closely related Alamosaurus {{was found to have}} osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery, in addition to several other closely related titanosaurs, thus raising the possibility that Ophistocoelicaudia had them as well.|$|E
5|$|People may be {{released}} after assessment from hospital or emergency {{room to the}} care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> an emergent condition such as: change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Dalton!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, with {{a sudden}} flush that <b>might</b> have <b>indicated</b> {{pleasure}} or annoyance. Mrs Dotropy, however, did not observe the flush, but continued-- ...|$|R

5|$|Whether the Republican valley was {{abandoned}} after the Omaha attack is not recorded. The invading Omahas had camped on the Platte, undisturbed by the Chauis, {{on their way}} to the Kitkehahkis; this <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that the two Pawnee bands were on bad terms at the time. The power of the Omahas was broken soon thereafter: in about 1801, a smallpox epidemic spread from the Skidis to the Omahas, killing half of the tribe, Blackbird among them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that Mesa Verdean {{subsistence}} hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
25|$|According to Hogben, another {{handicap}} is {{the lack}} of a pure article, which <b>might</b> clearly <b>indicate</b> the nouns. Nevertheless, Peano occasionally suggested that illo (that) and uno (one) might be used as articles.|$|R

25|$|The term Eesti, {{the name}} of the Estonians, occurs first again in Tacitus; however, it <b>might</b> have <b>{{indicate}}d</b> Balts. In Northern Sagas (13th century) the term started to be used to indicate the Estonians.|$|R
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds {{as indicators of}} both fish shoals, underwater banks that <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
50|$|Nail {{clubbing}} is {{not specific}} to {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Therefore, {{in patients with}} COPD with significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) <b>might</b> be <b>indicated.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Antonio (1786) says, [...] "Baeticus ex oppido Lepe, apud Potosi"; hence Barba {{is assumed}} to be of Andalusian origin, from the ancient Roman {{province}} of Baetica. From the words Lepe and Potosi, Lipes in western Bolivia <b>might</b> be <b>indicated.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fossil flowers from the late Cretaceous of North America known as Neusenia tetrasporangi are a close match to Neocinnamomum, and phylogenetic analysis from living plants <b>might</b> also <b>indicate</b> that Neocinnamomum is one of the earliest surviving lineages of the Lauraceae.|$|R
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{specific}} ancestry of Heraclius the Elder, but this has not prevented modern historians from speculating on the matter. Cyril Mango has supported a theory which suggests {{that he was a}} namesake descendant of Heraclius of Edessa, a 5th-century Roman general. A passage from Sebeos's History has been understood to suggest an Arsacid origin of Heraclius the Elder. This theory was strongly supported by Cyril Toumanoff, while considered likely by Alexander Vasiliev and Irfan Shahîd. John of Nikiû and Constantine Manasses seem to consider his son, Heraclius the Younger, to be a Cappadocian, which <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> his place of birth rather than actual ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> about their history.|$|E
5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Estonia" [...] occurs {{first in}} a form of Aestii in the 1st century AD by Tacitus; however, it <b>might</b> have <b>{{indicate}}d</b> Baltic tribes living in the area. In the Northern Sagas (9th century) the term started {{to be used to}} indicate the Estonians.|$|R
40|$|A female patient {{demonstrating a}} {{previously}} not reported constellation of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type III (including autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves' ophthalmopathy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and vitiligo), coeliac disease and sarcoidosis is described. This {{may be a}} random association but <b>might</b> also <b>indicate</b> a common immunological and/or genetic disturbance...|$|R
5000|$|Zero copula is {{the rule}} for third person, as in Hungarian and Russian. That means two nouns, or a noun and an {{adjective}} can be juxtaposed to make a sentence without using any copula. Third person plural <b>might</b> be <b>indicated</b> {{with the use of}} plural suffix [...] "-lar/-ler".|$|R
5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E
5|$|Neither the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle nor Æthelweard's Chronicon makes {{mention of}} Sitric {{in the years}} 921924, i.e. between his {{installation}} as King of Northubmria {{and the death of}} Edward the Elder. However, there are coins in existence which were minted at Lincoln during the period that bear Sitric's name. These are an important piece of evidence since they suggest Sitric ruled a large area south of the Humber, a claim contradicted by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which says that all the 'Danes' in Mercia (i.e. south of the Humber) submitted to Edward in 918. These coins <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> Viking reconquest of a large area in the years 921924, which if it did happen went unremarked upon by the Chronicle. Edward's control of Mercia likely stretched the kingdom's resources to breaking point, allowing Sitric to exploit the ill-will towards Edward that existed among the populace there, with Edward being unable to effectively oppose Sitric. Downham suggests that the silence of the Chronicle might be due to Edward's failing power in the latter years of his reign, and its tendency to only record successes and not failures. His death in 924 is not recorded by a number of important Frankish, Welsh and Irish annals, suggesting a fall in importance and standing from the zenith of his power in 920.|$|E
5|$|Sources are vague, but it {{is likely}} that St. George's Church fell into {{disrepair}} during the early decades of Islamic rule, and that unfavorable circumstances for the Christian population prevented them from rebuilding it. However, it was partially rebuilt with old materials by the Crusaders, who conquered the area in 1099. The Crusaders built a large courtyard building in Jifna. It had a monumental gate with a portcullis, with a large vaulted hall and thick walls of fine masonry. After their defeat to the Ayyubids under Saladin in 1187, the church again fell into ruin. A document dated 1182 with the signature of one Raymundus de Jafenia, <b>might</b> <b>indicate</b> a Christian presence at this time. According to the American biblical scholar Edward Robinson, there are remains of massive walls {{in the center of the}} village, now filled by houses. They were relics of a castle built by the Crusaders. However, the masonry has no characteristics of the Crusader period; rather, the remains display the Arab architectural style of the post-Crusader period, most likely of the 18th century, judging by the dressing of the stones.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} on type of cancer, location of the cancer, age of the person, and whether the cancer is primary or a recurrence. [...] Treatment is also determined by the specific type of cancer. For a small basal-cell cancer in a young person, the treatment with the best cure rate (Mohs surgery or CCPDMA) <b>might</b> be <b>indicated.</b> [...] In {{the case of an}} elderly frail man with multiple complicating medical problems, a difficult to excise basal-cell cancer of the nose might warrant radiation therapy (slightly lower cure rate) or no treatment at all. [...] Topical chemotherapy <b>might</b> be <b>indicated</b> for large superficial basal-cell carcinoma for good cosmetic outcome, whereas it might be inadequate for invasive nodular basal-cell carcinoma or invasive squamous-cell carcinoma.. In general, melanoma is poorly responsive to radiation or chemotherapy.|$|R
30|$|Patients with {{superficial}} high-grade tumors had {{a significantly}} higher proportion of inguinal lymph node metastasis {{compared to patients with}} deep low-grade tumors. On this regard, prophylactic inguinal lymphadenectomy <b>might</b> be <b>indicated</b> in cases of superficial tumors with high-grade histology while in deeply invasive low-grade penile carcinomas a more conservative approach may be considered.|$|R
