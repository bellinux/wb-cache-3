25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the <b>mating</b> <b>surface,</b> progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E

40|$|A pair of {{substantially}} opposed <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are joined}} {{to each other}} and sealed in place by means of an electrically-conductive member which is placed in proximity to the <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The electrically-conductive member has at least one element secured thereto which is positioned to contact the <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and which softens when the electrically-conductive member is heated by passing an electric current therethrough. The softened element conforms to the <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and upon cooling of the softened element the <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> are joined together in an effective seal. Of particular significance is an embodiment of the electrically-conductive member which is a gasket having an electrically-conductive gasket base and a pair of the elements secured to opposite sides of the gasket base. This embodiment is positioned between the opposed <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> to be joined to each other. Also significant is an embodiment of the electrically-conductive member which is an electrically-conductive sleeve having an element secured to its inner surface. This embodiment surrounds cylindrical members the bases of which are the substantially opposed <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> to be joined, and the element on the inner surface of the sleeve contacts the outer surfaces of the cylindrical members...|$|R

5000|$|Valve {{seats are}} often formed by first {{press-fitting}} an approximately cylindrical {{piece of a}} hardened metal alloy, such as Stellite, into a cast depression in a cylinder head above each eventual valve stem position, and then machining a conical-section surface into the valve seat that will mate with a corresponding conical-section of the corresponding valve. Generally two conical-section surfaces, one with a wider cone angle and one with a narrower cone-angle, are machined {{above and below the}} actual <b>mating</b> <b>surface,</b> to form the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> to the proper width (called [...] "narrowing" [...] the seat), and to enable it to be properly located with respect to the (wider) <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> of the valve, so as to provide good sealing and heat transfer, when the valve is closed, and to provide good gas-flow characteristics through the valve, when it is opened.|$|E

Of the coatings evaluated, alumimum bronze with a polyester additive was most effective at reducing wear and minimizing fretting damage to the <b>mating</b> uncoated <b>surface,</b> by means of a self-lubricating film that developed on the fretting surfaces.
