5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} a {{technique}} for building walls using natural raw <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> earth, chalk, lime or gravel.|$|E
5|$|The Past wall is {{designed}} by Taiwanese artist Tsai Ken. He stacked traditional building <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bricks, tiles, stones, wood, and bamboo {{to present the}} Hakka culture of the building.|$|E
5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify {{that they may}} be used on non-porous <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be neutral, lacking any intrinsic colour.|$|E
50|$|A palliasse or tick {{is a large}} bag made of strong, stiff <b>material</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> canvas, linen or sackcloth. This is then {{filled with}} <b>material</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> straw, horsehair, wool or {{feathers}} to make a mattress.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{libraries}} are mixes {{of traditional}} print <b>material</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> books and magazines, as well <b>as</b> electronic based <b>material</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> downloadable audiobooks, electronic journals, e-books, etc. Hybrid libraries {{are the new}} norm in most public and academic libraries.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This {{is reflected in the}} origin of the name, which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E
5|$|As aforementioned, {{while its}} exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often {{believed}} to be a dish created by slaves, made from slave owners’ unwanted food <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> animal innards or fatty cuts. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients {{in order to make the}} dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.|$|E
5|$|Austrian and Czech foreign {{exchange}} reserves were soon seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped back to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.|$|E

5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, {{or when a}} decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{work was}} {{influenced}} by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques {{in the treatment of}} <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E

5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E
5|$|More recently, 87Sr/86Sr ratios {{have also}} been used to {{determine}} the source of ancient archaeological <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> timbers and corn in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations.|$|E
5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic. Other <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E

5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The listed items {{consist of}} <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> wood over clay or to bronze. Often the {{articles}} were decorated {{using a variety}} of artistic techniques like gilding of precious metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl inlay or lacquer. The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines or museums.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of dental {{implants}} {{is to support}} dental prosthetics. Modern dental implants make use of osseointegration, the biologic process where bone fuses tightly {{to the surface of}} specific <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.|$|E

5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
