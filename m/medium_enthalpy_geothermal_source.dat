The purpose of this Master Thesis is to identify and compare different technologies to produce low temperature electricity, according to their profitability and efficiency. Moreover, this Thesis focuses on investigating electricity cycles for further use in geothermal power plant applications. Finally the specific case of Geotermica 1 is studied. Low temperature electricity production cycles have been identified during a literature research. Based on that, the most promising cycles have been analysed in detail. These are the ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle), RORC (Regenerative Organic Rankine Cycle) and the LTD (Low Temperature Differential) Stirling engine. The analysis is carried out in Aspen + and with a modified Schmidt formula for the LTD Stirling engine according to Chen (2003). Starting with set boundaries, each cycle is researched in costume cases while varying the same heat source and sink. The LTD Stirling engine shows the best performance with 18. 2 % system efficiency. The simulated LTD Stirling engine, however, has a temperature limitation of 150 °C and cannot be used above this temperature. For higher temperatures, up to 185 °C, the highest efficiency was obtained with the RORC of 18. 5 %. In the Geotermica case, the LTD Stirling engine did not take part, due to missing economic data in the literature. With the expected well flows of the planned geothermal power station in the south of Italy on the Aeolian Islands and the local weather data, the RORC is most promising. The economic evaluation of the ORC and the RORC show as well, that the RORC is the most profitable, although it is the more expensive one with an investment cost of 10. 2 Mio. € whereas the ORC costs 8. 9 Mio. €. The RORC has an annual income of 6. 3 Mio. € which is roughly 1 Mio. € more than the ORC. Together with the exploration and drilling costs of 30 Mio. €, the payback time is estimated to 6. 4 years. 1 Geotermica is the company who plans to build the analysed geothermal power station in south Italy...|$|R

INTRODUCTION Sedimentary basins in Northwest Europe {{have significant}} potential for low to <b>medium</b> <b>enthalpy,</b> deep <b>geothermal</b> energy resources. These resources are generally assessed using standard seismic exploration techniques to resolve geological structures. However, the electrical resistivity parameter, which can be directly impacted by the presence of a geothermal reservoir is rarely investigated in such context. Therefore, the development of alternative and complementary exploration techniques such as Electromagnetic (EM) techniques may have an important role in reducing the cost and uncertainty associated with geothermal resource assessment...|$|R

40|$|The {{great need}} for cooling {{combined}} with Mexico's large availability of low <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> energy, {{makes it very}} attractive to utilize this resource for cooling using heat driven absorption systems. Mexico posseses large amounts of brine at temperatures which are too low to enable electricity to be generated efficiently and economically. Of the possible non electric uses of low and <b>medium</b> <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> energy are, to provide cold storage facilities for perishable foods and produce ice using the heat driven absorption cooling systems. The main purpose of the work described in the thesis is to obtain experimental data on heat driven absorption cooling systems using geothermal energy {{for the design of}} large scale systems.

30|$|The {{conventional}} geothermal {{power plants}} use the reinjection wells mostly {{to avoid the}} depletion of the geothermal reservoir gathering in the underground of the produced brine. Nevertheless, reinjection operations entail high economic costs and some risks. An alternative is the extraction of the heat without geothermal fluids production, the wellbore heat exchanger. The goal of the present paper is {{the analysis of the}} power production of the wellbore heat exchanger (WBHX) in time and the comparison between two different conversion systems of the thermal energy into electrical: the organic ranking cycle (ORC) plant and the Stirling motor. The selected case study is the oil field of Villafortuna Trecate, a <b>medium</b> <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> resource. The simulation results show a substantial decrease of the wellhead temperature in the first 6  months. After 1  year, the thermal power extracted with the WBHX is greater than 1.3  MW. The design parameters are 20  m 3 /h for the flow rate, outlet temperature 100.38  °C and the inlet temperature is 40  °C. The R-C 318 has been selected as working fluid in the ORC plant: the net electrical power is 121  kW. The air is the working fluid in the Stirling motor: the evaluated net electrical power is 152  kW. The Stirling engine has an efficiency greater than 41  % compared to a system ORC.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLocated on {{the inner}} part of the Variscan Orogen, the Paris Basin has evolved from the Permo-Carboniferous as an intracratonic basin. The usual {{description}} of the sediments in the Paris Basin involves imbricated bowl shaped layers, starting from the Triassic. Due to their discontinuity, depth and complexity the Permian and Carboniferous layers have been commonly left aside. Fortunately, recent studies have been completed to looks specifically at these deeper sedimentary layers. With the development of geothermal energy and the widely use shallow <b>medium</b> <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> resources in the Paris Basin (Dogger) these pre-Mesozoic sediments are {{of a lot of}} interest. In this work, we use a tectonic-heat flow modelling methodology to model the present day thermal structure of the Paris Basin. The modelling takes into account the geometry of the layering and the petrophysical parameters (i. e. thermal conductivity, the radiogenic heat production of the sedimentary layers in relation with their facies). In addition, {{the upper part of the}} basement is closely considered to allow the description of magmatic intrusions that could have a major impact on the present day temperature (i. e. the variation of the radiogenic heat production). To assess the result of our thermal modelling, the obtained temperature is compared to BHT's (Bottom Hole Temperature) and DST's (Drill Stem Test) values when available. As a result of this modelling, we are able to present present-day temperature within the basin as well as in the shallower part of the basement. The aim of this work is identify the sources of the temperature perturbation. The impact of the sediment's thermal conductivity has already been assed on a previous work, in this work the deeper source of perturbation are of great interest (thermal conductivity and heat production of the pre-Mesozoic sedimentary layers, heat production of magmatic intrusion in the basement, and regional faults in the sediments and basement) ...|$|R

An interesting solution to alleviate the energy costs and environmental problems may be represented {{by the use of}} geothermal energy. The aim of this paper, based on measured experimental data, such as the inside greenhouse temperature and the heat pump performance (input and output temperatures of the working fluid, electric consumption), was the evaluation of the suitability of low <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> heat <b>sources</b> for agricultural needs such as greenhouses heating. The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Bari, where a greenhouse was arranged with a heating system connected to a ground-source heat pump (GSHP), which had to cover the thermal energy request. The experimental results of this survey highlight the capability of the <b>geothermal</b> heat <b>source</b> to ensue thermal conditions suitable for cultivation in greenhouses even if the compressor inside the heat pump have operated continuously in a fluctuating state without ever reaching the steady condition. Probably, to increase the performance of the heat pump and then its coefficient of performance within GSHP systems for heating greenhouses, it is important to analyse and maximise the power conductivity of the greenhouse heating system, before to design an expensive borehole ground exchanger. Nevertheless, according to the experimental data obtained, the GSHP systems are effective, efficient and environmental friendly and may be useful to supply the heating energy demand of greenhouses...|$|R

The thermodynamic process of the new method consists of extracting a fraction of hot wellhead geothermal brine for the purpose of superheating saturated steam entering the turbine. Computer programming scripts were developed and optimized based on mathematical proposed models for the different components of the systems. The operating parameters such as separator temperature, geofluid wellhead <b>enthalpy</b> and <b>geothermal</b> <b>source</b> temperature are varied to investigate their effects on both net power output and turbine exhaust quality of the systems. Also, full exergy assessment was performed for the new design. The results of separator temperature optimization revealed that specific net power output of the new design can be boosted up to 8 % and turbine exhaust quality can be diminished up to 50 % as compared to common single flash cycle. In addition, for wells with higher discharge enthalpy, superheating process improve specific net power output even up to 10 %. Finally, it was observed that the overall system exergy efficiency was approximately raised 3 %.   Article History : Received January 5 th 2016; Received in revised form June 25 th 2016; Accepted July 3 rd 2016; Available online How to Cite This Article : Nazari, N. and Porkhial, S.

40|$|AbstractTo improve {{knowledge}} of the thermal state of medium to low-enthalpy thermal systems hosted in carbonate-evaporite rocks, a mineral-solution equilibrium model was compared to other theoretical geothermometers. We use the GeoT code, which uses as input the chemical composition of water and saturation indices of minerals to calculate water-rock equilibrium over a temperature range of interest. The calculations were applied to the <b>medium</b> and low <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> systems in the Tyrrhenian-Apennine area (central Italy). The lithology consists of a Paleozoic metamorphic basement, overlain by Mesozoic carbonate–evaporite- and Oligocene–Middle Miocene flysch formations, and Quaternary volcanic complexes associated with crustal extension. A regional aquifer is hosted in the carbonate-evaporite formations, and smaller aquifers are hosted in the volcanic rocks. Reservoir temperatures were calculated based on the chemical composition of springs and wells in Central Italy (sampled previously), and in the Cimino-Vicano hydrothermal system (sampled in 2012). Chalcedony and quartz geothermometers provide realistic temperatures. The sensitivity of the model is tested for CO 2 degassing and input minerals. The results of optimized GeoT simulations show that all the samples are affected by degassing during their rise {{to the surface and}} that for computing a realistic reservoir temperature it is necessary to consider the principal minerals of the geothermal reservoir (particularly gypsum, quartz, dolomite, aragonite and calcite). The equilibrium temperatures range from 48 - 115 °C. The statistical approach of “best clustering minerals” solves the problems related to cation or single component geothermometers. Multicomponent geothermometry coupled with optimization provides a reliable approach to reconstruct fluid composition at depth and estimate reservoir temperatures...|$|R

Many energetic analysis and impact assessments have been made, which have demonstrated the convenience, respect to traditional HVAC systems, of solutions such as solar thermal or low <b>enthalpy</b> <b>geothermal</b> systems in terms of: energy consumption reduction, renewable energy use increase and emissions decrease. However, the several analysis made, up to date, only have considered the operation period of such systems, and consequently the comparison has been made only in terms of energy vectors used, omitting materials, components and processes.
