5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.|$|E
5|$|Recipients {{consider}} the Golden Film {{to be an}} award given to films that are a success. Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to be such a success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been forced to abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised {{and were able to}} provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E

5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E

5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. That cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents {{had already been}} issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E

25|$|Walter Rodney {{argued that}} the export of so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been a {{demographic}} disaster which left Africa permanently disadvantaged {{when compared to other}} parts of the world, and it largely explains the continent's continued poverty. He presented numbers showing that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while those of Europe and Asia grew dramatically. According to Rodney, all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving, and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.|$|E

25|$|In 1744 {{there was}} a riot in Puebla over a minor {{religious}} point. The viceroy, in order to dignify {{his visit to the}} bishop, had ordered the bells rung.

When that turned out not to be the case, they rioted. The viceroy ordered the troops of the garrison to suppress the riot, and there were injuries. The viceroy was criticized for this decision.|$|E
25|$|When the {{earthquake}} hit, the third {{game of the}} 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed {{to take into account}} the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after {{the earthquake}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} the Turco-Persian world in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries was tested by invading armies of inland Asia. The Mongols under Genghis Khan (1220–58) and Timur (Tamerlane, 1336-1405) {{had the effect of}} {{stimulating}} development of Persianate culture of Central and West Asia, because of the new concentrations of specialists of high culture created by the invasions, for <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> to seek refuge in few safe havens, primarily India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled and cross-fertilized, and because the broad peace secured by the huge imperial systems established by the Il-Khans (in the thirteenth century) and Timurids (in the fifteenth century), when travel was safe, and scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate high culture. Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as Chaghatai (today called Uzbek; of Turkic Qarluq origin).|$|E
