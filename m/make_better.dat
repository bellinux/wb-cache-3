By now, it was well into October, and the Donner {{families}} split off to <b>make</b> <b>better</b> time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000 the {{chairman}} considered moving {{the club to}} Maine Road, the former home of rivals Manchester City. The potential move was unpopular with supporters, and protests were staged after {{it was suggested that}} the club would change its name to Man-Stock County after the move. Ultimately Manchester City Council decreed that Sale Sharks would <b>make</b> <b>better</b> tenants. Maine Road has since been demolished {{to make way for a}} housing estate and Edgeley Park was then shared with Sale whose Parent Company Cheshire Sports owned the ground.|$|E
5|$|Starting with WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, a General Manager mode (or GM Mode for short) was introduced. It {{allowed the}} player {{to act as}} the General Manager of the Raw or Smackdown brands (or ECW brand in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008). After {{choosing}} a brand, and selecting {{to participate in the}} WWE Draft, or using a default roster, you then start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstar and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. You must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to <b>make</b> <b>better</b> matches than your rival brand. At {{the end of the year}} at WrestleMania, Vince McMahon will give The General Manager of the Year award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.|$|E

5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to <b>make</b> <b>better</b> extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were craft {{that had no}} ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down gangways. That they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, {{but they were all}} that was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since that had not been done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they veered off to the left, adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and <b>make</b> <b>better</b> landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to <b>make</b> <b>better</b> use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of learning models on mathematics achievement viewed from students 2 ̆ 7 AQ. The learning models compared were Jigsaw cooperative learning, TAI cooperative learning, and direct learning. The type of {{this research}} was quasi-experimental research. Population was all of state Junior High School students in Karanganyar Regency on academic year 2015 / 2016. Samples for group experiment 1 (Jigsaw cooperative learning model) were 98 students, group experiment 2 (TAI cooperative learning model) were 99 students, and control class (direct learning model) were 98 students. The data were collected using documentary method, AQ questionnaire, and mathematics learning achievement test. Data analysis technique used two-ways analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The conclusion of this research as follows: (1) The Jigsaw cooperative learning model <b>makes</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than TAI cooperative learning model and direct learning model, while TAI cooperative learning model <b>makes</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than direct learning, (2) Climber students get better mathematics learning achievement than students Camper students and Quitter students, while Camper students get better mathematics learning achievement than Quitter students, (3) for every learning model, Climber students get better mathematics learning achievement than Camper students and Quitter students, while Camper students get better mathematics learning achievement than Quitter students, (4) for every categories, Jigsaw cooperative learning model <b>makes</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than TAI cooperative learning model and direct learning model, while TAI cooperative learning model <b>makes</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than direct learning model...|$|R
