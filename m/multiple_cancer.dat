2500|$|Another (agnostic) way {{to analyze}} the {{observed}} mutational spectra and DNA sequence context of mutations in tumors involves pooling all mutations of different types and contexts from cancer samples into a discrete distribution. If <b>multiple</b> <b>cancer</b> samples are available, their context-dependent mutations can be represented {{in the form of}} a nonnegative matrix. This matrix can be further decomposed into components (mutational signatures) which ideally should describe individual mutagenic factors. Several computational methods have been proposed for solving this decomposition problem. The first implementation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method is available in Sanger Institute Mutational Signature Framework {{in the form of a}} MATLAB package. On the other hand, if mutations from a single tumor sample are only available, the DeconstructSigs R package and [...] may provide the identification of contributions of different mutational signatures for a single tumor sample. In addition, MutaGene server provides mutagen or cancer-specific mutational background models and signatures that can be applied to calculate expected DNA and protein site mutability to decouple relative contributions of mutagenesis and selection in carcinogenesis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Little {{is known}} about the genetic {{alterations}} in <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> of the gastrointestinal tract. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is frequently observed in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal <b>cancer</b> (HNPCC), and <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> is a feature of this syndrome.  AIMS—To identify MSI incidence, target gene mutation, and mismatch repair (MMR) protein status in patients with <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> of the gastrointestinal tract.  SUBJECTS—Fifty seven cancers from 22  Japanese patients with <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> of the stomach, duodenum, colon, and rectum.  METHODS—MSI was examined at 5 - 7 microsatellite loci. Mutation analysis for TGFβRII, IGFIIR, and BAX was performed in cancers with MSI. MMR protein status was examined by immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody against hMSH 2 and hMLH 1.  RESULTS—MSI was observed in 16  of 22  patients (73 %) and in 29  of 57  lesions (51 %). High frequency MSI (MSI-H) was found often in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>cancers</b> in the same organ (p= 0. 042), especially in <b>multiple</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> patients (p= 0. 038). In contrast, patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>cancers</b> in different organs had a tendency to show low frequency MSI (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) phenotype. Both target gene mutation and decreased expression of MMR protein were found only in seven lesions of three patients with MSI at more than four microsatellite loci.  CONCLUSIONS—These results suggest that genetic instability may {{play an important role in}} the development of <b>multiple</b> gastrointestinal <b>cancers</b> but there may be different genetic alterations between <b>multiple</b> gastrointestinal <b>cancers</b> of the same and different organs.    Keywords: microsatellite instability; multiple primary cancer; hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{incidence}} of colorectal cancer is increasing {{due to a}} westernized dietary lifestyle, and improvements in treatment and diagnostic tools have resulted in more patients being confirmed of having <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers.</b> How-ever, studies regarding <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> are insufficient. In this study, the clinical aspects of patients with primary <b>multiple</b> <b>cancers,</b> including colorectal cancers, were investigated, {{and the results were}} compared to those of patients with primary colorectal cancer only. Methods: Seven hundred eighteen patients who received surgery for colorectal cancer between March 2003 and Septem-ber 2012 in CHA Medical Center were enrolled. A retrograde cohort was done for comparison of the two groups: those with and those without <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancer.</b> The analysis was done according to sex, age, tumor location, tumor size, metastatic regional lymph-node number, vascular/lymphatic microinvasion, staging, tumor markers, microsatellite insta-bility, and C/T subgroup of polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Results: Of the 718 subjects, 33 (4. 6 %) had multiple primary cancers: 12 (36. 4 %) synchronous and 21 (63. 6 %) metachro-nous. The malignancy most frequently accompanying colorectal cancer was gastric cancer, followed by thyroid, prostate, and esophageal malignancies in that order. In the comparison between groups, mean age, tumor location, and microsatel-lite instability showed statistically significant differences; others parameters did not. Conclusion: The {{incidence of}} <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers,</b> including colorectal cancer, is increasing. Therefore, defining the characteristics of patients with <b>multiple</b> primary <b>cancers</b> is crucial, and those characteristics need to be acknowledged in the follow-up of colorectal cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|Statistical network {{modeling}} techniques are increasingly important tools to analyze cancer genomics data. However, current tools and resources are {{not designed to}} work across multiple diagnoses and technical platforms, thus limiting their applicability to comprehensive pan-cancer datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To address this, we describe a new data driven modeling method, based on generalized Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection (SICS). The method integrates genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional data from <b>multiple</b> <b>cancers,</b> to define links that are present in <b>multiple</b> <b>cancers,</b> a subset of cancers, or a single cancer. It is shown to be statistically robust and effective at detecting direct pathway links in data from TCGA.

To evaluate {{the performance of the}} method, we constructed a model for eight TCGA cancers, using data from 3900 patients.
