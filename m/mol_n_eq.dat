We measured denitrification rates in six estuaries of the northern Baltic Sea. Four of them were river mouths in the Bothnian Bay (northern Gulf of Bothnia), and two were estuary bays, one in the Archipelago Sea (southern Gulf of Bothnia) and the other in the Gulf of Finland. Denitrification rates in the four river mouths varied between 330 and 905 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1). The estuary bays at the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia had denitrification rates from 90 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) to 910 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) and from 230 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) to 320 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1), respectively. Denitrification removed 3. 6 - 9. 0 % of the total nitrogen loading in the river mouths and in the estuary bay in the Gulf of Finland, where the residence times were short.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the activity, abundance, and diversity of AOA and AOB in surface oxic sediments of a highly nutrified estuary that exhibits gradients of salinity and ammonium. AOB and AOA communities were investigated by measuring ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene abundance and nitrification potentials both spatially and temporally. Nitrification potentials differed along the estuary and over time, with the greatest nitrification potentials occurring mid-estuary (8. 2 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> grams dry weight [gdw](- 1) day(- 1) in June, increasing to 37. 4 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> gdw(- 1) day(- 1) in January).

40|$|Geochemical {{estimates}} of N 2 fixation in the North Atlantic often {{serve as a}} foundation for estimating global marine diazotrophy. Yet despite being well-studied, estimations of nitrogen fixation rates in this basin vary widely. Here we investigate the variability in published {{estimates of}} excess nitrogen accumulation rates in the main thermocline of the subtropical North Atlantic, testing the assumptions and choices made in the analyses. Employing one of these previously described methods, modified here with improved estimates of excess N spatial gradients and ventilation rates of the main thermocline, we determine a total excess N accumulation rate of 7. 8 ± 1. 7 × 10 ^ 11 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr- 1; 1. Contributions to excess N development include atmospheric deposition of high N:P nutrients (adding excess N at a rate of 3. 0 ± 0. 9 × 1011 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr- 1; 1 for ∼ 38 % of the total), high N:P dissolved organic matter advected into and mineralized in the main thermocline (adding excess N at 2. 2 ± 1. 1 × 1011 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr- 1; 1 for ∼ 28 % of the total), and, calculated by mass balance of the excess N field, N 2 fixation (adding excess N at 2. 6 ± 2. 2 × 1011 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr− 1 for ∼ 33 % of the total). Assuming an N:P of 40 and this rate of excess N accumulation due to the process, N 2 fixation in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre is estimated at ∼ 4 × 1011 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr− 1. This relatively low rate of N 2 fixation suggests that i) the rate of N 2 fixation in the North Atlantic is greatly overestimated in some previous analyses, ii) the main thermocline is not the primary repository of N fixed by diazotrophs, and/or iii) the N:P ratio of exported diazotrophic organic matter is much lower than generally assumed.

40|$|As {{regions of}} high primary {{production}} and being often associated to Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs), Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) represent key regions for the oceanic nitrogen (N) cycle. Indeed, by exporting the Organic Matter (OM) and nutrients {{produced in the}} coastal region to the open ocean, EBUS {{can play an important}} role in sustaining primary production in subtropical gyres. Losses of fixed inorganic N, through denitrification and anammox processes and through nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to the atmosphere, take place in oxygen depleted environments such as EBUS, and alleviate the role of these regions as a source of N. In the present study, we developed a 3 -D coupled physical/biogeochemical (ROMS/BioBUS) model for investigating the full N budget in the Namibian sub-system of the Benguela Upwelling System (BUS). The different state variables of a climatological experiment have been compared to different data sets (satellite and in situ observations) and show that the model is able to represent this biogeochemical oceanic region. The N transfer is investigated in the Namibian upwelling system using this coupled model, especially in the Walvis Bay area between 22 ° S and 24 ° S where the OMZ is well developed (O 2 2 l − 1). The upwelling process advects 24. 2 × 10 10 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1 of nitrate enriched waters over the first 100 m over the slope and over the continental shelf. The meridional advection by the alongshore Benguela current brings also nutrient-rich waters with 21. 1 × 10 10 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1. 10. 5 × 10 10 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1 of OM are exported outside of the continental shelf (between 0 and 100 -m depth). 32. 4 % and 18. 1 % of this OM are exported by advection in the form of Dissolved and Particulate Organic Matters (DOM and POM), respectively, however vertical sinking of POM represents the main contributor (49. 5 %) to OM export outside of the first 100 -m depth of the water column on the continental shelf. The continental slope also represents a net N export (11. 1 × 10 10 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1) between 0 and 100 -m depth: advection processes export 14. 4 % of DOM and 1. 8 % of POM, and vertical sinking of POM contributes to 83. 8 %. Between 100 and 600 -m depth, water column denitrification and anammox constitute a fixed inorganic N loss of 2. 2 × 10 8 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1 on the continental shelf and slope, which will not significantly influence the N transfer from the coast to the open ocean. At the bottom, an important quantity of OM is sequestrated in the upper sediments of the Walvis Bay area. 78. 8 % of POM vertical sinking at 100 -m depth is sequestrated on the shelf sediment. Only 14 % of POM vertical sinking reaches the sediment on the slope without being remineralized. From our estimation, the Walvis Bay area (0 – 100 m), can be a substantial N source (28. 7 × 10 10 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr − 1) for the eastern part of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. Assuming the same area for the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre as the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, this estimation is equivalent to 3. 7 × 10 − 2 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m − 2 yr − 1 for the Walvis Bay area, and 0. 38 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m − 2 yr − 1 by extrapolating for the entire Benguela upwelling system. This last estimation is of the same order as other possible N sources sustaining primary production in the subtropical gyres. The continental shelf off Walvis Bay area does not represent more than 1. 2 % of the world's major eastern boundary regions and 0. 006 % of the global ocean, its estimated N 2 O emission (2. 9 × 10 8 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> 2 O yr − 1), using a parameterization based on oxygen consumption, contributes to 4 % of the emissions in the eastern boundary regions, and represents 0. 2 % of global ocean N 2 O emission.

On the coastal side of the Kuroshio jet close to the shelf edge, strong vertical diffusivity K-rho was observed. The half-day mean K-rho at the top nitracline was 3. 9 x 10 (- 5) m(2) s(- 1). Consequently, a higher turbulent upward nitrate flux of 445 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) across the nitracline was observed than that of 82 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) off the shelf near the Kuroshio jet and 146 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) on the slope at the outer side of the Kuroshio jet. This high upward flux supported the highest rates of primary production (27. 3 mmol C cm(- 2) d(- 1)) and nitrate assimilation (764 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1)), and the contribution of the upward nitrate flux to new nitrogen was 5. 7 times higher than that of N- 2 fixation. In contrast, N- 2 fixation was a major new nitrogen source at stations off the shelf, where the upward nitrate flux was less evident due to less vertical diffusivity and weaker vertical nitrate gradients than near the shelf break in the Kuroshio jet. These observations demonstrate that new nitrogen sources were highly variable according to relative locations at the shelf edge and Kuroshio jet in the East China Sea and the adjacent waters during summer.

40|$|International audienceEastern {{boundary}} upwelling systems (EBUS) are {{regions of}} high primary production {{often associated with}} oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). They represent key regions for the oceanic nitrogen (N) cycle. By exporting organic matter (OM) and nutrients produced in the coastal region to the open ocean, EBUS {{can play an important}} role in sustaining primary production in subtropical gyres. However, losses of fixed inorganic N through denitrification and anammox processes take place in oxygen depleted environments such as EBUS, and can potentially mitigate the role of these regions as a source of N to the open ocean. EBUS can also represent a considerable source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to the atmosphere, affecting the atmospheric budget of N 2 O. In this paper a 3 -D coupled physical/biogeochemical model (ROMS/BioEBUS) is used to investigate the N budget in the Namibian upwelling system. The main processes linked to EBUS and associated OMZs are taken into account. The study focuses on the northern part of the Benguela upwelling system (BUS), especially the Walvis Bay area (between 22 ° S and 24 ° S) where the OMZ is well developed. Fluxes of N off the Walvis Bay area are estimated in order to understand and quantify (1) the total N offshore export from the upwelling area, representing a possible N source that sustains primary production in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre; (2) export production and subsequent losses of fixed N via denitrification and anammox under suboxic conditions (O 2 < 25 mmol O 2 m− 3); and (3) the N 2 O emission to the atmosphere in the upwelling area. In the mixed layer, the total N offshore export is estimated as 8. 5 ± 3. 9 × 1010 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr− 1 at 10 ° E off the Walvis Bay area, with a mesoscale contribution of 20 %. Extrapolated to the whole BUS, the coastal N source for the subtropical gyre corresponds to 0. 1 ± 0. 04 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2 yr− 1. This N flux represents a major source of N for the gyre compared with other N sources, and contributes 28 % of the new primary production estimated for the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. Export production (16. 9 ± 1. 3 × 1010 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> yr− 1) helps to maintain an OMZ off Namibia in which coupled nitrification, denitrification and anammox processes lead to losses of fixed N and N 2 O production.

Surface N- 2 fixation rate ranged between 0. 1 nmol N L- 1 d(- 1) and 5. 6 nmol N L- 1 d(- 1) (average 1. 0 nmol N L- 1 d(- 1), n= 50) under nonbloom conditions.

Our results indicate that N- 2 fixation is unlikely limited by Fe availability in the NWSCS continental waters, instead, the coastal upwelling-induced combined effects of physical and biological processes {{may have played a}} decisive role. With the upwelled cold, dFe-rich, nutrient-replete waters, nondiazotrophic phytoplankton growth would be preferentially enhanced while N- 2 fixation was hindered due to relative deficiency of phosphate caused by massive phytoplankton utilization in the coastal upwelling. By comparison, N- 2 fixation was notably elevated along with decreased PP in the offshore waters, probably due to a shift from P-deficiency to N-deficiency. Consistently, the contribution of N- 2 fixation to PP (0. 01 - 2. 52 %) also increased toward the open waters. As a significant external N source, summertime N- 2 fixation is estimated to contribute a flux of 1. 4 Gmol N to this area under nonbloom conditions.

These data indicate that excess nitrate development is largely confined to depths of ? 150 – 400 m in the region of 15 – 25 °N by 25 – 75 °W, an area considerably smaller than that employed by Gruber and Sarmiento [Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 11 (1997) 235] (10 – 50 °N by 10 – 90 °W) to estimate rates of nitrogen fixation in the North Atlantic.

An accurate assessment of the region over which excess nitrate accumulates is critical to the estimate of nitrogen fixation, but remains prone to large uncertainty because of the gaps in spatial coverage.

Three {{new methods of}} their estimation from spring or early summer observations are described and evaluated. The methods make use of a priori knowledge of the vertical distribution of oxygen saturation and empirical relationships between nutrient concentrations and oxygen saturation. A south–north increase in surface water winter nutrient concentration is observed. Winter nitrate concentrations range from very low levels of about 0. 5 μmol dm− 3 at 33 °N to about 13. 5 μmol dm− 3 at 60 °N. Previous estimates of winter nitrate concentrations have been overestimates by up to 50 %. At the Biotrans Site (47 °N, 20 °W), a typical station in the temperate Northeast Atlantic, a mean winter nitrate concentration of 8 μmol dm− 3 is estimated, compared to recently published values between 11 and 12. 5 μmol dm− 3. It is shown {{that most of the}} difference is due to a contribution of remineralised nitrate that had not been recognized in previous winter nutrient estimates. Mesoscale variation of wintertime nitrate concentrations at Biotrans are moderate (less than ± 15 % of the regional mean value of about 8 μmol dm− 3). Interannual variation of the regional mean is small, too. In the available dataset, there was only 1 year with a significantly lower regional mean winter nitrate concentration (7 μmol dm− 3), presumably due to restricted deep mixing during an atypically warm winter. The significance of winter nitrate estimates for the assessment of spring-bloom new production and the interpretation of bloom dynamics is evaluated. Applying estimates of wintertime nitrate concentrations of this study, it is found that pre-bloom new production (0. 275 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2) at Biotrans almost equals spring-bloom new production (0. 3 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2). Using previous estimates of wintertime nitrate yields unrealistically high estimates of pre-bloom new production (1. 21 – 1. 79 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2) which are inconsistent with observed levels of primary production and the seasonal development of biomass...|$|R
40|$|Present {{and future}} levels of primary {{production}} (PP) in the Arctic Ocean (AO) depend on nutrient inputs to the photic zone via vertical mixing, upwelling and external sources. In this regard, {{the importance of}} horizontal river supply relative to oceanic processes is poorly constrained at the pan-Arctic scale. We compiled extensive historical (1954 – 2012) data on discharge and nutrient concentrations to estimate fluxes of nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), silicate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate organic carbon (POC) from 9 large Arctic rivers and assess their potential impact on the biogeochemistry of shelf waters. Several key points can be emphasized from this analysis. The contribution of riverine nitrate to new PP (PP new) is very small at the regional scale (9 <b>mol</b> <b>N)</b> may exceed the combined riverine supply of nitrate and ammonium (3. 4 × 10 9 <b>mol</b> <b>N).</b> Nevertheless, overall nitrogen limitation of AO phytoplankton is expected to persist even when projected increases of riverine DON and nitrate supply are taken into account. This analysis underscores the need to better contrast oceanic nutrient supply processes with the composition and fate of changing riverine nutrient deliveries in future scenarios of plankton community structure, function and production in the coastal AO...|$|R

To enable an {{accurate}} estimate of total excess ni-trogen (N) in the North Atlantic, a new tracer TNxs is de-fined, {{which includes the}} contribution of organic nutrients to the assessment of N:P stoichiometric anomalies. We mea-sured the spatial distribution of TNxs within the subtropical North Atlantic using data from a trans-Atlantic section across 24. 5 ◦ N occupied in 2004. We then employ three different approaches to infer rates of total excess nitrogen accumula-tion using pCFC- 12 derived ventilation ages (a TNxs verti-cal integration, a one end-member and a two-end member mixing model). Despite some variability among the differ-ent methods the dissolved organic nutrient fraction always contributes to {{about half of the}} TNxs accumulation, which is in the order of 9. 38 ± 4. 18 × 1011 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> y− 1.

Uptake rates of ammonium and nitrate ranged from 0. 005 to 1. 56 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> l(- 1) h(- 1) and 0. 00025 to 0. 25 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> l(- 1) h(- 1), respectively, and differed significantly between and within estuaries. Analysis of nitrogen uptake using the relative preferential index (RPI) indicated ammonium to be the preferred substrate. The turnover times of particulate nitrogen (0. 7 to 31 d) and dissolved ammonium (0. 1 to 27 d) were similar to or shorter than estuarine-water residence times, whereas turnover times of dissolved nitrate (19 to 2160 d) were longer than residence times. Assimilation of nitrate {{in the water column}} of estuaries consequently does not influence its distribution, and most nitrate entering or produced in estuaries flushes through unless significant denitrification and/or burial in the sediment occur. As ammonium and particulate nitrogen are efficiently recycled, most allochthonous organic matter is extensively microbially modified before export, burial, or consumption by higher trophic levels.

40|$|Microphytobenthos and macroalgal mats are {{simultaneously}} present in eutrophic lagoons {{and are expected}} to have different direct and indirect effects on nitrogen related processes through uptake and inhibition or stimulation of microbial activity. To assess the relative contribution of different primary producer communities and heterotrophic processes to benthic nitrogen cycling, we studied nitrogen uptake and bacterial denitrification in the eutrophic Sacca di Goro lagoon (northern Italy). Benthic fluxes of oxygen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and rates of nitrification coupled (Dn) and water–nitrate (Dw) denitrification were measured every 30 – 45 days for one year at two shallow sites. Station Giralda is close to the main freshwater inlet, has turbid waters and muddy-organic and bioturbated sediments with microphytobenthos (MPB). Station Gorino is brackish with muddy-sand sediments which are covered by macroalgal mats of the genus Ulva. Here, sediment patches with and without macroalgae (MA) were simultaneously studied. Sediments with MPB were net heterotrophic and regenerated large amounts of ammonium to the water column. At Gorino, sediments with MA were net autotrophic through the year, and DIN fluxes were mainly controlled by macroalgal uptake. On an annual basis, denitrification rates were three fold higher at Giralda (2. 27 ± 0. 06 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2 yr− 1) than at Gorino (0. 83 ± 0. 01 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2 yr− 1), due to higher nitrate in the water column and nitrification in surface sediments. At Gorino, denitrification was one order of magnitude lower than DIN uptake by macroalgae (10. 39 ± 1. 30 <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> m− 2 yr− 1). Nevertheless, the differences between denitrification rates in sediments with and without MA were unexpectedly negligible, showing that the denitrification capacity was not suppressed by macroalgal competition. Results from this study suggest that in eutrophic lagoons nitrogen cycling seems less affected by MPB compared to more oligotrophic coastal waters and that most of the available DIN flows through benthic macroalgae. However, Ulva is only a temporary N-sink and most of its nitrogen pool can be either rapidly recycled or exported by tidal currents to the open sea...|$|R

We compared long-term patterns of concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in aquatic ecosystems of the Arbutus Lake watershed to evaluate how a lake nested in a forested watershed affects the sources (e. g., production) and sinks (e. g., retention) of DOC and DON in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. We observed no significant long-term changes of DOC and DON in the lake outlet since 1983 and 1994, respectively. However, the temporal patterns of DOC and DON concentrations in the lake inlet showed significant seasonality such as increases during the vegetation growing season along with notable decreases in the dormant season. A comparison of mass balances between inlet and outlet for the period from 2000 to 2009 suggested that the lake was a sink of DOC (mean of influx minus out flux: + 1140 mol C ha(- 1) yr(- 1)). In contrast, the difference of discharge-weighted DON concentrations (mean of inlet minus outlet: 1. 0 mu <b>mol</b> <b>N</b> L- 1) between inlet and outlet was much smaller than the discharge-weighted DOC concentrations (average of inlet minus outlet: + 87 mu mol C L- 1).

The resultant increase of DON within the lake was closely linked with a net decrease of DIN through monthly Pearson correlation analysis, suggesting the importance of biotic factors in mediating lake DON dynamics Our results show different relative retentions of DOC compared with DON, along with a larger retention of DIN than DON, suggesting that DOC and DON might display substantially different biogeochemical relationships in oligo-mesotrophic lakes nested forested watersheds and therefore different roles for a sink behavior for DOC compared to a producer of DON.
