40|$|The worked example effect {{indicates}} that showing students worked examples (high guidance) {{is superior to}} problem solving (low guidance) which provides no guidance, whereas the generation effect suggests that self-generating items (low guidance) is superior to studying the externally presented answers (high guidance). This obvious contradiction between the two effects was hypothesized to be resolved by suggesting that the materials used had different levels of element interactivity. For the worked example effect, materials may be high in element interactivity, while, for the generation effect, simpler materials are used. With an increase of learner expertise, the worked example effect may be eliminated or reversed because expertise reduces element interactivity, but the generation effect should be still robust. Five 2 (levels of guidance: low and high) x 2 (levels of element interactivity: low and high) <b>mixed</b> <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> were conducted to investigate the hypotheses.

The case study evaluates two informationally equivalent, but differently designed online interactive map interfaces presented to novice users. In a <b>mixed</b> <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment,</b> thirty participants were asked to solve three typical map-use tasks using one of the two interfaces; we then measured user satisfaction, efficiency (completion time) and effectiveness (accuracy) with standard SEE usability metrics. While traditional (bottom line) usability metrics can reveal a range of usability problems, they may be enhanced by additional procedural measures such as eye movement recordings. Eye movements have been shown to help reveal the amount of cognitive processing a display requires and where these cognitive resources are required. Therefore, we can establish how a display may or may not facilitate task completion by analyzing eye movement recordings. User satisfaction information related to tested stimuli (i. e., collected through standardized questionnaires) can also be linked to eye tracking data for further analysis. We hope that the presented methodology and case study will help cartographers and map interface designers to better identify design issues in their products, and that these insights will eventually lead to more effective and efficient online map interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Two or more factor <b>mixed</b> <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common in microarray data analysis. In this case study, the two factors are presence (Patients with Alzheimer's disease) or absence (Control) of the disease, and brain regions including olfactory bulb (OB) or cerebellum (CER). In the design considered in this manuscript, OB and CER are repeated measurements from the same subject and, hence, are correlated. It is critical to identify sources of variability {{in the analysis of}} oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures and correlations among data points have to be considered. In addition, multiple testing problems are more complicated in experiments with multi-level treatments or treatment combinations. Results In this study we adopted a linear mixed model to analyze oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We first construct a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at 5 % was applied to the P values of the generalized F test. For those genes with significant generalized F test, we then categorize them based on whether the interaction terms were significant or not at the α -level (α new = 0. 0033) determined by the FDR procedure. Since simple effects may be examined for the genes with significant interaction effect, we adopt the protected Fisher's least significant difference test (LSD) procedure at the level of α new to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) for each gene examined. Conclusions A linear mixed model is appropriate for analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We constructed a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes, and then applied a specific sequence of tests to identify factorial effects. This sequence of tests applied was designed to control for gene based FWER. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{designing}} a fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment,</b> {{a class of}} models with some common parameters is considered for describing the data to {{be obtained from the}} experiment. The uncommon parameters of these models are to be estimated with the same variance as best as possible. Fractional factorial designs are obtained with the various variance structures in terms of their equalities. A special variance structure having the equal variances of the estimators of all uncommon parameters is the main theme of this thesis. In particular the 2 -factor interaction effect is considered as the uncommon parameter in each model. Such plans with the ability of estimating the uncommon parameter with equal precision are called Common Variance (CV) designs. From the class of all CV designs for particular values of the number of factors m and the number of runs n designs giving smallest value of CV are obtained. Such designs are called Optimum CV designs. Both symmetric and asymmetric <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> are considered with factors at two and three levels. Two series of CV designs are obtained for general 3 ^m <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> with different number of runs. The common variance property is characterized for general fractional factorial designs. Several sufficient conditions are obtained using projection matrix and runs of the designs. The projection matrices of the series of CV designs for general m are investigated and a special structure of the projection matrix is presented for the CV designs including the optimum CV designs. Optimum CV designs are also presented for these two series for different m. CV designs are obtained with replicated runs. It is shown that a 3 ^ 2 CV design which is optimum in the class of all CV designs for n= 6 remains CV after replicating any of its six runs any number of times. Several other 3 ^ 2 CV designs for n= 6 are presented which satisfy this general replication property.

Previous research has used primarily offline stimuli, such as restaurant menus and sequential presentation of apartments to examine price order effects. This study adds online SaaS plan pricing tables as a new entry to that set of stimuli. Further, no previous study has examined the price order effect {{and the effect of}} a free choice in the same experiment, which is a novel contribution from this thesis to the area of research. A <b>mixed</b> <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> design was employed, in which participants were randomly assigned to 4 treatments differing on the price presentation order and the presence of a free choice. Respondents had to choose a plan on two pricing tables. The two pricing tables differed on product category familiarity, the within-subjects factor, which tested results from previous research in the new SaaS context. Effects of price presentation order, presence of a free choice, and product category familiarity were tested against plan choice. The results confirm that price presentation order affects consumer choice, as found in previous research. Contrary to previous research, product category familiarity did not moderate the effect of price presentation order on plan choice, which may be a consequence of a weaker than expected manipulation. The presence of a free choice was not found to have an effect on plan choice...|$|E

Findings indicated that both tremors and swells had a significant effect on performance ratings, such that performance profiles with a high level of tremors were rated more favorably than profiles with a low level of tremors, and profiles with a positive/negative swell were rated significantly higher/lower than profiles without a swell. As predicted, tremors had a significant effect on rater attributions of effort such that raters attributed higher amounts of effort to performance profiles with a high level of tremors compared to profiles with a low level of tremors. Swells had a significant effect on rater attributions of ability as well as attributions of effort such that raters attributed positive swells to higher levels of ability and effort and negative swells to lower levels of ability and effort. Contrary to expectation, rater locus of control did not moderate the variability performance rating relationship. However, exploratory analyses revealed that rater locus of control moderated the relationship between swells and attributions of locus of causality, such that raters with an internal locus of control tended to attribute swells internally rather than externally.
