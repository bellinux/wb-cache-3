We sent political solicitations to potential congressional campaign donors that contained either reference information about the past donations of those in the same party (cooperative treatment), those in the competing party (competition treatment), or no information (the control group). The donation rate in the competitive and cooperative treatment groups was 85 % and 42 % above that in the control, respectively. Both treatments contained a <b>monetary</b> <b>reference</b> point, which in‡uenced the distribution of donations. While the cooperative treatment induced more contributions concentrated near the mentioned reference point, the competitive treatment induced more contributions at nearly twice the level of the given reference point, leading to a higher total contributed amount.

The results also suggest changes in ECB communications occurred: using more introductory statements as reference texts improves the match between estimated positions and actual policy. Overall, we would characterize ECB communication during the first decade of EMU as internally consistent.

40|$|International {{capital markets}} {{have grown to}} be a major force shaping today's world economy, {{presenting}} a range of opportunities and threats to developing countries. Capital market liberalization created large pools of much-needed capital that developing economies could access, but tapping these funds often came at the cost of increasing economic vulnerability, lost policy-making autonomy and a range of structural distortions that could ultimately undermine development in the long-term. As the potential threats of integrating one's country into global capital markets has become apparent, countries have devised a range of strategies to buffer themselves from the strains of global capital markets. This article considers the pursuit of <b>monetary</b> autonomy with <b>reference</b> to a typology of the strategies that policy-makers can use to open their markets to international capital, while simultaneously attempting to buffer themselves from the economic and political pressures of global financial integration. Such autonomy can be purchased in a myriad of ways, and a discussion of the choices facing Latin American and Eastern European countries is presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{sketches}} {{the origins}} of paper money in Norway back to {{the last half of}} the 18 th century and asks why there was no circulation of full-bodied coins even after notes had become convertible into silver at par in 1842. The argument put forward is that the choice of fiat paper money reflected the relative economic backwardness of the country. Although Gresham’s law also applied for Norway, the most important reason paper money caught on and maintained that position as the most important part of the money stock was the chronic shortage of means of payment. In such a situation, bad money was not that bad after all. Moreover, times of war and political havoc besides, paper money managed to stay fairly stable and fulfil an essential function as a store of wealth. With time, paper money became institutionalised in the Norwegian economy, overwhelmingly dominating the domestic circulation and functioning as the key <b>monetary</b> <b>reference</b> (unit of account). Thus, convertibility in 1842 linked the domestic currency with international money at fixed rates, but had hardly any bearing on the domestic function of money.

40|$|I {{argue that}} it is useful to think about the optimal design of {{monetary}} institutions using the insights from the theory of incomplete contracts. The core of the monetary policy problem is the uncertainty about future social decisions resulting from the impossibility and the undesirability of committing our successors to any given monetary policy strategy. The impossibility stems from the observation that collective decisions cannot be enforced so {{that it is impossible to}} commit to future collective decisions. The undesirability reflects the fact that we cannot articulate all possible future states of the world. Monetary institutions expand the possibility frontier of the technology of collective decisions by raising the costs of making inefficient deviationsng from pre-announced paths. Institutions also become repositories of experience and knowledge to facilitate learning about the economic environment and communication to society as a whole. I illustrate the importance of institutional design for the operation of <b>monetary</b> policy by <b>reference</b> to three case studies: the collapse of exchange rate regimes in Brazil and the United Kingdom; currency arrangements in Iraq and their reform after the 2003 war; and the relationship between central banks and governments when the zero constraint on nominal interest rates is binding. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of money demand {{and the study}} of its stability are still relevant issues, as the effects of monetary policies are also analyzed {{on the basis of the}} movements in the demand for money. Therefore, understanding the functioning of money demand is extremely important for monetary policy decisions. In this paper we study money demand in the euro-area, investigating if its estimated stability is influenced by the monetary aggregate employed. This aspect is particularly relevant in the context of the European Monetary Union (EMU), as the European Central Bank (ECB) conducts monetary policy on the basis of the broad money aggregate M 3 and one of the most relevant problems for monetary policy decisions in this area is the instability of money demand. By employing panel data techniques, we are able to show that the stability of the relation between money demand and its determinants changes depending on the monetary aggregate (M 1, M 2 or M 3) employed as a proxy for money demand. Moreover, money demand is substantially more stable when M 2 is considered. Then, by switching from M 3 to M 2 as the <b>reference</b> <b>monetary</b> aggregate can increase the estimated money demand stability and improve the performance of the ECB’s monetary policy. This result is also confirmed by splitting the sample in two separate groups of countries. Nevertheless, in less stable economies the impact of inflation on money demand is significantly higher, while in more stable economies the role of income is more relevant...|$|R
30|$|Based on the foregoing, {{we define}} {{relative}} energy prices = energy prices/general price level; here both the relative energy prices and energy prices are domestic indices. Thus, {{we can use}} research {{on the effects of}} <b>monetary</b> policy as <b>references.</b> Generally speaking, the basic coefficient is BCE = GDP growth indexation/CPI, where GDP growth indexation is profit and CPI is the cost of monetary policy. Using this equation as a reference, we consider that energy prices can impact both energy consumption and the general price level. The former represents profit, while the latter represents the cost of the pricing policy. Then, the ratio of the two components is the effect of the energy price lever, which includes consideration of energy conservation. In addition, Zhang et al. (2014 a, b) show that once inflation is considered, a central bank’s monetary policy that aims to control inflation may also influence energy prices, which means that there is a transmission chain through “energy prices–price level–energy prices” in practice. Moreover, excluding the general price level in examining energy prices not only may reflect the real variation in energy prices but also may consider the cost of price lever regulation and even the endurance of the economy’s price system, which is more instructive in practice. It is through this mechanism that Amano (1990) indicates that rising real energy prices may result in energy savings. In general, the inflation cost in this paper fundamentally includes two aspects: first, according to the analysis described above, inflation itself is a cost of pricing policy; second, inflation may result in many costs, such as shoe-leather costs, menu costs and tax distortions. In this paper, we do not focus on the specific costs in detail. We only assume that all costs are reflected by the general price level. Then, the question becomes, how can the general price level be excluded in examining energy prices? Using the relationship between nominal variables and real variables (such as the nominal and real interest rate, the nominal and real product price index, and nominal and real energy prices) as a reference (Yamada 2002; Shen and Wang 2000; Yang 2009), 5 we first consider the difference between energy prices and the general price level. However, {{the difference between the two}} indices may be negative, which prevents the use of the natural logarithm and influences the models in empirical research, and the absolute value of the difference does not reflect rising and falling price variations. Therefore, the ratio between the two indices can reasonably be adopted. Based on the foregoing, we utilize relative prices to reflect the real energy prices such that the inflation cost of energy price variations is excluded, and the effects of relative energy prices on energy consumption are therefore analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Most {{people know}} little about their country's central bank; so far as they are concerned, a central bank is merely {{involved}} in determining the interest rate on their home loans and overdrafts. As recent events in the global financial markets have shown, however, {{there is more to}} a central bank than lending rates and signatures on banknotes. On Wednesday, 8 October 2008, world central banks intervened in an effort to alleviate clogged money markets and reinstil confidence in the panic-stricken international financial system and the global economy. Six central banks, including the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, cut interest rates together. Other central banks that also cut interest rates included those of Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland. China also cut interest rates, though it did not join in the group statement. This was the first coordinated interest rate reduction since the terrorist attacks in the United States of America in September 2001. The global economy is showing clear signs of financial duress and distress. National and international media reports are dominated by references to higher energy prices, higher food prices, a slowdown in economic growth, monetary instability and the ever-present fear of uncontrollable inflation. These concerns prevail not merely in one or two countries, but worldwide, involving some of the biggest economies and <b>monetary</b> role-players. Regular <b>reference</b> is made to the 'credit crunch' and sub-prime mortgage crises in the United States of America that have created extra-territorial financial losses in Europe and the United Kingdom in particular. There is a significant downturn in the United Kingdom housing market, whilst the European Union is experiencing a definite economic slowdown. The consequences of these issues are not only of concern to private companies, financial institutions and multinational corporations, but are equally important to all governments, public institutions, and ultimately every human being. As a result the turmoil in financial markets has a global impact, and quick and decisive steps would indeed be in the interest of both public and private sectors. Although often forgotten, the poorest people of the world are the hardest hit in troubled times. Every government has a responsibility to act, taking appropriate steps to protect its people and ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to aid them during difficult times. The central bank {{is one of the most}} important institutions created to manage economic growth and fiscal stability in a country. It is customary for most states in the world to create and empower a specific institution to manage and oversee certain financial powers and functions. These institutions are of particular importance for financial markets and local economies because the proper fulfilment of their functions is directly attributable to economic growth, inflationary control and financial stability. Central banks were established throughout the world because of the realisation that under typical, normal conditions of banking and financial business, it was advantageous to have centralised monetary reserves, currency control and credit management that enjoyed the support of the state and were subject to some form of governmental supervision and participation. A central bank should be created by legislative intervention as a core pillar within a particular financial system. Given the differences of circumstances and political structures, the central banks in each country have different constitutional positions. However, these banks not only act 'offensively' (pro-actively), but are often also called upon to act defensively in times of financial trouble and instability. Although it must be noted that the creation of central banks is no guarantee against financial crisis, their quick and committed fulfilment of their powers and functions should have an important impact on financial markets, with resultant benefits for consumer bankruptcies and corporate failures and liquidations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained essays on policy rules and macroeconomic behaviour of an emerging market economy, {{in addition to the}} introductory first chapter. It examines monetary and fiscal policy performance, develops a small open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and investigates welfare-maximising optimal <b>monetary</b> rules, with <b>reference</b> to the Sri Lankan economy. The second chapter empirically characterises the monetary policy of Sri Lanka using alternative policy reaction functions. The estimation results suggest that the Taylor rule captures the monetary policy reaction characteristics in Sri Lanka more closely than the McCallum rule. The results further implies that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) follows a contemporaneous or backward-looking rule instead of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. The results indicate that the CBSL responds to inflation fairly strongly while stabilising output aggressively. It is also found that the CBSL smoothes out policy action strongly. This suggests that the CBSL implements policy gradually in small steps in the desired direction, without making immediate sharp changes. The third chapter investigates the fiscal policy performance of Sri Lanka in the period subsequent to the implementation of numerical fiscal targets in 2003. It estimates alternative fiscal policy rules widely used in literature including tax difference rules, primary balance rules and Taylor-type fiscal rules for Sri Lanka. I find that the fiscal authority contemporaneously responds to changes in output gap and government expenditure moderately, by changing the tax rate. Moreover, it implies that the fiscal policy in Sri Lanka is procyclical rather than countercyclical. The fourth chapter develops a New Keynesian (NK) small open-economy (SOE) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. This study is different from most of the other available SOE studies, as it includes an explicit fiscal sector in the model. The model is estimated for Sri Lanka using Bayesian techniques. The dynamics of the model in response to different shocks are examined to understand the relative importance of the business cycle drivers. The properties of the estimated rules are analysed to identify the policy reaction behaviour of the monetary and fiscal authorities. The estimation results suggest that over the sample period, the CBSL conducted moderately strong anti-inflationary monetary policy while paying substantial attention to output stabilisation, however, with negligibly small concerns for exchange rate movements. The findings suggest a high degree of interest rate persistence as well. The findings further imply that the fiscal authority of Sri Lanka changes its policy instrument, the tax rate, only moderately in response to changes in debt level, government expenditure or output. The fifth chapter computes welfare-maximising optimal monetary policy rules for Sri Lanka based on a slightly simplified variant of the DSGE model discussed in the fourth chapter. I calculate second-order accurate solutions to the model, which facilitate welfare computation across various policy rules. I determine optimal monetary policy rules such that the welfare associated with them is {{as close as possible to}} the Ramsey optimal allocation. The welfare cost of adopting alternative rules, instead of the optimal, is determined to evaluate the relative importance of the different policy rules. There are several key findings. First, the optimal monetary policy rule suggests an aggressive response to inflation and a moderate response to output-gap. Second, the optimal policy advocates a muted response to exchange rate fluctuations. Third, the welfare gains from interest rate smoothing are significant. Finally, the welfare losses associated with the current realised monetary policy rule for Sri Lanka can be mitigated significantly by responding to inflation more strongly. Finally, the sixth chapter summarises the key findings and concludes the thesis. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.
