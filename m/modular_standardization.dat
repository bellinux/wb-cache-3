40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and reflects}} on the design and manufacturing process of the Tree-Structure canopy for the WestendGate Tower in Frankfurt upon Main, completed early 2011. The project investigated fabrication and assembly principles of complex steel structures {{as well as the}} integration of contemporary computational design, engineering, optimization and simulation techniques in a collaborative design approach. This paper focuses on the notion of <b>modular</b> <b>standardization</b> as opposed to non standard customized components. It also engages with issues relating to digital production tools and their impact on construction cost, material performance and tolerances. In addition it examines the reconfiguration of liability during a planning and construction process, an aspect which can be strongly determined by fabrication companies rather than the architect or designer. This paper is written as a reflection on the complete building process when contemporary digital tools are used from design through to fabrication. It studies both the generation of the steel structure as well the ETFE cushion skin. It reports on a collaborative project, where the main author was responsible for the canopies design, parameterization, digitalization and fabrication, {{as well as for the}} dissemination of the outcomes and findings during the design and realization process. As such it represents an example of research through design in a contemporary and evolving field. The canopy received a design award by the Hellenic Architecture Association...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a family}} of generic earth pointing satellites. The smallest configuration is sized to fit a Get Away Special (GAS) container (2. 5 cubic feet). The basic core of the largest member is sized to be scout launch vehicle compatible (18 cubic feet). The smallest member can easily accommodate 125 pounds of payload and generate 200 watts of electrical power. The largest can carry 500 pounds of payload and generate 1 Kilowatt of power. This family of earth pointing satellites is based on modular components that allow upward compatibility. To keep cost per unit volume low, tried and proven components are used which reduce testing of the integrated satellite. The <b>modular</b> design and <b>standardization</b> of power, and command and telemetry functions allow for ease of integration and system level checkout. The family limitations and their solutions are discussed as well as tradeoffs of various structural fabrication methods (metallic vs. composite vs. plastic) ...|$|R
40|$|Expanding product {{variety and}} high {{customer}} service provision are both major challenges for manufacturers {{to compete in}} the global market. In addition to many ongoing programs, such as lead-time reduction, redesigning products and processes so as to delay the point of product differentiation is becoming an emerging means to address these challenges. Such a strategy calls for redesigning products and processes so that the stages of the production process in which a common process is used are prolonged. This product/process redesign will defer the point of differentiation (i. e., defer the stage after which the products assume their unique identities). In this paper, we develop a simple model that captures the costs and benefits associated with this redesign strategy. We apply this simple model to analyze some special cases that are motivated by real examples. These special cases enable us to formalize three different product/process redesign approaches (<b>standardization,</b> <b>modular</b> design, and process restructuring) for delaying product differentiation that some companies are beginning to pursue. Finally, we analyze some special theoretical cases that enable us to characterize the optimal point of product differentiation and derive managerial insights. product/process redesign, product differentiation, mathematical models...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{the high}} cost of {{optoelectronic}} (OE) devices is caused in part by the labor-intensive processes involved with packaging. Automating the packaging processes should result in a significant cost reduction. One of the most labor-intensive steps is aligning and attaching the fiber to the OE device, the so-called pigtailing process. The goal of this 2 -year ARPA-funded project is to design and build 3 low-cost machines to perform sub-micron alignments and attachments of single-made fibers to different OE devices. These Automated Fiber Pigtailing Machines (AFPMs) are intended to be compatible with a manufacturing environment and have a <b>modular</b> design for <b>standardization</b> of parts and machine vision for maximum flexibility. This work is a collaboration among Uniphase Telecommunications Products (formerly United Technologies Photonics, UTP), Ortel, Newport/Klinger, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Manufacturing Institute (MIT), and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). UTP and Ortel are the industrial partners for whom two of the AFPMs are being built. MIT and LLNL make up the design and assembly team of the project, while Newport/Klinger is a potential manufacturer of the AFPM and provides guidance to ensure that the design of the AFPM is marketable and compatible with a manufacturing environment. The AFPM for UTP will pigtail LiNbO{sub 3 } waveguide devices and the AFPM for Ortel will pigtail photodiodes. Both of these machines will contain proprietary information, so the third AFPM, to reside at LLNL, will pigtail a non-proprietary waveguide device for demonstrations to US industry...|$|R
