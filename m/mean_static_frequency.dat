40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{three-phase}} squirrel-cage {{induction motor}} is rugged, compact, inexpensive, can be totally enclosed and requires little maintenance. Its {{use as a}} variable speed drive has been limited, however, by the state-of-the art of control components. The advent and continuing development of the silicon controlled rectifier and associated solid-state components has provided the technology for conceiving a <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> converter to allow continuous motor speed adjustment over a wide range. The <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> converter system adjusts the motor input frequency and voltage so the motor can match a given load speed-torque requirement. The high cost and low thermal overload capabilities of the solidstate components required for a prototype dictate the use of modeling and simulation techniques for analysis of complex systems such as the <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> converter motor speed control system...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{stability}} {{concerns the}} ability of a power system to maintain synchronism after a large disturbance. Transient stability {{plays an important role in}} guaranteeing operational security and reliability and has been extensively studies for large 50 Hz and 60 Hz transmission systems. However, transient stability of low frequency railway grids has not been properly investigated. As low frequency railway grids operate at another frequency than the public grid, conversion of frequency is needed. This conversion is performed by Rotary Frequency Converters or by <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converters. These two types of converters have a different impact on stability. In this thesis, the overall aim is to obtain knowledge on transient stability in low frequency railway grids, with focus on the Swedish synchronous-synchronous railway grid with a mix of Rotary and <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converters. The transient stability problem is approached by developing a simplified model of a <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converter that can be used for the stability studies in low <b>frequency</b> railways. The <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converter is modelled as single phase generator with an equivalent inertia and damping. However as <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> converters cannot handle currents much above their ratings, current limitation is implemented. The current limitation is needed to avoid unnecessary tripping of the converter during fault or other high current situations. With the model developed for a <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converter and with a simplified model of a Rotary Frequency Converter, transient stability studies have been performed for several test systems representing the Swedish railway grid. The simulations performed shows the appearance of power oscillations after a large disturbance, between a <b>Static</b> <b>Frequency</b> Converter and a Rotary Frequency Converter when these are operating in parallel. The simulations also showed that the systems studied were stable for realistic values of the fault-clearing time.

40|$|A divide-by-four circuit divides {{frequencies}} from 31 GHz to 41 GHz at {{input signal}} amplitudes ≤ 0. 5 Vpp. The implemented circuit {{consists of a}} dynamic followed by a <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> divider. The dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> dividers consume 2 mA and 1 mA, respectively, from a 1. 1 V supply. Paper: Future high-density chip-to-chip links require data rates of up to 40 Gb/s per channel to meet the Tb/s aggregate bandwidth demand. Transmitter and receiver incorporate D-flip-flops (DFF), consisting of two latches (TFF) to retime the data, ideally at full-rate speed. The clock driving the DFFs is generated by a PLL, which therefore requires a full-rate frequency divider in the CMU. The prescaler typically is the speed-limiting block. In addition, due to the limited system power budget, all circuits need to be optimized for low power consumption. Consequently, the design of low-power and high-speed frequency dividers is a challenging task. The implemented circuit shown in Fig. 1 consists of a dynamic and a <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> divider followed by a 50 Ω buffer for test and measurement equipment.

This is the first reported digital circuit in this material system employing such Ccb reduction techniques. The divider operation is fully static, operating from fclk = 4 GHz to 61. 2 GHz while dissipating ≤ 27. 1 mW {{of power in the}} flip-flop from a single- 2. 30 V supply. The power-delay product of this circuit is 113. 0 fJ/latch if all devices in the latch are considered, and 63. 2 fJ/latch if the power associated with the voltage level-shifting emitter followers is not included in the power-delay calculation.

40|$|Design of {{a digital}} dynamic divider in SiGe bipolar {{technology}} {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed digital dynamic frequency divider is based on two latches connected with negative feedback. However, {{in contrast to the}} conventional <b>static</b> <b>frequency</b> divider the latching differential pair has been completely omitted to reduce the load for the sensing differential pair to extend the maximum operating frequency. Two versions of dynamic dividers (A and B) are fabricated to validate the concept. The divide ratio for version A is two while that for version B is four.
