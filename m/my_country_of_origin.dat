At {{the age of}} 24, he quit that job after a story he produced that was critical of Mexico's government was censored. In 1983, he left Mexico on a student visa for Los Angeles, California, where he planned to enroll in the UCLA Extension's journalism classes. In 1984, {{he was hired by}} KMEX-TV, an affiliate of what was then the Spanish International Network in Los Angeles, which operated on a shoestring budget in a run-down facility on Melrose Avenue. At KMEX, Ramos felt he could express himself freely: [...] "To me it was a palace... the United States gave me opportunities that <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> could not: freedom of the press and complete freedom of expression." [...] Two years later, he became the host for KMEX's morning program, Mundo Latino. Ramos then joined SIN's national operation in 1985, a year before the network was placed under new ownership under the new branding of the Univision network, which has a broad entertainment and news-sharing agreement with Televisa.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, the Daily Mail {{reported}} that James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne {{were involved in}} a 'bitter row' over tax. Bannatyne claimed Pakistan-born Caan had an 'unfair' business advantage due to his non-domiciled tax status. He complained that, because Caan does not pay UK tax on his overseas earnings, he has more money to invest in his UK ventures. Caan told the London Evening Standard: [...] "I do not apologise for <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Pakistan." [...] He also said he could not invest with anyone who had a criminal record - a reference to Bannatyne's having served a sentence in military prison when he was a teenager in the Royal Navy. Bannatyne replied that Caan was 'playing the race card' and 'personalising the whole thing', and accused him of implying he was racist. Only days before the filming of series 8, Bannatyne went on to Twitter, pointing out that Caan is chairman of the Big Issue, which employs sellers with criminal pasts, and asking how they could now work with their chief. He brought the name of the Big Issue founder into the row by asking: 'Did John Bird know about James Caan's view on ex-prisoners when he gave him the chairman's role?' Further fanning the flames for Caan was a well publicised critique of accusations that he offered to buy a baby from a family in Pakistan. On 7 January 2011, the BBC announced James Caan had quit the Dragons' Den panel. The BBC announced regret and sorrow over the exit and thanked him for his efforts over his four series in the show. Clive Morgan of The Daily Telegraph criticised his departure, stating his exit was the show's loss and would not be the same without him. He was replaced by Hilary Devey in February 2011.|$|E

40|$|What does quality mean in {{the context}} of education? Many {{definitions}} of quality in education exist, testifying to the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the concept. The terms efficiency, effectiveness, equity and quality have often been used synonymously. Considerable consensus exists around the basic dimensions of quality education today, however. According to Adams (1993), quality education includes learners who are healthy and well-nourished to participate in learning, environments that are safe, healthy and protective with adequate resources and facilities, relevant curricula and materials for the acquisition of skills, trained teachers who use child-centred teaching approaches in well-managed classrooms, and outcomes that encompass knowledge, skills and attitudes, linked to national education goals and positive participation in society. In Guyana, <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> the issue of quality education is becoming wide-spread. Parents, teachers, students, community folk and other stakeholders are calling for change and for renewed efforts towards fulfilling the mandate of quality education to students, so that they can become knowledgeable, thinking and productive citizens in society.

This work was conducted through interviews of two teachers - a university teacher and a secondary school teacher. The results showed that teachers did not show much interest in increasing elements of technology in students' education, even if they understood the importance of it. Raising the technical level of the students was perceived by teachers as difficult to implement because of time constraints. Technical exercises were nevertheless something they both felt they had more use of in their teaching. Validerat; 20140211 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

We all {{remember}} the lyrics of some songs verbatim, despite the passage of time, recalling where we were, who we were with, and what we were doing when we first listened. Music crosses borders-it generates emotions and feelings which transport us to a different place and time. Moreover, music has insurgent sociopolitical power-among other things, it can rally the masses, encourage affiliations, and demarcate normative boundaries. As a vehicle of easily digestible messages, music not only entertains, but it speaks volumes even when played quietly. 2 ̆ 2 Music is not mere entertainment but ideological weaponry.... 2 ̆ 2 For these reasons, music creates lasting impressions. As with perspectives generated by other art forms, the impressions created by music can range from positive to negative.

Since the explosion of the use of the Internet, things are changing rapidly, not only in everyday life but also in the companies’ behaviour. Then, this study’s purpose is to see how the companies are adapting to improve their business using the Internet. The study is carried in the area of Industrial Marketing specifically in the field of Industrial Buying Behaviour. The objective of this work is to investigate and find how the Industrial Buying Behaviour and its components has changed due to the introduction of the Internet. To carry on the study I focused on Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s) from <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Catalonia: with a study of three companies I could investigate how everything was changing. The Buying Process seems to have not many significant changes due to the introduction of the Internet, since all the steps taken previously are still present. The most important difference is that this new source of information has replaced in most cases the traditional ways of finding new suppliers. In the Buying Center the roles have not changed but it seems to be more influencers since more people have access to the information, and the gatekeeper is losing importance since all the information is on the Internet. Regarding to the factors affecting the Buying Process, the most significant factors are still price, quality and technical capability. The factors for selecting a supplier are the same but geographical location is losing importance since the introduction of the Internet because many far away suppliers are found, that can compete with local ones in order to reduce costs. Moreover, although the managers state that the Internet availability is not a factor for selecting a supplier, in some cases a supplier has been preferred due to this reason. To sum up, some changes can be seen but it is still early to see how everything will be established when the companies adapt the Internet at all levels, {{it will be interesting to}} carry a similar study in some years from now.

40|$|Teacher {{workplace}} learning (TWPL) is {{an essential}} strategy for increasing opportunities for professional development towards maintaining teacher competencies for high quality teaching. Workplace learning {{is a relatively new}} concept in most developing countries. In Uganda (<b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin)</b> there are a few private schools where TWPL is a common practice. In most schools, however, teachers rely on distance education and, occasional, formal in-service training usually organized by district officials of government, that take the form of single- loop workshops or short courses external to the schools. In Pakistan (the context for this study) teachers engage more in site-based learning because few institutions offer formal pre-service and in-service teacher education. Individual schools, especially of the private sector, set up structures to offer in-housing training. My experience of learning to teach in compartmentalized structures, marked with cultures of individualism, pointed to a need to understand the conditions that facilitate and inhibit teacher workplace learning at the earliest opportunity. Today, it is essential to change schools into learning communities, where teachers are learners. This study sought to examine the personal and contextual conditions that facilitate and inhibit TWPL, in order to inform the process of introducing learning communities in Uganda. Three cases were studied and are presented here, along with a cross-case analysis. Studying the cases involved three interviews each, observation of their TWPL activities, two interviews with the principal, review of both teacher-made and school documents, and keeping of reflective memos. The major finding was that both personal and contextual conditions are essential in harnessing TWPL. The exemplary and proactive leadership, and ongoing internal and external support, were major contextual conditions in buttressing TWPL. It was also clear that the ‘unique person’ in the teacher has the potential to cross the contextual hurdles and maintain and influence the working cultures, so vital in TWPL. The study has some implications for different stakeholders, given in chapter five. It is hoped that the cases presented here may offer models for the teachers to learn from. Conversely, the cases may also point to issues and undesirable practices to guard against...|$|E
40|$|The hearth of {{the works}} within this {{doctoral}} thesis is the motivation to find clues in human brain oscillations to help {{improve the quality of}} life of people with motor problems. I have mostly worked with gait movement, due to its relevance in many motor, social and cognitive aspects. My background as a mechanical engineer complementary to the work done in the neurological motor rehabilitation field has driven me to the idea that neurophysiology and biomechanics are the starting point to learn and understand motor performance. In Ecuador, <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> this thesis takes part in the good living national plan (Plan Nacional Buen Vivir) for Ecuadorian citizens. Promoted by local government from 2013 this plan has attached to an initiative started in 2007 to integrate the population, support in education and economy as well as implement facilities along the country people attained with handicaps. As the government has raised attention towards handicap there have been some difficulties to take specific actions. When looking closely to physical handicaps development and implemented help there has been a push towards basic rehabilitation and patient management but there has not been any country related research related to new methods on diagnosis nor rehabilitation. Taking research as a tool to learn how new technology can develop new diagnosis and treatment methods in the physical field, takes place the education in motor sciences. On one hand, current research has shed light into novel methods to improve motor performance for athletes as well as for people learning new motor gestures. On the other hand it has also helped to improve treatment efficiency for people suffering motor cerebral lesions like: cerebrovascular attack (CVA) and cerebral palsy. During the time of work dedicated to this doctoral thesis I have learned to address different protocols to analyze motor gestures and brain oscillations through visual perception. Our brain encompasses a changing symphony of oscillating activity throughout our lives. Up to the time we are born, we are ready to feel and move to interact with our world. Our senses develop rapidly and we start to perceive the world and learn. We visually perceive and process big amounts of information on a daily basis. At the same time we see movements from ourselves and from others in order to communicate and interact with our environment. We watch the world move. Moreover, from the links that exist between motor and sensory systems in human beings we may approach individual motor activity as a loop between a control (brain) over the effectors (muscles) which act, perceive and send the information back to the control source. The present group of works presented in this doctoral thesis is based on the correlation between human brain scalp activity, measured by means of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, visual perception and its interpretation through different approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalization}} of the English language has rendered {{both positive and}} negative impacts to countries around the world. With the ever-increasing pervasiveness of the English language, many non-native-English-speaking (NNES hereafter) people and countries have shown growing interests in teaching and learning English. Some governments of these NNES countries have decided to implement “English” as a mandatory school subject into their compulsory curriculum in order to “connect with the world” and/or to increase their nation’s international image. However, in these NNES countries, English often does not hold official capacity and is taught as a foreign language (EFL). Although English (language) education can bring positive changes to a nation, it is not free of problems. Essentially, English education influences many NNES countries and their citizens in sociocultural, economic, and educational arenas. Some scholars, such as Tsuda (2008), assert that the “problems” and impacts are inseparable from “English language hegemony. ” <b>My</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Taiwan, is one of the EFL and NNES countries that implements English education in our nation’s compulsory education. In recent decades, communicative-based English educational approaches have received great support from the Taiwanese Ministry of Education. In an EFL setting, such as that in Taiwan, the said educational approaches have complicated English education even further. In particular, the communicative-based approaches focus on teaching and practicing English oral proficiency, which average Taiwanese citizens do not need in their daily lives. Many Taiwanese people experience identity struggles and self-esteem issues because of their less-than-desirable English oral proficiency. In addition to Taiwanese, native-English-speaking (NES) teachers who are recruited to teach English in Taiwan {{are an integral part of}} the Taiwanese English education. As a Taiwanese citizen and an intercultural communication scholar, I recognize the intricate complexity of Taiwanese English education and am compelled to examine it in this dissertation as it has not received much attention in the discipline of Communication Studies. In this dissertation, I employ Identity Management Theory (IMT) (Cupach 2 ̆ 6 Imahori, 1993; Imahori 2 ̆ 6 Cupach, 2005) as the primary theoretical framework to examine Taiwanese English education. Particularly, I utilize IMT to study the identity construction and management (such as identity freezing), facework strategies, and intercultural relationship development among NES teachers, Taiwanese English teachers, and Taiwanese students. To carry out this research, I employ critical complete-member ethnography (CCME) (Toyosaki, 2011) as the central research methodology, because I see myself as a complete-member researcher with my research participants. I share complete-memberships with them in nuanced, complex, and contextual manners. Methodologically, CCME entails ethnography of communication, autoethnography, and critical ethnography; all are informative of my data collection methods, including ethnographic participant observation, ethnographic interview, and autoethnographic journaling inside and outside of English classes at different Taiwanese universities. These three methods helped me gather rich data for this research. To analyze and discuss the data, I employed thematic analysis (Owen, 1984) and critical examinations of consensual and conflictual theorization (Fiske, 1991; Toyosaki, 2011). Both methods render complex findings. In particular, the analysis and discussion reveal and explain (a) how the research participants manage cultural identities through marking scope, salience, and intensity with different English educational participants, (b) how they apply facework strategies to cope with identity freezing experiences, and (c) how they establish and maintain intercultural relationships with other English educational participants as they transition across different relational phases of their relationships. I deliver the findings thematically in an analytical and narrative-like manner, as I layer and weave together the field notes, the interview responses, and my autoethnographic journaling. Ultimately, I argue that English hegemony has glocalized in Taiwanese English education and is manifested through research participants’ identity management politics and their intercultural relationships. Essentially, my research shows that identity management politics is inseparable from the power differentials and inequalities imbued in Taiwanese English education. Voluntarily and/or involuntarily, the research participants and I have normalized English hegemony, embodied its presence in our knowledge production and consumption, and given English/Western ideologies consent to dominate our communicative choices, our (sub) consciousness, and our intercultural relationships. Aside from perpetuating English hegemony, I have also observed resistance against the said hegemonic impacts inside and outside of the English classrooms. In a power-laden intercultural communication context, such as Taiwanese English education, critical analyses and examinations play essential roles in revealing the identity management politics and power differentials embedded in the (mythically) “innocent” English classrooms. I further recognize how this research serves as an example to other EFL and NNES countries. In due course, I conclude that my research makes contributions to the scholarships of intercultural communication and to English education in Taiwan and beyond...|$|E

The study was conducted in Eskisehir (Turkey) with a sample of 413 people chosen through convenience sampling. The study data were collected with a questionnaire and face-face-to interviews. The participants’ preferences for brand name-country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> combinations were determined separately based on four different product groups(hedonic, utilitarian, durable and non-durable). The study showed that, for all the four product groups, the participants preferred the products with a Turkish brand name and Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> most, followed by the products with a French brand name and France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> This finding suggests that, with respect to the four product groups in the study, Turkish consumers preferred domestic products over foreign products. Also, the participants who preferred French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the durable product and French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the non-durable product were found to have highest tendency of conspicuous consumption in the corresponding product groups. In other words, as the level of conspicuous consumption increased, the participants tended to prefer French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the durable product and French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the non-durable product...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{panorama}} of international markets reflects an extremely competitive market, with many available products that stand out {{due to their}} quality, durability and diversification. Consequently, the process of evaluating products is increasingly more complex, due {{to the number of}} factors taken into account in the process. The <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect is one of those factors. The image <b>of</b> a <b>country</b> is directly associated with the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect and it can be shaped by the behaviour and habits of its society, the performance of its business sectors on international markets, and by the perceptions of foreigners about the country. A positive country image will reflect a positive impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect, while a negative country image will reflect a negative impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect. Portugal seems to be affected by a negative country image, but that dynamic seems to be changing. For Portuguese businesses, {{the way in which they}} work with the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> will be the difference between the success and failure in the international markets. This thesis aims to identify what is the perception of foreigners about Portugal, the strategies used by Portuguese businesses to generate a positive <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect and understand the impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect on Portugal. We understood that the case study method was the best method to identify the strategies used by Portuguese businesses to work with the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and determine the impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect on Portugal. The thesis suggests that the perception about Portugal is improving, generating a positive <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect, supported by the success of Portuguese businesses and businessmen in international markets. The key to success is how companies combine their unique natural resources with the technological innovations and strategic tools available to them...|$|R

While this notion has been established in the product context, no research has attempted to isolate similar effects <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> construct in relation to service offerings.
