25|$|The {{largest of}} the three main, titanium-clad {{buildings}} takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, {{a reference to the}} adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the <b>marine</b> <b>growth</b> removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of <b>marine</b> <b>growth</b> indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|Offshore wind {{resource}} characteristics span a {{range of}} spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions. For the North Sea, wind turbine energy is around 30kWh/m2 of sea area, per year, delivered to grid. The energy per sea area is roughly independent of turbine size. Necessary data includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations. Other factors include <b>marine</b> <b>growth,</b> salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed. A number of things are {{necessary in order to}} attain the necessary information on these subjects. Existing hardware for these measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future.|$|E
50|$|Stromatolites, {{which are}} <b>marine</b> algae <b>growths,</b> were unknown, {{and it was}} a puzzle whether these fossils were organic or {{inorganic}} products.

The density slicing processes were adjusted to correlate water radiance to bathmetric contours shown on C and GS Chart 1112. A number of large areas corresponding to water depths of 2 meters or less, 5 to 10 meters, and 10 to about 20 meters were isolated by both processes.

2500|$|The British ships by {{this time}} had hulls which gone through {{a process known as}} [...] copper sheathing; found to be a {{practicable}} means of protecting them from <b>marine</b> <b>growth</b> and fouling as well as salt water corrosion.

2500|$|In 1995, the RSN {{acquired}} a Challenger class (formerly known as Sjöormen class) submarine from the Swedish Navy and another three in 1997, making them Singapore's first underwater platforms. As the submarines {{were designed by}} the Swedish for operations in the Baltic Sea, various modifications were required to suit them to tropical waters. A comprehensive tropicalisation programme was carried out for all four submarines, which involved installing air conditioning, <b>marine</b> <b>growth</b> protection systems and corrosion-resistant piping. [...] It is believed that the Challenger class were purchased to develop the required submarine operations expertise before selecting a modern class of submarines to replace them, since all the boats are over 40 years old. The four Challenger class and two Archer class submarines form the 171 Squadron of the RSN. Two RSN Challenger-class submarines, RSS Challenger and RSS Centurion, were retired from service in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The island's {{inhabitants}} {{believed that}} the float and sailor were of naval origin, and had come from Sydney. A post-war RAN investigation determined that as the raft's description did not match those manufactured for the RAN, this claim was incorrect. Subsequent writers on the subject have disagreed: Winter states that a carley float from Sydney would have been propelled by currents into proximity of Christmas Island {{around the time of}} its discovery, while Olson claims that the description of the float's rope and markings matched those used on British ships (from whose supplies Sydney could have drawn), the boilersuit indicated a naval rating, and that the quantity of <b>marine</b> <b>growth</b> corresponded with the time such a float would have been at sea. The JCFADT inquiry concluded [...] "on the balance of probability, that the body and the carley float... were most likely from HMAS Sydney.", and while Frame was initially sceptical of the raft's origins, the evidence presented to that inquiry changed his mind.|$|E
50|$|A large float mounted {{under each}} wing {{maintained}} stability on water. With no wind, the float on the heavier side {{was always in}} the water; with some wind, the aircraft could be held using the ailerons with both floats out of the water. In the event of a float being broken off for some reason, as the craft lost airspeed after landing crew members would go out onto the opposite wing, to keep the remaining float in the water until the aircraft could reach its mooring. <b>Marine</b> <b>growths</b> on the hull were a problem; the resulting drag could be enough to prevent a fully loaded aircraft from gaining enough speed to become airborne. The aircraft could be taken to a freshwater mooring for sufficient time to kill off the fauna and flora growing on the bottom, which would then be washed away during takeoff runs. The alternative was to scrub it off, either in the water or on land.|$|R

5000|$|Rodney was ill, {{and spent}} the entire action in his bunk.

Around 2:00 pm, when Rodney felt certain that the ships seen were not the vanguard of a larger fleet, he issued commands for a general chase. [...] Rodney's instructions to his fleet were to chase at their best speed, and engage the Spanish ships from the rear as they came upon them.

2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy <b>marine</b> <b>growth.</b> Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
