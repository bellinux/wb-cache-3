5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E

Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then remained stable through the decade.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics.

Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
