40|$|Session: Wireless <b>Mesh</b> Networks (Wireless <b>Networking</b> Symposium) International audienceWe {{can improve}} the {{performance}} of wireless mesh networks by using multiple interfaces tuned to non-overlapping channels. A Channel and Interface Assignment (CIA) decides when to switch interfaces and which channel to use. Surprisingly, the impact of CIAs on connectivity has received little attention so far. In this paper, we present a comparison and performance evaluation of the existing CIA strategies addressing the connectivity issues: network topology, density of connections, and neighbor discovery. The results {{presented in this paper}} provide guidelines for network designers in planning multi-channel multi-interface network deployments...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 : Security, Access Control and Intrusion DetectionInternational audienceThis paper aims {{to propose}} a new trust-based Intrusion Detection system (IDS) for wireless, ad-hoc {{networks}} with or without mobility of nodes. In fact, the proposed solution not only detects intrusions but also proactively responds towards route setup avoiding the compromised nodes. It could be extended for <b>mesh</b> or hybrid <b>networking</b> environment too. Trust is evaluated as the weighted sum of direct evaluation of the neighboring nodes {{as well as from}} the indirect references. A sliding window is defined on the time scale and the IDS is to be evoked after every time slice. Indirect reference is derived from the recommendations of those 1 –hop neighbors of the target node that are also neighbors of the evaluating node. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated using the Qualnet network simulator. Simulation results also establish superiority of the proposed algorithm over HIDS, another recent trust-based IDS for wireless ad-hoc network...|$|R

40|$|Transnational {{networking}} {{has come}} to the fore as a strategy for coping with the increasingly stringent fiscal climate in which European municipalities have had to operate in the last two to three decades. New funding streams for policy development and implementation have emerged with the Commission’s financing of trans-European local authority networks. In this paper we consider the formation of a shared European identity and the nature and content of interauthority networking activities, drawing upon the example of one newly formed network - the edge cities network. Here we make use of original empirical material drawn from three case-study edge city municipalities - Croydon, Getafe and Noisy-le-Grand. We find that a weak form of shared European edge urban identity has developed to date, and that the direct and indirect benefits of networking are not all that they might be. There is some evidence that longstanding national traditions of interorganizational working and administrative arrangements have exerted an influence on the networking activities of {{at least one of these}} edge urban municipalities. In this respect, transnational <b>networking</b> <b>meshes</b> with aspects of local entrepreneurial coalition building which are often imbued with a sense of interlocality competition for private and public investment...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{are going}} {{increasing}} attention as a flexible low-cost networking architecture to provide media Internet access over metropolitan areas to mobile clients requiring multimedia services. In WMNs, Mesh Routers (MRs) from the mesh backbone and accomplish the twofold task of traffic forwarding, {{as well as}} providing multimedia access to mobile Mesh Clients (MCs). Due to the intensive bandwidth-resource requested for supporting QoS-demanding multimedia services, performance of the current WMNs is mainly limited by spectrum-crowding and traffic-congestion, as only scarce spectrum-resources is currently licensed for the MCs' access. In principle, this problem could be mitigated by exploiting in a media-friendly (e. g., content-aware) way the context-aware capabilities offered by the Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm. As integrated exploitation of both content and context-aware system's capabilities is at the basis of our proposed Active <b>Mesh</b> (ActMesh) <b>networking</b> paradigm. This last aims at defining a network-wide architecture for realizing media-friendly Cognitive Mesh nets (e. g., context aware Cognitive Mesh nets). Hence, main contribution of this work is four fold: 1. After introducing main functional blocks of our ActMesh architecture, suitable self-adaptive Belief Propagation and Soft Data Fusion algorithms are designed to provide context-awareness. This is done under both cooperative and noncooperative sensing frameworks. 2. The resulting network-wide resource management problem is modelled as a constrained stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem, with the dual (contrasting) objective to maximize spectrum efficiency at the network level, while accounting for the perceived quality of the delivered media flows at the client level. 3. A fully distributed, scalable and self-adaptive implementation of the resulting Active Resource Manager (ARM) is deployed, that explicitly accounts for the energy limits of the battery powered MCs and the effects induced by both fading and client mobility. Due to informationally decentralized architecture of the ActMesh net, the complexity of (possibly, optimal) centralized solutions for resource management becomes prohibitive when number of MCs accessing ActMesh net grow. Furthermore, centralized resource management solutions could required large amounts of time to collect and process the required network information, which, in turn, induce delay that can be unacceptable for delay sensitive media applications, e. g., multimedia streaming. Hence, it is important to develop network-wide ARM policies that are both distributed and scalable by exploiting the radio MCs capabilities to sense, adapt and coordinate themselves. We validate our analytical models via simulation based numerical tests, that support actual effectiveness of the overall ActMesh paradigm, both in terms of objective and subjective performance metrics. In particular, the basic tradeoff among backbone traffic-vs-access traffic arising in the ActMesh net from the bandwidth-efficient opportunistic resource allocation policy pursued by the deployed ARM is numerically characterized. The standardization framework we inspire to is the emerging IEEE 802. 16 h one...|$|R
