5|$|The venom of {{the black}} mamba is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%. The bite of a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less. Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities, and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{toothache}} and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since {{many cases of}} toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as [...] with a peptic ulcer). [...] Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>dose.</b> For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose {{is more likely to}} occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing eugenol (such as clove oil) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.|$|E

The bed height was raised by 4 to 8 cm from the bed base-point position (BP, 0 cm). Fluoroglass dosimeters were placed in three lines at 5 -cm intervals {{on the surface of}} the phantom. The <b>maximum</b> skin <b>dose</b> conversion factors were calculated as the ratio of the calculated and the actual <b>maximum</b> skin <b>doses.</b> Results:At heights of 6 and 8 cm,calculated ESDs had peak values of 93. 0 ± 0. 2 and 74. 5 ± 2. 7 mGy,respectively, whereas the actual <b>maximum</b> skin <b>doses</b> were in the range of 47. 4 ± 0. 2 to 59. 5 ± 0. 2 mGy.

6000|$|Having learned such precautions, Martin {{consulted}} [...] "The Duchess" [...] for tone, {{and proceeded}} to mix according to formula.

The third part was an unvarying quantity, but {{the first and second}} parts could be varied an infinite number of times. Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl's heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly. It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses.
