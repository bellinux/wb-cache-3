5|$|The Bhagavata Purana (6.18.3-6) lists Varuna and Mitra {{as having}} {{children}} through ayoni or non-vaginal sex.

5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being.

5|$|All kanyas lack <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti {{is adopted}} at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E

5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by <b>mothers.</b> <b>In</b> 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their <b>mothers.</b> <b>In</b> some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and <b>mothers.</b> <b>In</b> Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
