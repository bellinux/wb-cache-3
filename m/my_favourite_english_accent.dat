40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study into the {{reactions}} of ‘native’ speakers of British English to Dutch-English pronunciations in the onset of a telephone sales talk. In an experiment 144 highly educated British professionals who were either familiar or not familiar with Dutch-accented English responded to a slight Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accent,</b> a moderate Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accent</b> or a ‘Standard British English accent’ (BrE). These accents were rated on the personality traits status and affect, on their intelligibility (orthographic transcription), comprehensibility (identification of key words), and interpretability (paraphrasing {{the purpose of the}} message). Although British English was more intelligible and comprehensible than both Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accents,</b> all three accents were equally interpretable. The results indicated that a British English pronunciation evoked more status than both Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accents,</b> and both British English and the slight Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accent</b> commanded more affect than the moderate Dutch <b>English</b> <b>accent...</b>|$|R
