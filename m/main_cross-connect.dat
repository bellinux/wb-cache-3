5000|$|ANSI/TIA-568-D {{defines a}} {{hierarchical}} cable system architecture, {{in which a}} <b>main</b> <b>cross-connect</b> (MCC) is connected via a star topology across backbone cabling to intermediate cross-connects (ICC) and horizontal cross-connects (HCC). Telecommunications design traditions utilized a similar topology. Many people refer to cross-connects by their telecommunications names: [...] "distribution frames" [...] (with the various hierarchies called MDFs, IDFs and wiring closets). Backbone cabling {{is also used to}} interconnect entrance facilities (such as telco demarcation points) to the <b>main</b> <b>cross-connect.</b> Maximum allowable backbone fibre distances vary between 300m and 3000m, depending upon the cable type and use.|$|E
5000|$|Backbone cabling is the inter-building and intra-building cable {{connections}} in structured cabling between entrance facilities, equipment rooms and telecommunications closets. Backbone cabling {{consists of the}} transmission media, <b>main</b> and intermediate <b>cross-connects</b> and terminations at these locations. This system is mostly used in data centers.|$|R
40|$|What is Data Cabling? A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include channel equipment (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC adapter wires, fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and <b>main</b> <b>cross-connects,</b> and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or intermediate cross connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to joining hardware such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider. Why a Business Needs a Cabling Structure Without the right network installation and data infrastructure, a company {{would not be able to}} operate or compete in the marketplace. Today, most businesses operate using a data network system to help process transactions, store and handle sensitive information, conduct daily business operations, manage accounting and money, employee tracking and payroll, along with business email and hosting services...|$|R
