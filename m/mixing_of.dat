Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942.

5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals. Enriched lower crust and upper mantle might also contribute. Finally, the <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> magma chamber contents with new and more mafic magma shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified magma chamber, with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper contents and hotter and denser lower contents.|$|E

5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. <b>Mixing</b> <b>of</b> the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E
