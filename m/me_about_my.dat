500|$|Thomas {{included}} Piz dancing humorously at {{the fraternity}} party because he [...] "could watch {{it over and}} over", and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing. The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} final output, and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask <b>Me</b> <b>About</b> <b>My</b> STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, and I now have one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac a whiskey, he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} edit of {{the music}} video begins with a message to those fans that sent in their videos; [...] "Thank you {{to all those who}} chose to share their stories with the world." [...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the sofa, with tears in her eyes, as they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E
500|$|As {{the club}} {{continued}} {{its attempts to}} terminate Kinkladze's contract, he trained with the reserve team up to 29 September 2002, missing Derby's first five matches of the 2002–03 season. He was {{brought back to the}} first team following two defeats, introduced as a substitute after an hour's stalemate against Stoke City on 31 August. His introduction proved crucial in turning the game into a 2–0 win for Derby, as he took part in the build-up of both goals. He then missed a number of matches through injuries, featuring in around half of Derby's games in the remainder of 2002. In October 2002, Georgian national team manager Aleksandr Chivadze unexpectedly omitted Kinkladze and captain Georgi Nemsadze from the team for their match against Russia, causing a stir in Georgia. Kinkladze, surprised and disappointed, said: [...] "When I was out of form, he constantly phoned me, asked <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> play and called me to the team. Now I'm fit, scoring goals, but he didn't call me and even didn't phone." [...] Both Kinkladze and Nemsadze returned to the starting line-up for the next European Championship qualifying match on against Ireland. By January, because of the financial crisis at Derby, Kinkladze had not been paid for more than three months. He intended to quit, but although his agent admitted interest from German side Hamburg and a second enquiry from Galatasaray, no move transpired and he remained at the club. He played for Derby more often {{in the second half of}} the season, and his form resulted in him being named the supporters Player of the Year. Derby finished the season in the bottom half of the table, and needed to reduce costs for the next season as their Premier League parachute payments had ended. As a result, Derby offered Kinkladze a one-year contract, but on a wage one third of that of his previous contract. Kinkladze decided to turn down this contract extension proposal, desiring a move to a more successful club with a chance of winning trophies. To this end, he held talks with Liverpool in May 2003. As contract negotiations with Derby did not reach a positive conclusion, Kinkladze left the club.|$|E

2500|$|... "Panic" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} the Smiths, {{released}} in 1986 and written by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. The first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon, [...] "Panic" [...] bemoans the state of contemporary pop music which [...] "says nothing to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> life", and exhorts listeners to [...] "burn down the disco" [...] and [...] "hang the DJ" [...] in retaliation. The song was released by Rough Trade as a single and reached No. 7 on the Irish Singles Chart and No. 11 in the UK Chart. Morrissey considered the song's appearance on daytime British radio a [...] "tiny revolution" [...] in its own way, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{begins with}} Morrissey {{mentioning}} chaos unravelling throughout Britain and Ireland (specifically naming the locales as London, Birmingham, Grasmere, Carlisle, Leeds, Dublin, Dundee, and Humberside). In {{the second part}} of the song, he reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music, which [...] "says nothing to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> life". In reaction, he implores listeners to [...] "burn down the disco" [...] and [...] "hang the DJ", the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Journalist Nick Kent described [...] "Panic" [...] as a mandate for [...] "rock terrorism". John Luerssen calls it a [...] "commentary on the tepid state of pop music in 1986" [...] and a [...] "chiming guitar song," [...] based around a rotation between the G and E minor chords. Simon Goddard has said it mimics [...] "Metal Guru" [...] by the glam rock band T.Rex. Luerssen calls the song Marr's homage to the T.Rex song.|$|E
