This is not compatible with most VGA monitors. A <b>Multisync</b> monitor {{is required for}} some higher resolutions. This connection can also be genlocked to an external video signal. An RF adapter (A520) was frequently bundled with the machine to provide output on regular televisions or on composite monitors. A digital 16 colour Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal is available too on the same connector.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{displays}} {{video in}} analog RGB [...] PAL or [...] NTSC through a proprietary DB23M connector and in NTSC mode the line frequency is [...] HSync for standard video modes, which {{is compatible with}} NTSC television and CVBS/RGB video, but out of range for most VGA-compatible monitors, while a <b>multisync</b> monitor is required {{for some of the}} higher resolutions. This connection can also be genlocked to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an RF adapter to provide output on televisions with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome composite video is available via an RCA connector (also coaxial). There is also a Zorro II bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's AutoConfig standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to [...] of “fast RAM" [...] can be added using the side expansion slot.|$|E
50|$|There {{were only}} three non-Tandy {{monitors}} that worked with the Tandy 2000 graphics card, {{all of which are}} long out of production. These were the original (1986-88) Mitsubishi Diamond Scan, and the Nippon Electronics Corporation (NEC) <b>Multisync</b> and <b>Multisync</b> GS (grayscale). The required horizontal scan frequency for the Tandy 2000 is 26.4 kHz. Modern flat-screen <b>multisync</b> computer monitors cannot sync at frequencies below 30 kHz. The CM-1 monitor is also digital RGB; all modern monitors are analog-only.|$|E
5000|$|Added {{support for}} {{extended}} EGA text and graphics modes (requires <b>multisync</b> monitor) ...|$|E
50|$|The 13W3 {{connector}} can {{be converted}} into a standard VGA connector using cables and adapters that are commonly available. This allows modern <b>multisync</b> monitors, which are common on today's computers, {{to be used with}} these workstations {{as long as they are}} sync-on-green compatible. Likewise, as many newer Sun monitors support <b>multisync,</b> similar cables can be used to connect them to modern computers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>MultiSync</b> is a {{trademark}} of NEC. Sony uses the name [...] "Multiscan" [...] instead, and Samsung uses [...] "SyncMaster".|$|E

5000|$|<b>MultiSync</b> {{is a free}} {{synchronization}} tool to synchronize PDAs, mobile telephones, {{and personal}} information manager software with each other. Development of the tool has largely halted, with attention focusing instead on the [...] OpenSync project.|$|E
50|$|The refresh {{frequency}} is 15 or 30 kHz HSync {{for standard}} Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most VGA monitors but usually with most Televisions. A <b>Multisync</b> monitor {{is required for}} some higher resolutions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multisync</b> monitor or multiscan monitor is {{a monitor}} that can {{properly}} synchronise with various {{horizontal and vertical}} scan frequencies. In contrast, fixed frequency monitors can only synchronise with a specific horizontal and vertical frequency, limiting their flexibility.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{carrying}} out synchronisations, Synkron provides many other additional features. The user interface of Synkron {{is divided into}} several sections: Synchronise, <b>Multisync,</b> SyncView, Scheduler, Restore, Blacklist and Filters. The user can switch between these sections by using the toolbar.|$|E
5000|$|... {{on board}} bit mapped colour {{graphics}} (no [...] "text" [...] mode), with timing {{provided by a}} Motorola 6845 CRT controller. The video could produce 320x200 in 16 colours, or 640x200 in a palette of 4 colours out of 16, with a later modification providing a 960x512 monochrome mode. The frame buffer resided in system memory and video refresh provided DRAM refresh cycles. The video output was able to drive CGA, EGA, MGA and <b>multisync</b> monitors.|$|E
5000|$|While common <b>multisync</b> CRT {{computer}} monitors have been capable of running at even multiples of 24 Hz {{since the early}} 1990s, recent [...] "120 Hz" [...] LCDs have been produced {{for the purpose of}} having smoother, more fluid motion, depending upon the source material, and any subsequent processing done to the signal. In the case of material shot on video, improvements in smoothness just from having a higher refresh rate may be barely noticeable.|$|E
50|$|OpenSync is an {{obsolete}} (or {{at least}} years-dormant) software library framework used for synchronization of PIM data (contacts, calendar, tasks, and notes) between personal computers and mobile devices. It {{is derived from}} <b>MultiSync.</b> OpenSync is plugin based and its product-specific plugins allow support {{for a wide variety}} of different synchronization endpoints (PIM applications, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, groupware servers, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories). Its design and implementation would allow other synchronization uses as well.|$|E
50|$|The Sega TeraDrive {{includes}} stereo RCA jacks and composite NTSC {{video output}} for {{connection to a}} TV, whereas the Mega PC lacks this feature, but could be connected to a PAL TV through SCART. Outputs from both the PC and Mega Drive units are available from a shared VGA connector, but since video output from the Mega Drive is still 15 kHz RGB it works fine when connected to a TV using SCART. When using the PC hardware, only a <b>Multisync</b> or VGA monitor can be used, as the unit outputs video at 31 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{receiving}} end, a digital display {{is free to}} independently present the image sequence at a multiple of its capture rate, thus reducing visible flicker. Most modern displays are [...] "multisync," [...] meaning that they can refresh the image display at a rate most suitable for the image sequence being presented. For example, a <b>multisync</b> display may support a range of vertical refresh rates from 50 to 72 Hz, or from 96 to 120 Hz, {{so that it can}} display all standard capture rates by means of an integer rate conversion.|$|E
5000|$|Analogue RGB 50 Hz PAL and 60 Hz NTSC video output, {{provided}} on an Amiga-specific DB23M video connector. Can drive video with 15,750 Hz HSync for standard Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most VGA monitors. A <b>Multisync</b> monitor {{is required for}} some higher resolutions. This connection can also be genlocked to an external video signal. An RF adapter (A520) was frequently bundled with the machine to provide output on regular televisions or on composite monitors. A digital 16 colour Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal is available too on the same connector.|$|E
50|$|XGA-2 added a 24-bit DAC, {{but this}} was used only to extend the {{available}} master palette in 256-color mode, e.g. to allow true 256-greyscale output instead of the 64 grey levels previously available; {{there was still no}} direct Truecolor mode despite the adaptor featuring enough default onboard VRAM (1 MB) to support it. Other improvements included provision of the previously missing 800×600 resolution (using an SVGA or <b>multisync</b> monitor) in up to 65,536 colors, faster screen refresh rates in all modes (including non-interlace, flicker-free output for 1024×768), and improved accelerator performance and versatility.|$|E
50|$|The Apple Macintosh {{system was}} {{originally}} {{designed so that}} the screen resolution and {{the resolution of the}} ImageWriter dot-matrix printers sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 DPI for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as MacWrite and MacPaint were easily translated to the printed output—if the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be {{the same size as the}} on screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the ImageWriter was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh 15 in monitor had the same 640 × 480 resolution as a PC, a 16 in screen would be fixed at 832 × 624 rather than the 800 × 600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as laser printers and <b>multisync</b> monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.|$|E
5000|$|According to Eric Peters, {{one of the}} company's founders, most prototypes of [...] "the Avid" [...] {{were built}} on Apollo workstations. At some point, Avid demo'd one of their {{products}} at Siggraph. Says Peters: [...] "Some Apple people saw that demo at the show and said, [...] "Nice demo. Wrong platform!" [...] It turned out they were evangelists for the then new Mac II (with *six* slots!). When {{we got back to}} our office (actually a converted machine shop) after the show, there was a pile of Fedex packages on our doorstep. They were from Apple, and they contained two of their prototype Mac II machines (so early they didn't even have cases, just open chassis). Also there were four large <b>multisync</b> monitors. Each computer was loaded with full memory (probably 4 megs at the time), and a full complement of Apple software (pre-Claris). That afternoon, a consultant knocked on our door saying, [...] "Hi. I'm being paid by Apple to come here and port your applications from Apollo to Macintosh." [...] He worked for us for several weeks, and actually taught us how to program the Macs." [...] At the time, Macs were not considered to be fast enough for video purposes. The Avid engineering team, however, managed to get 1,200 kBytes per second, which allowed them to do offline video on the Macs.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the lack}} of Amiga 2000-compatible {{internal}} expansion slots, there are many ports and expansion options. There are two DE9M Atari joystick ports for joysticks or mice, stereo audio (RCA connectors 1 V p-p). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to three extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector. The then-standard RS-232 serial port (DB25M) and Centronics parallel port (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is (+5V, +/-12V). The system displays video in analog RGB 50 Hz PAL or 60 Hz NTSC through a proprietary DB23M connector and in NTSC mode the line frequency is 15,750 Hz HSync for standard video modes, which is compatible with NTSC television and CVBS/RGB video, but out of range for most VGA-compatible monitors, while a <b>multisync</b> monitor is required {{for some of the}} higher resolutions. This connection can also be genlocked to an external video signal.

Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's AutoConfig standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to 8 MB of “fast RAM" [...] can be added using the side expansion slot.|$|E
40|$|The Cubetree Storage Organization (CSO) I logically and {{physically}} clusters materialized-views data, multi-dimensional indices on them, and computed aggregate values {{all in one}} compact and tight storage structure that uses {{a fraction of the}} conventional table-based space. This is a breakthrough technology for storing and accessing multi-dimensional data in terms of storage reduction, query performance and incre-mental bulk update speed. CS 0 has been extended with an Active <b>MultiSync</b> controller for synchronizing multiple con-current access and continuous asynchronous online updates for a non-stop data warehouse. 1 The CS 0 Concept The Relational On-Line Analytical Processing (RO-LAP) is emerging as the dominant approach in data warehousing. In order to enhance query performance, the ROLAP approach relies on selecting and materi-alizing in summary tables appropriate subsets of ag-gregate views which are then engaged in speeding up OLAP queries. However, a straight forward relational storage implementation of materialized ROLAP views is immensely wasteful on storage and incredibly inad-equate on query performance and incremental update speed. Cubetrees [RKR 97] are collections of packed and compressed R-trees and shown to be the best alternative for storing and indexing at the same time collections of ROLAP aggregate views.

40|$|Following on {{from the}} {{impressive}} development of the new HSBC Money Gallery in 1997, the British Museum has launched {{into the world of}} electronic publishing with the World of Money, an "interactive exploration of money worldwide from ancient times to the present day". Intended for ages ten to adult, the CD promises "a mine of information about the use, form, history and importance of money around the globe", and "fun and information for all the family". Reviewing in a Mac-unfriendly environment, I have been able to run the CD only on a PC. On a 166 Mhz MMX with 32 Mb RAM and a 12 x CD it runs impressively quickly, with no {{more than two or three}} seconds of the "loading new page" display when switching between different parts of the program. Minimum requirements are listed as a 486 with 8 Mb RAM, 40 Mb free hard disk space, Windows 3. 11 or Windows 95, 4 x CD drive, 1 Mb 256 colours graphics card, 16 -bit Sound Blaster compatible sound card, and a VGA monitor. Minimum requirements for the Mac are listed as System 7, 603 e processor, 16 Mb RAM, 40 MB free hard disk space, 6 x CD drive, 1 Mb video card and Apple monitor or <b>Multisync</b> with adaptor. The CD opens with an image of the British Museum portico, through which we are taken into the foyer, complete with the sound effects of massed ranks of tourists. We have four options available on a lectern, or by turning left, right or going upstairs: History of Money, Information Centre, Activities, and Options.

I built an analog very large-scale integration (VLSI) chip that learns in real-time. I have designed and tested this network in a 2 [ [...] . ] complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) process. The chip was fabricated through the Metal-Oxide-Silicon Implementation Service (MOSIS). This fabricated chip contains 12 neurons, each fully {{connected to the}} other 11 neurons, but with no self-feedback connection. The goal {{of this research is}} to build a supervised-learning neural-network VLSI chip. This neural chip could reside at a remote site unattended by a microcontroller, be battery operated, and be able to adapt autonomously to a changing environment. The neural chip has connection weights (or synapses) which are analog nonvolatile memories programmed in the presence of ultra-violet light. The chip consumes ultra-low power (less than one nW per synapse). Several other features of the chip distinguish it from previous work: the feedforward nonlinear mapping proceeds concurrently with the training process in real time; the weight modifications are performed in parallel and are calculated collectively as part of the network. I have successfully trained this chip to perform various mappings. The test mappings performed by the chip have two inputs and one output with four hidden units recruited by the network. The chip is presented with inputs and target outputs and proceeds to learn the mapping from input space to output space. Additional memory on the chip allows any or all of the input units to be enabled: similarly, the neurons can be configured as output units or hidden units. The weights, teaching signals, neuron outputs, error units, inputs, and target outputs can all be displayed on a <b>multisync</b> monitor to aid in debugging while the chip is being trained or run in feedforward mode. I show data of the chip learning...|$|E
