40|$|International audienceMultiple system atrophy is a fatal {{sporadic}} adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder with no symptomatic or disease-modifying treatment available. The cytopathological {{hallmark of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy is {{the accumulation of}} α-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Impaired insulin/insulin-like growth factor- 1 signalling (IGF- 1) and insulin resistance (i. e. decreased insulin/IGF- 1) {{have been reported in}} other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence also suggests impaired insulin/IGF- 1 signalling in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy, as corroborated by increased insulin and IGF- 1 plasma concentrations in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy patients and reduced IGF- 1 brain levels in a transgenic mouse model of <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy. We here tested the hypothesis that <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy is associated with brain insulin resistance and showed increased expression of the key downstream messenger insulin receptor substrate- 1 phosphorylated at serine residue 312 in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the putamen of patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy. Furthermore, the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1) phosphorylated at serine residue 312 was more apparent in inclusion bearing oligodendrocytes in the putamen. By contrast, it was not different between both groups in the temporal cortex, a less vulnerable structure compared to the putamen. These findings suggest that insulin resistance may occur in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy in regions where the neurodegenerative process is most severe and point to a possible relation between α-synuclein aggregates and insulin resistance. We also observed insulin resistance in the striatum of transgenic <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy mice and further demonstrate that the glucagon-like peptide- 1 analogue exendin- 4, a well-tolerated and Federal Drug Agency-approved antidiabetic drug, has positive effects on insulin resistance and monomeric α-synuclein load in the striatum, as well as survival of nigral dopamine neurons. Additionally, plasma levels of exosomal neural-derived IRS- 1 phosphorylated at serine residue 307 (corresponding to serine residue 312 in humans) negatively correlated with survival of nigral dopamine neurons in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy mice treated with exendin- 4. This finding suggests the potential for developing this peripheral biomarker candidate as an objective outcome measure of target engagement for clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide- 1 analogues in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy. In conclusion, our observation of brain insulin resistance in <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy patients and transgenic mice together with the beneficial effects of the glucagon-like peptide- 1 agonist exendin- 4 in transgenic mice paves the way for translating this innovative treatment into a clinical trial...|$|R

40|$|We used PET {{with the}} tracers [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), [18 F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) and [11 C]raclopride (RACLO) to study striatal glucose and dopa metabolism, and {{dopamine}} D 2 receptor binding, respectively, in nine patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy. Ten patients with classical Parkinson's disease were investigated {{with the same}} three PET tracers' and three separate groups, each of 10 healthy subjects, served as control populations. We found that striatal FDOPA values separated all healthy subjects from patients with parkinsonism {{but they were not}} useful in distinguishing <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy from Parkinson's disease. Conversely, striatal RACLO as well as FDG values discriminated all <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy from Parkinson's disease patients as well as from healthy control subjects. Metabolic and receptor binding decrements in the putamen of <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy patients were significantly correlated. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that a linear combination of putamen RACLO and FDOPA values accurately predicted clinical measures of disease severity in the <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy group. Our findings suggest that striatal FDG and particularly RACLO are sensitive and effective measures of striatal function and may help characterizing patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy.

40|$|Twenty-nine {{children}} 3 {{months to}} 17 {{years of age}} undergoing operations for congenital heart disease were included in this prospective study. Complement activation, activation of the plasma contact system, leukocytes, leukocyte elastase release, and C-reactive protein were studied during and after cardiopulmonary bypass for the first postoperative week and related to <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure occurring in eight (27. 5 %) of the 29 children. During cardiopulmonary bypass complement activation via the alternative pathway as indicated by significant conversion of C 3 (expressed by C 3 d/C 3) and abnormally high C 5 a values {{at the end of}} cardiopulmonary bypass without consumption of C 4 was shown in all children. At the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, C 3 conversion was significantly higher in the eight patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure than in the others (p < 0. 05), whereas no difference in C 5 a level was shown. All children had a significant increase in leukocyte count directly after protamine administration (p < 0. 0001) and elastase release during cardiopulmonary bypass that was significantly higher in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure than in those without (p < 0. 05). Consumption of prekallikrein as an indicator of activation of the Hageman system was not detectable during cardiopulmonary bypass in any child. After cardiopulmonary bypass, in patients without <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure, C 3 d/C 3 decreased and reached preoperative values within the first postoperative week, whereas, in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure, C 3 d/C 3 increased further, reaching a maximal value on the third postoperative day. In comparison with patients without <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure, patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure showed a severe decrease of C 4 (with minimal values on the third postoperative day), suggesting consumption by activation of the classic pathway of the complement system or a hepatic synthesis deficiency. Prekallikrein values were also significantly lower in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure than in the others, with a maximal difference on the third postoperative day (p < 0. 005). C-reactive protein was significantly lower in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure than in the others for the first 2 postoperative days (p < 0. 05), probably because of severe hepatic failure in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure. This study demonstrates that, in children, cardiopulmonary bypass induces complement activation principally via the alternative pathway. It suggests a relationship between complement activation and <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure observed in the postoperative period. Furthermore, it points out the role of <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> organ failure itself on the C 3 conversion and on the synthesis of the markers of the inflammatory response in children after heart operations.

40|$|Diffusion-weighted imaging {{has been}} largely used to detect and {{quantify}} early degenerative changes in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy, but progression of neurodegeneration has been poorly investigated. We performed a serial diffusion-weighted imaging study in a population of <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy patients and analyzed the evolution of diffusion properties in striatal and extrastriatal brain regions. Diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained in 11 <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy patients at baseline and after a follow-up of 11. 7 ± 1. 2 months, and Trace (D) changes in different brain regions were correlated with disease duration and severity. A significant increase in Trace (D) was observed at follow-up in the putamen (P <. 001), pons (P =. 003), cerebellar white matter (P =. 03), thalamus (P =. 013), and frontal white matter (P =. 021). Both Unified <b>Multiple</b> <b>System</b> Atrophy Rating Scale Part II and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores significantly increased at follow-up (P =. 003), but percent changes of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III and Unified <b>Multiple</b> <b>System</b> Atrophy Rating Scale Part II did not correlate with percent changes of Trace (D) values in any brain region.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether Parkinson's disease and <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy {{each has a}} distinct pattern of micturition abnormalities and whether a urodynamic evaluation could be useful in the differential diagnosis between the two diseases. METHODS: Sixty two patients (30 with Parkinson's disease and 32 with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy) underwent a complete urodynamic evaluation and neurophysiological testing. RESULTS: Of the parkinsonian patients 36. 6 % had normal micturition findings with normal bladder sensitivity; 26. 7 % had delayed or incomplete pelvic floor relaxation; 26. 7 % had hyperreflexia with vesicosphincteric synergy; and 10 % had hyperreflexia with vesicosphincteric synergy associated with incomplete pelvic floor relaxation. Parkinsonian patients with a normal urodynamic pattern had significantly less severe disease and a shorter duration of disease in years {{than those who had}} abnormal patterns. Patients with hyperreflexia had significantly higher severity of disease. All the patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy had hyperreflexia with synergy. Two urodynamic patterns were identified: hyperreflexia with vesicosphincteric synergy (90. 6 % of patients), and hyperreflexia with vesicosphincteric synergy and incomplete pelvic floor relaxation (in 9. 4 %). Hyperreflexia with synergy correlated neither with the severity nor with the duration of disease. Sphincter EMG analysis showed that all the parkinsonian patients had normal sphincter EMG whereas 24 of the 32 patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy had neurogenic signs. CONCLUSIONS: Urodynamic evaluation and sphincter EMG are both useful tests in the differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease and <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy.
