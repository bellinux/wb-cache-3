5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis.

Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary <b>metering</b> <b>rods</b> to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions.

50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a <b>metering</b> <b>rod</b> or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main metering jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|E

5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an air valve at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The air valve opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the air valve is linked to <b>metering</b> <b>rods</b> which are raised as the air valve opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites show {{outstanding}} performance and bulk-processing abilities compared to conventional composites {{since they are}} recyclable, lightweight, and effective even at low filler loading. In particular, organic nanofillers with a high aspect ratio and low density are interesting because of their uniform dispersion in a polymer matrix. This feature provides excellent matrix/filler interaction for improving the thermal/mechanical properties of polymer resins, leading to lighter, cheaper, more environmentally friendly, and sustainable nanocomposites. This is why there is growing interest in sustainable cellulose materials. Nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) {{can be found in}} the natural structure of cellulose fibers. These rod-like shaped nanoparticles, which have a high aspect ratio, are nearly defect-free, and they are renewable and biocompatible. In addition, CNCs are stiffer than Kevlar and their mechanical properties are comparable to other reinforcements, even those with a low density. However, there are limitations and drawbacks in CNC based materials, including: moisture uptake/swelling, agglomeration of nanoparticles, difficulty in redispersing agglomerated particles, and their incompatibility with hydrophobic polymers. To solve these drawbacks of CNCs, it is essential to increase their hydrophobicity. ^ One-pot synthesis for surface hydrophobization of CNCs was conducted by grafting PLA oligomers and fatty acids or their esters (biodiesel or plant oils). The key factor of this synthesis process in aqueous medium is the use of lactic acid, which is also a reactant of the hydrophobization synthesis and produces an intermediate product of polylactic acid oligomer grafted CNCs, as a solvent for the esterification of CNCs with acids or esters having a long hydrocarbon chain. It was shown that approximately one-third of all the available OH groups on the surface of CNCs were modified with the excess renewable materials which were recycled and reused as reactants in subsequent trials not only to decrease the environmental footprint of the product, but also to enhance economic feasibility. This modification level was enough to improve dispersibility in various organic solvents, such as acetonitrile, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, 1 -methoxy- 2 -propanol, and chloroform, without damaging the structural morphology and crystallinity of hCNCs. ^ Encapsulation technologies are widely used in a variety of applications (agrochemicals, cosmetics, food additives, ink/paints, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals); yet, protection and controlled release of core materials via conventional encapsulation methods remain relatively poor in many cases. At present, polymer composite membranes are extensively drawing attention as the upcoming alternative shell material. For the design and fabrication of mechanically robust microcapsules, polyurea-urethane (PU) composites containing hCNCs as an upcoming alternative shell material were developed through an in situ interfacial polymerization process. These nanostructured composite shells can be used to create a stable environment and allow phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage to undergo phase change without any outside influence. These microcapsules have high rigidity and maintain high strain tolerance. They also provide much better phase change and anti-osmotic behaviors, as well as, much clearer core-shell structures and higher encapsulation efficiencies than those of pure PU microcapsules. ^ Finally, nanocomposite wood coating materials were successfully prepared by adding hCNCs to tung oil (TO). The coating process of the hCNC-TO finish using a flat paint brush or <b>metering</b> <b>rod</b> to form composite coats on various substrates (glass/steel panels or polymer film), as well as, their topography, optical properties, mechanical properties, gas permeability, and coating performance was investigated in this study.

40|$|Abstract Purpose A cathode-ray-tube (CRT) monitor–based {{technique}} {{was used to}} isolate clinically significant components of dark adaptation. The utility of the technique in identifying adaptation abnormalities in eyes with age-related maculopathy (ARM) is described. Methods A CRT dark adaptometer was developed to assess cone and rod recovery after photopigment bleach. The following measures were obtained: cone recovery rate (R c; in decades per minute) and absolute threshold (Tf c; log candelas per square <b>meter),</b> <b>rod</b> recovery rate (R r; decades per minute), and rod–cone transition (rod–cone break [RCB], in minutes). These components were isolated by appropriately selecting stimulus size, stimulus location, pigment bleach, and test duration and by coupling the CRT with judiciously selected neutral-density (ND) filters. The protocol was developed by using 5 young observers and was tested on 27 subjects with ARM in the study eye and 22 age-matched control subjects. Results The parameters necessary for effective isolation of cone and early phase rod dark adaptation were a 2. 6 ND filter (for a standard CRT monitor, 0. 08 – 80 cd · m − 2 luminance output); a 4 ° foveated, 200 -ms, achromatic spot; ∼ 30 % pigment bleaching; and a 30 -minute test duration. These settings returned obvious rod and cone recovery curves in control and ARM eyes that were compatible with conventional test methods and identified 93 % of participants with ARM as having delayed dynamics {{in at least one}} of the parameters. Cone recovery dynamics were significantly slower in the ARM group when compared with age-matched control subjects (R c, 0. 99 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 63 ± 0. 61 decades · min − 1, P < 0. 0001). Three of the 27 eyes with ARM did not achieve RCB during the allowed duration (30 minutes). The remaining eyes with ARM (n = 24) exhibited a significant delay in rod recovery (R r, ARM, 0. 16 ± 0. 03 vs. controls, 0. 22 ± 0. 02 decades · min − 1, P < 0. 0001) and the average time to RCB (±SD) in the ARM group was significantly longer than in the control subjects (19. 12 ± 5. 17 minutes vs. 10. 40 ± 2. 49 minutes, P < 0. 0001). Conclusions The CRT dark-adaptation technique described in this article is an effective test for identifying abnormalities in cone and rod recovery. Slowed cone and rod recovery and a delayed RCB were evident in the eyes with ARM. The test method is potentially useful for clinical intervention trials in which ARM progression is monitored. </p...|$|R
