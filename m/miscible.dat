5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is <b>miscible</b> with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely <b>miscible,</b> and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very <b>miscible</b> with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely <b>miscible</b> as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
5|$|Sodium forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially <b>miscible</b> with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely <b>miscible</b> with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{can form}} alloys {{with many other}} metals. Addition of small {{proportions}} of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered {{as a way to}} store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium, and it is completely <b>miscible</b> in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is <b>miscible</b> with ethanol, acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully <b>miscible</b> with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is a {{versatile}} solvent, <b>miscible</b> {{with water and}} with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene. It is also <b>miscible</b> with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.|$|E
25|$|Dichloromethane (DCM, or {{methylene}} chloride) is {{an organic}} compound with the formula CH2Cl2. This colorless, volatile liquid with a moderately sweet aroma {{is widely used}} as a solvent. Although it is not <b>miscible</b> with water, it is <b>miscible</b> with many organic solvents. One of the most well-known applications of dichloromethane is in the drinking bird heat engine.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{slightly}} soluble in water (about 20mg⋅L−1), but <b>miscible</b> with organic solvents.|$|E
25|$|Their {{solubility}} in nonpolar solvents {{is relatively}} good, a property {{that is called}} lipophilicity. Different alkanes are, for example, <b>miscible</b> in all proportions among themselves.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic ethers such as {{tetrahydrofuran}} and 1,4-dioxane are <b>miscible</b> {{in water}} {{because of the}} more exposed oxygen atom for hydrogen bonding as compared to linear aliphatic ethers.|$|E
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is defined}} as distillation {{in the presence of}} a <b>miscible,</b> high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no azeotrope with the other components in the mixture.|$|E
25|$|Co{{distillation}} is distillation {{which is}} performed on mixtures {{in which the}} two compounds are not <b>miscible.</b> In the laboratory, the Dean-Stark apparatus is used for this purpose to remove water from synthesis products.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is hygroscopic. DL-lactic acid is <b>miscible</b> {{with water}} and with ethanol above its melting point which is around 17 or 18°C. D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a higher melting point.|$|E
25|$|Gases are soluble in {{superheated}} {{water at}} elevated pressures. Above the critical temperature, water is completely <b>miscible</b> with all gasses. The increasing solubility of oxygen in particular allows superheated water {{to be used}} for wet oxidation processes.|$|E
25|$|Although non-miscible, both LNAPLs and DNAPLs {{still have}} the {{potential}} to slowly dissolve into the aqueous (<b>miscible)</b> phase to create a plume and thus become a long-term source of contamination. DNAPLs (chlorinated solvents, heavy PAHs, creosote, PCBs) tend to be difficult to manage as they can reside very deep in the groundwater system.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{can display}} immiscibility. The most {{familiar}} mixture of two immiscible liquids {{in everyday life}} is the vegetable oil and water in Italian salad dressing. A familiar set of <b>miscible</b> liquids is water and alcohol. Liquid components in a mixture can often be separated from one another via fractional distillation.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is <b>miscible</b> {{with water}} and is a good general purpose solvent. It is found in paints, tinctures, markers, and {{personal}} care products such as mouthwashes, perfumes and deodorants. However, polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of DNA and RNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{solubility}} ranges widely, from infinitely soluble (without limit) (fully <b>miscible)</b> such as ethanol in water, to poorly soluble, such as silver chloride in water. The term insoluble is often applied to poorly or very poorly soluble compounds. A common threshold to describe something as insoluble {{is less than}} 0.1 g per 100 mL of solvent.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{hydroxyl}} group makes the alcohol molecule polar. Those groups can form hydrogen bonds {{to one another}} and to other compounds (except in certain large molecules where the hydroxyl is protected by steric hindrance of adjacent groups). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as protic solvents. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are <b>miscible</b> in water because the {{hydroxyl group}} wins out over the short carbon chain. Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as pentanol and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are <b>miscible</b> in organic solvents.|$|E
25|$|As a {{petroleum}} product <b>miscible</b> with many industrial liquids, kerosene {{can be used}} as both a solvent, able to remove other {{petroleum product}}s, such as chain grease, and as a lubricant, with less risk of combustion when compared to using gasoline. It can also be used as a cooling agent in metal production and treatment (oxygen-free conditions).|$|E
25|$|As many {{as eight}} {{immiscible}} liquid phases have been observed. Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely <b>miscible,</b> e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases.|$|E
25|$|THF {{has been}} {{explored}} as a <b>miscible</b> co-solvent {{in aqueous solution}} {{to aid in the}} liquefaction and delignification of plant lignocellulosic biomass for production of renewable platform chemicals and sugars as potential precursors to biofuels. Aqueous THF augments the hydrolysis of glycans from biomass and dissolves the majority of biomass lignin making it a suitable solvent for biomass pretreatment.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} is <b>miscible</b> {{with water}} (dissolves in any proportion), {{whereas the other}} hydrogen halides have large solubility gaps with water. Hydrogen fluoride and water also form several compounds in the solid state, most notably a 1:1 compound that does not melt until −40°C (−40°F), which is 44°C (79°F) above the melting point of pure HF.|$|E
25|$|Solvent properties: Ammonia is <b>miscible</b> with water. In an aqueous solution, {{it can be}} {{expelled}} by boiling. The aqueous solution of ammonia is basic. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a saturated solution) has a density of 0.880 g/cm3 and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain combustion, except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air.|$|E
25|$|DMF is <b>miscible</b> with water. The vapour {{pressure}} at 20°C is 3.5hPa. A Henry's law constant of 7.47×10−5hPam3mol1 can be deduced from an experimentally determined equilibrium constant at 25°C. The partition coefficient logPOW is measured to −0.85. Since {{the density of}} DMF (0.95gcm3 at 20°C) {{is similar to that}} of water, significant flotation or stratification in surface waters in case of accidental losses is not expected.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparing}} tissues for histology or histopathology, d-limonene {{is often}} used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids <b>miscible</b> with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. In traditional medicine, d-limonene is marketed to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine is <b>miscible</b> {{with water}} and {{virtually}} all organic solvents. It is weakly basic, and with hydrochloric acid it forms a crystalline hydrochloride salt that melts at 145–147°C. Most chemical properties of pyridine are typical of a heteroaromatic compound. In organic reactions, pyridine behaves both as a tertiary amine, undergoing protonation, alkylation, acylation, and N-oxidation at the nitrogen atom, and as an aromatic compound, undergoing nucleophilic substitutions.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{polymeric}} mixtures are {{far less}} <b>miscible</b> than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results {{from the fact that}} the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, <b>miscible</b> materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less favorable. Thus, concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules.|$|E
25|$|Methanol {{is readily}} {{biodegradable}} in both aerobic (oxygen present) and anaerobic (oxygen absent) environments. Methanol will not {{persist in the}} environment. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives {{in the hundreds of}} days (such as benzene at 10–730 days). Since methanol is <b>miscible</b> with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.|$|E
25|$|When one {{substance}} is dissolved into another, a solution is formed. This {{is opposed to}} the situation when the compounds are insoluble like sand in water. In a solution, all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. A solvent-solute mixture consists of a single phase with all solute molecules occurring as solvates (solvent-solute complexes), as opposed to separate continuous phases as in suspensions, emulsions {{and other types of}} non-solution mixtures. The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as solubility; if this occurs in all proportions, it is called <b>miscible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Formic acid is a colorless liquid {{having a}} pungent, {{penetrating}} odor at room temperature. It is <b>miscible</b> {{with water and}} most polar organic solvents, and is somewhat soluble in hydrocarbons. In hydrocarbons and in the vapor phase, it consists of hydrogen-bonded dimers rather than individual molecules. Owing to its tendency to hydrogen-bond, gaseous formic acid does not obey the ideal gas law. Solid formic acid (two polymorphs) consists of an effectively endless network of hydrogen-bonded formic acid molecules. This relatively complicated compound also forms a low-boiling azeotrope with water (22.4%) and liquid formic acid also tends to supercool.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{the natural}} gas which was {{recovered}} {{in the course of}} recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring. Flaring is now illegal in many countries. Additionally, higher demand in the last 20–30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re-ed into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as <b>miscible</b> or immiscible flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of different}} species in imidazolium ionic liquids depends mainly on polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. Saturated aliphatic compounds are generally only sparingly soluble in ionic liquids, whereas olefins show somewhat greater solubility, and aldehydes can be completely <b>miscible.</b> This can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as hydrogenation and hydrocarbonylation processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with carbon dioxide gas showing exceptional solubility in many ionic liquids. Carbon monoxide is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen {{is only slightly}} soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids. Different analytical techniques have yielded somewhat different absolute solubility values.|$|E
25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is <b>miscible</b> with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E
25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} has a trigonal pyramidal {{shape as}} {{predicted by the}} valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one {{lone pair of electrons}}. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone electron pair, which makes ammonia a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly <b>miscible</b> with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are protonated. Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH4+. The latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane.|$|E
