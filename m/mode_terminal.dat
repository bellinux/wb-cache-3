50|$|A block-oriented {{terminal}} or block <b>mode</b> <b>terminal</b> {{is a type}} {{of computer}} terminal that communicates with its host in blocks of data, as opposed to a character-oriented terminal that communicates with its host one character at a time. The IBM 3270 is perhaps the most familiar implementation of a block-oriented terminal, but most mainframe computer manufacturers and several other companies produced them.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the concept <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode,</b> which is a {{recently}} developed standard by Nokia and Consumer Electronics for Automotive for connecting mobile phones to displays and input devices. The concept aims to be an industry standard for integration of mobile applications with the car environment. The master thesis project will implement a <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> client and the report will deal with the different parts needed to create a <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> client. <b>Terminal</b> <b>mode</b> is capable of using different physical transport methods but in this report only USB is considered, {{the reason for this}} was that the not fully developed <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> server prototype phone provided by Nokia only supported USB. FPS measurements were made but the results were not satisfying because there was a limitation in the prototype device. The report ends with a deep analysis of the standard. The analysis main focus is on security mechanisms in the protocol but also other systems with the same purpose as <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> is analyzed and compared. The outcome of the analysis was that <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> is secure if the security mechanisms are used correctly and that <b>Terminal</b> <b>Mode</b> can become a leading standard for enabling apps in the car. The big question is if car manufacturers will trust the classification of applications made by the smartphone manufacturers and if the customers want to pay for these features...|$|R

50|$|Though {{punctuation}} and the alphanumeric symbols can {{be considered}} standard in most text modes, many of them contain additional symbols and variant attributes (colours, blinking, lines / columns per screen, etc.) that differ between operating environments: the text mode of a Commodore 64 would be substantially {{different from that of}} an IBM PC, though despite an absence of standardization in the text display (until implementation of later text <b>mode</b> <b>terminal</b> display standards such as VT100 and ANSI), they would both be considered to be text modes. These later standards also contain numerous characters, largely blocks and lines, specifically intended to be used for fast, low-bandwidth display of crude block graphics in the text mode.|$|E
40|$|In {{a hybrid}} (terrestrial + satellite) mobile {{personal}} communications networks environment, a large size satellite footprint (supercell) overlays {{on a large}} number of smaller size, contiguous terrestrial cells. We assume that the users have either a terrestrial only single <b>mode</b> <b>terminal</b> (SMT) or a terrestrial/satellite dual <b>mode</b> <b>terminal</b> (DMT) and the ratio of DMT to the total terminals is defined gamma. It is assumed that the call assignments to and handovers between terrestrial cells and satellite supercells take place in a dynamic fashion when necessary. The objectives of this paper are twofold, (1) to propose and define a class of traffic sharing algorithms to manage terrestrial and satellite network resources efficiently by handling call handovers dynamically, and (2) to analyze and evaluate the algorithms by maximizing the traffic load handling capability (defined in erl/cell) over a wide range of terminal ratios (gamma) given an acceptable range of blocking probabilities. Two of the algorithms (G & S) in the proposed class perform extremely well {{for a wide range of}} gamma...|$|E

50|$|Different {{computer}} {{operating systems}} require {{different degrees of}} <b>mode</b> support when <b>terminals</b> are used as computer terminals. The POSIX terminal interface, as provided by Unix and POSIX-compliant operating systems, does not accommodate block-mode terminals at all, and only rarely requires the terminal itself to be in line-at-a-time mode, since the operating system is required to provide canonical input <b>mode,</b> where the <b>terminal</b> device driver in the operating system emulates local echo in the terminal, and performs line editing functions at the host end. Most usually, and especially so that the host system can support non-canonical input <b>mode,</b> <b>terminals</b> for POSIX-compliant systems are always in character-at-a-time mode. In contrast, IBM 3270 terminals connected to MVS systems are always required to be in block mode.|$|R

Smaller velocities of sulfate aerosols, median r = 0. 5 micron, are compatible with major growth in 2 to 3 months at 27 to 28 km.

40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans gene gld- 1 is {{essential}} for oocyte development; in gld- 1 (null) hermaphrodites, a tumor forms where oogenesis would normally occur. We use genetic epistasis analysis to demonstrate that tumor formation {{is dependent on the}} sexual fate of the germline. When the germline sex determination pathway is set in the female <b>mode</b> (<b>terminal</b> fem/fog genes inactive), gld- 1 (null) germ cells exit meiotic prophase and proliferate to form a tumor, but when the pathway is set in the male mode, they develop into sperm. We conclude that the gld- 1 (null) phenotype is cell-type specific and that gld- 1 (+) acts {{at the end of the}} cascade to direct oogenesis. We also use cell ablation and epistasis analysis to examine the dependence of tumor formation on the glp- 1 signaling pathway. Although glp- 1 activity promotes tumor growth, it is not essential for tumor formation by gld- 1 (null) germ cells. These data also reveal that gld- 1 (+) plays a nonessential (and sex nonspecific) role in regulating germ cell proliferation before their entry into meiosis. Thus gld- 1 (+) may negatively regulate proliferation at two distinct points in germ cell development: before entry into meiotic prophase in both sexes (nonessential premeiotic gld- 1 function) and during meiotic prophase when the sex determination pathway is set in the female mode (essential meiotic gld- 1 function) ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of text mode {{is that it}} has relatively low bandwidth requirements in remote terminal use. Thus, a text <b>mode</b> remote <b>terminal</b> can necessarily update the screen much faster than a graphics <b>mode</b> remote <b>terminal</b> linked to the same amount of bandwidth (and in turn will seem more responsive), since the remote server may only need to transmit a few dozen bytes for each screen update in text mode, as opposed to complex raster graphics remote procedure calls that may require the transmission and rendering of entire bitmaps.|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{work has}} been devoted to {{studying}} exible computation structures for the physical layer of a software de ned radio (SDR) terminal. However there has been al-most no research on protocol processors for the upper layer protocols such as the media access control (MAC) and link protocol. A general purpose processor (GPP) is sucient for the protocol processing of a single <b>mode</b> <b>terminal.</b> How-ever, {{in the case of a}} multi-mode system required for SDR, there is a very wide set of possibilities for the MAC layer. In principle these too could be handled by a GPP. However, we show that a better solution is to use a GPP augmented by a small supplemental processor. The GPP is responsi-ble for the relatively complex protocol operations in the ac-tive mode, and the supplemental processor handles the idle mode operations. This separation of responsibilities simpli-es the implementation of hard real-time responses required by some protocols (for example IEEE 802. 11), while main-taining the programmability needed to handle a wide range of protocols. In addition, this organization allows a signif-icant power savings in the idle mode. This is important because the protocol processor must process a large num-ber of tiny idle mode tasks whose aggregate eect over time dominates the power consumption in a wireless terminal. As part of our study we develop a hardware model of the supplemental processor in Verilog and its software model in C. Using commercial CAD tools we synthesized out design and evaluated the power consumption and response time of the platform. Our results show that the proposed platform meets the real-time deadlines at low power while maintain-ing programmability...|$|E
40|$|The {{historic}} {{arguments for}} {{the participation of}} eukaryotic DNA replication in the control of gene expression are reconsidered along with more recent evidence. An earlier view in which gene commitment was achieved with stable chromatin structures which required DNA replication to reset expression potential (D. D. Brown, Cell 37 : 359 - 365, 1984) is further considered. The participation of nonspecific stable repressor of gene activity (histones and other chromatin proteins), as previously proposed, is reexamined. The possible function of positive trans-acting factors is now further developed by considering evidence from DNA virus models. It is proposed that these positive factors act to control the initiation of replicon-specific DNA synthesis in the S phase (early or late replication timing). Stable chromatin assembles during replication into potentially active (early S) or inactive (late S) states with prevailing trans-acting factors (early) or repressing factors (late) and may asymmetrically commit daughter templates. This suggests logical schemes for programming differentiation based on replicons and trans-acting initiators. This proposal requires that DNA replication precede major changes in gene commitment. Prior evidence against a role for DNA replication during terminal differentiation is reexamined along with other results from terminal differentiation of lower eukaryotes. This leads to a proposal that DNA replication may yet underlie terminal gene commitment, but that for it to do so there must exist two distinct modes of replication control. In one mode (mitotic replication) replicon initiation is tightly linked to the cell cycle, whereas the other <b>mode</b> (<b>terminal</b> replication) initiation is not cell cycle restricted, is replicon specific, {{and can lead to}} a terminally differentiated state. Aberrant control of mitotic and terminal modes of DNA replication may underlie the transformed state. Implications of a replicon basis for chromatin structure-function and the evolution of metazoan organisms are considered...|$|E
