Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Master {{cylinder}} is {{a component}} of hydraulic braking system {{and it is just}} a simple piston inside a <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the key element of braking system which initiates and controls the braking action. A reservoir is attached to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> to store brake fluid. A <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> having a reservoir and a cylinder formed from a single piece of molded material. The objective of the present work is to minimize the weight to increase mileage in case of general road cars and to increase the speed of the vehicle in case of sports cars. Saving grams at different parts in a car helps us in saving some kilograms {{at the end of the}} design. The plastics have good elastic properties and are strong enough to use for <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The use of plastics in the manufacturing of <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> reduces the weight of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is modeled in PRO-E and the analysis is carried using ANSYS work bench. The automobile components like <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be easily modeled in PRO-E and can be easily analyzed using ANSYS...|$|R
50|$|The {{diameter}} {{and length of}} the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the performance of the brake system. A larger diameter <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> delivers more hydraulic fluid to the caliper pistons, yet requires more brake pedal force and less brake pedal stroke to achieve a given deceleration. A smaller diameter <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has the opposite effect.|$|R
50|$|As piston(s) {{move along}} the bore of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> this {{movement}} is transferred through the hydraulic fluid, {{to result in}} a movement of the slave cylinder(s). The hydraulic pressure created by moving a piston (inside the bore of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder)</b> toward the slave cylinder(s) compresses the fluid evenly, but by varying the comparative surface-area of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and/or each slave cylinder, one can vary the amount of force and displacement applied to each slave cylinder, relative to the amount of force and displacement applied to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{execute the}} {{functioning}} and biasing of force acting on two <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> using single brake pedal a mechanical system, i. e., balance bar is used {{which is designed}} to divide the force applied by the driver on the brake pedal to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Moreover in <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> pushrod’s movement is critical for proper functioning of <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> So to achieve linear motion correct position and orientation of brake pedal and pushrod mounting is required. After motion analysis and practical examination it is shown how to decide the mounting’s of pushrod...|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is located}} behind the driver’s side {{dashboard}} {{mounted on the}} vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder).</b>|$|R
50|$|Different {{vehicles}} {{have different}} bleeding patterns. Brakes are usually bled {{starting with the}} wheel that is furthest from the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and working towards the wheel closest to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1.6 DOHC {{versions}} were {{equipped with}} 256mm front brake rotors and 22mm <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{rather than the}} 236mm disks and 20mm <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> found on the other versions with the less power engines.|$|R

50|$|In a four-wheel car, the FMVSS Standard 105, 1976; {{requires}} that the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> be divided internally into two sections, each of which pressurizes a separate hydraulic circuit. Each section supplies pressure to one circuit. The combination {{is known as a}} dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Passenger vehicles typically have either a front/rear split brake system or a diagonal split brake system (the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a motorcycle or scooter may only pressurize a single unit, which will be the front brake).|$|R
5000|$|The alloy wheels were spoked {{and wore}} tubed tyres. The front brake had twin 230 mm disks and ATE callipers; the rear brake was a 200 mm SLS drum. The R90S {{and the other}} BMW [...] "/6" [...] series front brakes had an unusual system whereby a <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> on the top frame tube was {{activated}} by a cable from the front brake lever.

50|$|Roberts searched {{and found}} a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, which was {{perfectly}} suited for the Testarossa body pieces. The Pantera was rigidly modified to withstand the duties of filming. It was raised 1.5 inches for additional ground clearance, 2.5 inch wall-thick square tubing was used to prevent potential roof buckling and added a reinforcing railing {{that doubles as a}} skid plate, an auxiliary braking system designed to assist drivers in controlled spins, the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was repositioned in the brake line to enable it to feed the rear wheels enabling the driver to lock the aft end on command, and the auxiliary <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> utilizes the original <b>master</b> <b>cylinder's</b> reservoir and is installed in series with the outlet of the original <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> port leading to the rear wheels. When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration. He also replaced the carburetor replacing the stock with a Predator which reduces fuel lag. A Modine all-aluminum four-core radiator was used to guard against Miami's hot weather, and liquid Auto-Meter gauges to monitor the temperature.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic brakes {{transfer}} {{energy to}} stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In {{a very simple}} brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders. The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The cylinder that the operator uses is called the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The spinning disc brake will be adjacent to the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose {{the diameter of the}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is half the diameter of the slave <b>cylinder,</b> so the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has a cross-section four times smaller. Now, if the piston in the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is pushed down 40 mm, the slave piston will move 10 mm. If 10 newtons (N) of force are applied to the master piston, the slave piston will press with a force of 40 N.|$|R

5000|$|A {{brake booster}} is an {{enhanced}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> setup {{used to reduce}} the amount of pedal pressure needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> to give higher hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a brake booster push-rod. The brake booster usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force applied by the pedal on to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it. Without the engine running the brake pedal feels very hard and ineffective on the braking capability. An [...] "active" [...] booster is a non [...] "conventional" [...] booster where a solenoid is used to open the booster air valve to automatically push the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> forward to perform some forms of dynamic stability control. Brake boosters come in either a single diaphragm or tandem diaphragm (which is generally used for bigger vehicles and trucks). They can be [...] "cabin-breathers" [...] (taking clean filtered air from inside the cabin thus may be more noisy) or [...] "engine-breathers" [...] (less noisy but more at risk for becoming clogged with mud/ice if not protected properly).|$|R
