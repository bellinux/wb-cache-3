5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E

Most flowers are green; large and showy flowers are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, {{are unlikely to be}} present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. In {{the view of the}} historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan is said to have prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E

I also very <b>much</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> they are continuing to examine the logistics of exactly {{what would happen in}} a situation like this. Interestingly, no one has yet suggested mandatory birth control, but we do see discussions {{about the fact that the}} entire medical industry would have to change from a life-saving position to one that’s more about pain management.|$|R
5|$|In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{traveled}} {{thousands of}} miles across central North America {{in an attempt to}} map and explore the Louisiana Territory of the United States and the Oregon Country, which were then occupied mainly by Native Americans and settlers from Great Britain. As the expedition traveled down and back up the Columbia River, it missed the mouth of the Willamette, one of the Columbia's largest tributaries. It was only after receiving directions from natives along the Sandy River that the explorers learned about their oversight. William Clark returned down the Columbia and entered the Willamette River in April 1806. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Willamette Valley in 1841 while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail. The expedition members noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow {{to the principle of}} States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|The mafic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of thin mafic lava flows on an eroded surface. Successive eruptions sent lava pouring in all directions from central vents, forming a broad, gently sloping volcano of flat, domical shape, with a profile <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a warrior's shield. Alkali basalts and ankaramites were the primary lavas produced during this stage of activity which, due to their low silica content, were able to travel great distances away from their source. These lavas also erupted from vents on the flanks of the volcano. Blocky 'a'a and ropy pāhoehoe flows characterized the fluid and effusive nature of volcanism at Level Mountain during the mafic shield-building stage.|$|E

5000|$|Schan is {{the only}} artist named by Gessner; he painted most of the bird {{illustrations}} for his bird volume, together by Gessner's account with some descriptive text. The illustrations (not all by Schan) were so <b>much</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> they were brought out in a volume of their own in 1560, Icones Animalium. Authors such as Ilaria Mazzoleni state without evidence that Schan made most of the illustrations of animals throughout the Historia. Springer and Kinzelbach provide a slightly different quote from Gessner praising Schan: ...|$|R

5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose {{represented}} a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though {{the introduction of}} guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, {{they needed to be}} placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the Mary Rose was built. This made broadsides, coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible {{for the first time in}} history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.|$|E
