50|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostoses (HME), {{also called}} hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> (HMO), {{is a condition}} that is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 individuals. Multiple benign or noncancerous bone tumors develop in the affected individuals. The number and location vary among affected patients. Most people seem unaffected at birth; however, {{by the age of}} 12 years, they develop multiple exostoses.|$|E
50|$|Most {{examples}} of radioulnar synostosis are isolated (non-syndromic). Syndromes {{that may be}} accompanied by radioulnar synostosis include X chromosome polyploidy (e.g., XXXY) and other chromosome disorders (e.g., 4p- syndrome, Williams syndrome), acrofacial dysostosis, Antley-Bixler syndrome, genitopatellar syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> (hereditary multiple exostoses), limb-body wall complex, and Nievergelt syndrome.Craniosynostosis (from cranio, cranium; + syn, together; + ostosis relating to bone) is {{a condition in which}} {{one or more of the}} fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification). Craniosynostosis has following kinds: scaphocephaly, trigonocephaly, plagiocephaly, anterior plagiocephaly, posterior plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, oxycephaly, pansynostosis.|$|E

Malignant transformation is their most severe complication. However, deformities and interference with major joint function are the most frequent complaints in patients with hereditary mul-tiple osteochondroma. Treatment should therefore aim not only at surgical resection of the masses but also at prevention of deformities.

40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} osteochondromatosis (HMO) {{is characterized}} by <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondroma</b> (OC) arising from enchondrally formed bones. Such lesions are seen most commonly in the forearm, knee and hip joint. In long bones,OC arises adjacent to the physis and tends {{to remain in the}} metaphyseal legion. Therefore,it is rare that OC is located intra-articular of the joint and only few cases of intra-articular OC have been previously reported. Intra-articular OC could appear as a single loose body in a joint cavity. Thus,other joint disorders,such as osteochondritis dissecans should be ruled out in such cases. We herein report a case with an intra-articular OC in a knee joint cavity in the patient with HMO. 遺伝性多発性外骨腫症は，前腕，膝，股関節周囲などに多発する骨軟骨腫を特徴とする疾患である．多くの症例で，骨軟骨腫は長管骨の骨幹端近傍に存在し，関節内発生例の報告は少ない．今回，骨軟骨腫を膝関節内に発生した遺伝性多発性外骨腫症の希な１例を経験したため報告する...|$|R

50|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome vary widely. In addition to <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and enlarged parietal foramina, affected individuals often have intellectual disability and delayed development of speech, motor skills (such as sitting and walking), and social skills. Many people with this condition have distinctive facial features, which can include a wide, short skull (brachycephaly); a prominent forehead; a narrow bridge of the nose; a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum); and a downturned mouth. Less commonly, Potocki-Shaffer syndrome causes vision problems, additional skeletal abnormalities, and defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.|$|E
5000|$|Osteochondromas or osteocartilaginous exostoses are {{the most}} common benign tumors of the bones.The tumors take the form of cartilage-capped bony {{projections}} or outgrowth on the surface of bones (exostoses). It is characterized as a type of overgrowth that can occur in any bone where cartilage forms bone. Tumors most commonly affect long bones in the leg, pelvis, or scapula (shoulder blade). Development of osteochondromas take place during skeletal growth between the ages of 13 and 15 and ceases when the growth plate fuses at puberty. They arise within the first three decades of life affecting children and adolescents.Osteochondromas occur in 3% of the general population and represent 35% of all benign tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. Majority of these tumors are solitary non-hereditary lesions and approximately 15% of osteochondromas occur as hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> (HMOs). They can occur as a solitary lesion (solitary osteochondroma) or multiple lesions {{within the context of the}} same bone (Multiple Osteochondroma). [...] Osteochondromas do not result from injury and the exact cause remains unknown. Recent research has indicated that <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line Mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease.The treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{are normal}} at birth and the {{syndrome}} manifests during childhood and puberty. The enchondromas affect the extremities and their distribution is asymmetrical. The most common sites of enchondromas are the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the hands. The feet are less commonly afflicted.Disfigurations of the extremities are a result. Pathological fractures can arise in affected metaphyses and diaphyses {{of the long}} bones and are common (26%).The risk for sarcomatous degeneration of enchondromas, hemangiomas, or lymphangiomas is 15-30% {{in the setting of}} Maffucci syndrome. Maffucci syndrome is associated with a higher risk of CNS, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies. Multiple enchondromas may present in 3 disorders: Ollier disease, Maffucci syndrome, and metachondromatosis. It is important to make the distinction between these diseases, particularly Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome. Ollier disease is more common than Maffucci syndrome, and presents with multiple enchondromas often in a unilateral distribution. However, hemangiomas and lymphangiomas are not seen in Ollier disease. Metachondromatosis demonstrates autosomal-dominant transmission and presents with both <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and enchondromas.|$|E
30|$|Masses and mass-like lesions {{related to}} various {{developmental}} and genetic conditions {{can affect the}} developing craniofacial skeleton. The majority of masses and mass-like conditions of developmental/genetic origin are benign. Some of these conditions, such as torus palatinus and torus mandibularis, require no treatment other than alleviation of parental anxiety. Other conditions affecting the developing craniofacial skeleton, such as fibrous dysplasia, ossifying fibroma, familial gigantiform cementoma, cemento-osseous dysplasia, hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondroma</b> or plexiform neurofibroma, may cause functional impairments due to the proximity to important neurovascular structures, organs of special senses and developing dentition. Cosmetic deformities, due to the lesion itself or due to treatment-related asymmetric facial growth, may cause a significant psychosocial impact on the patient’s life. Management of these patients, therefore, often requires close interdisciplinary work-up, precise and often complex treatment planning strategies and post-treatment surveillance into adulthood. Radiologists, {{as part of an}} interdisciplinary team, {{play an important role in}} the management of these young patients. In addition, as these rare lesions may mimic neoplasms of the craniofacial skeleton and vice versa, it is imperative to be aware of their characteristic imaging features in order to avoid unnecessary biopsy and expensive follow-up examinations.|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostosis is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by <b>multiple</b> exostoses (<b>osteochondromas)</b> usually affecting the metaphysical regions of long bones, usually {{of the lower}} extremity, and seldom occurring in the axial skeleton. In the literature, hereditary {{multiple exostosis}} cases that developed spinal canal stenosis due to spinal osteochondromas have been reported. Lumbar spinal stenosis may occur in a hereditary multiple exostosis patient due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, which is a hyperosteotic process that differs from exostosis.

40|$|A male infant {{showed a}} humeral {{diaphysis}} fracture at 5 {{months of age}} and a distal tibial physis fracture at 2 years of age. A specialized consultant ruled out child abuse. This child had the characteristic features of type I osteogenesis imperfecta: blue sclerae, osseous fragility, and presumably autosomal dominant inheritance, as his father suffered from similar disorders. Later on, <b>multiple</b> painful <b>osteochondromas</b> were also found {{and some of these}} were surgically treated. The child's mother showed several peripheral osteochondromas. We describe the follow-up of this patient up to the age of 18 years. To our knowledge, the fortuitous association of these two inherited conditions has not been reported in medical literature...|$|R
50|$|Tests for {{osteochondroma}} {{can also}} identify {{diseases such as}} secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and Multiple osteochondromatosis. In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises {{at the site of}} osteochondroma due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple osteochondromatosis are similar to solitary osteochondroma, but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to osteochondroma, DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in autosomal dominant mode.|$|E
50|$|Osteochondromas {{are long}} and slender, pedunculated on a stalk often taking {{the shape of a}} cauliflower. The {{cartilage}} cap is covered by fibrous perichondrium and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the osteochondroma, which is attached to the perichondrium of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma.Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11. About 70-75% of <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> are caused by point mutations, often involving deletion of single or multiple axons as found in 10% of all hereditary cases. In about 10-15% of all cases no genomic alterations are detected. The mechanism behind the formation of multiple osteochondroma is large genomic deletions of EXT1 and EXT2 genes. The identified mechanism behind solitary osteochondromas is the homozygous deletions of the EXT1 gene. However, the exact cause of osteochondroma is unknown. Additionally, the molecular basis of genetics and clinical variability of multiple osteochondroma as well as the underlying causes for the malignant transformation and the onset of osteochondroma in EXT negative patients is also currently unknown.|$|E
50|$|Research done using Zebrafish dackel (dak) {{have shown}} that in EXT2-/- Zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo {{terminal}} differentiation and bone formation fails to progress from pre-osteoblasts stage to osteoblasts. Instead, abnormal lipid deposition and premature adipocyte differentiation takes place. The expression of xbp1, master regulator of osterix gets reduced, suggesting that unfolded proteins responses {{may play a role}} in pathogenesis of multiple osteochondroma. The research concludes that heparan sulphates are required for terminal differentiation and formation of scaffold that is needed for bone development. At least one copy of EXT2 gene is needed for proper bone development and to maintain the balance between bone and fat cell lineages. Due to homozygous loss of EXT2 function, leads to imbalance between cartilage, bone, and fat cell lineages. These observations in null zebrafish points toward the musculoskeletal defects observed in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Due to the findings of bone-fat imbalance in Zebra fish model, future studies should address status of lipid composition in patients with multiple osteochondroma.Research conducted using sequencing methods has identified a novel frame shift mutation at the glycosyltransferase domain (c.1457insG) located at codon 486 of exon 6 of the EXT1 gene, that causes <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas.</b> This study was conducted in two multiple osteochondroma (MO) patients from the Chinese descent (same family) and the results were validated with four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. The results of the mutations were validated using two different sequencing methods (Exome and Sanger). The results of immunohistochemistry and multiple sequence alignment supports the cause of MO being a mutation in EXT1 gene. However, the exact molecular mechanism of multiple osteochondroma remains unclear. The EXT1 gene encodes the endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes polymerization of heparin sulfate chain at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Heparin sulfate regulates signal transduction during chondrocyte differentiation, ossification, and apoptosis. Malfunction in heparin sulfate synthesis causes chondrocytes to rapidly differentiate. Based on these results future studies should elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the glycosyltransferase domain of the EXT1 and its involvement in the development of multiple osteochondromas.Osteochondromas are associated with secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, but the pathogenesis of the malignant bone tumor remains unknown. Research has demonstrated that chondrocytes with dysfunctional EXT1 is present in solitary osteochondromas, but the EXT1 is functional in sporadic (solitary) secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Research indicates that osteochondromas creates a special niche in which wild type cells are mixed in with EXT functional cells. Then these EXT functional cells undergo other mutations, that give rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating the involvement of an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Future studies should address the contributing gene that causes the formation of peripheral chondrosarcoma. It should also illustrate what causes chondrocytes functional with EXT1 and EXT2 within the osteochondroma to become more susceptible to mutations leading to malignancy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Osteochondroma is {{the most}} common tumor of bone, {{accounting}} for approximately one third of benign lesions in the skeleton is a broad (sessile) or narrow (pedunculated) skeletal protrusion comprised of marrow and cortical bone. Although it is benign, its biological behavior still has a malignant potential. Chondrosarcoma arising in osteochondroma has been recognized for many years. Osteochondromas might occur on any bone preformed in cartilage, they were especially seen on the long bones of the extremities, predominantly around the knee. In fact, the lower limb seemed to be at a higher risk of the tumor than the upper limb on the top two locations: distal part of the femur and proximal part of the tibia, however, the proximal humerus ranked the third place for solitary osteochondroma while the proximal fibula for <b>multiples</b> <b>osteochondromas.</b> Methods and Findings: A total of 20 skeletons and 18 cadavers of both sex, 16 males and 2 females, with different age groups were used, this study was carried out by routine dissection classes for undergraduate medical student´s in the Morphology Laboratory of the University of Pamplona during the years 2013 - 2016. In only one sample was found the presence of osteochondroma. The measurement of the osseous mass was of 7 x 3. 5 x 1. 5 cm, attached to the posterolateral aspect of the middle third of the femur. Conclusions: Osteochondroma is generally asymptomatic or discovered accidentally, but it can cause different symptoms depending on site of occurrence local swelling, bony deformities, fracture, bursa formation, arthritis and impingement on adjacent tendons, vascular or neurologic compromise, and dislocation The importance of correct treatment and follow-up of large osteochondromas to avoid complications such as further damage to neighboring neurovascular structures, and potential malignant degeneration.

40|$|Background: The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} osteochondroma (OC) varies greatly around the world. There {{has been no}} recent report on OC in a large Chinese population. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize OC by an epidemiological analysis of the clinical data from one medical institution in South China. Methods: We searched medical electronic records from January 2001 to January 2016 in one large hospital in South China to identify patients with a definite diagnosis of OC. Their epidemiological data were collected and analyzed statistically, including gender, tumor site, age at first diagnosis and symptoms, local recurrence and malignant transformation. Differences between genders and between solitary <b>osteochondroma</b> (SO) and <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondroma</b> (MO) were particularly analyzed. Results: A total of 431 OC patients (291 males and 140 females; 329 SOs and 102 MOs) were identified. The gender ratio was 2. 08 with a male predominance. OCs were mostly located around the knee (250 cases). 280 patients were in their 0 s to 20 s upon first diagnosis. The average age at the time of first diagnosis was 20. 63 years for all, 18. 47 years for males and 25. 11 years for females (P= 0. 000). OC recurred locally in 35 patients (15 SOs and 20 MOs), with a significant difference between SO/MO (P= 0. 000) but not between genders (P= 0. 100). The average interval from the primary surgery to local or malignant recurrence was 37. 41 months. Malignant transformation was found in 5 patients (4 males and 1 female), showing no gender difference (P= 0. 549). Conclusions: OC may have a male predominance in Chinese population. It mostly occurred at 0 – 20 years of age and around the knee. Upon the first diagnosis of OC, the males tended to be younger than the females, and so did the MO patients than the SO ones. In addition, MO had a higher incidence of local recurrence. Intervals from primary surgery to local recurrence or malignant transformation in MO patients were longer than in SO patients...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that osteochondromas of the {{cervical}} vertebrae can cause myelopathy and neck pain. The reported etiology, diagnosis, treatment and differential diagnosis were reviewed.

The authors describe a unusual clinical manifestation of a solitary osteochondroma located in the right posterior arch of the atlas. Complete removal of the tumor was performed resulting in the relief of neck pain and spastic quadriparesis. Although unusual, osteochondromas of the cervical spine must be considered in patients with persistent neck pain and progressive symptoms of myelopathy.

40|$|Familial {{diseases}} {{leading to}} bone tumor formation are rare.

40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostoses (HME) is {{an inherited}} genetic condition {{characterized by the}} presence of <b>multiple</b> exostoses (<b>osteochondromas).</b> MHE is a relatively rare autosomal dominant disorder, mainly caused by loss of function mutations in two genes: exostosin- 1 (EXT 1) and exostosin- 2 (EXT 2). These genes are linked to heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis, but the specific molecular mechanism leading to the disruption of the cartilage structure and the consequent exostoses formation is still not resolved. The aim {{of this paper is to}} encounter the main aspects of HME reviewing the literature, in order to improve clinical features and evolution, and the metabolic-pathogenetic mechanisms underlying. Although MHE may be asymptomatic, a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations is found in paediatric patients with this disorder. Pain is experienced by the majority of patients, even restricted motion of the joint is often encountered. Sometimes exostoses can interfere with normal development of the growth plate, giving rise to limb deformities, low stature and scoliosis. Other many neurovascular and associated disorders can lead to surgery. The most feared complication is the malignant transformation of an existing osteochondroma into a secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, during adulthood. The therapeutic approach to HME is substantially surgical, whereas the medical one is still at an experimental level. In conclusion, HME is a complex disease where the paediatrician, the geneticist and the orthopaedic surgeon play an interchangeable role in diagnosis, research and therapy. We are waiting for new studies able to explain better the role of HS in signal transduction, because it plays a role in other bone and cartilage diseases (in particular malignant degeneration) as well as in skeletal embryolog...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{autosomal}} dominant condition <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas,</b> formerly called multiple hereditary exostoses, {{is associated with}} a risk of malignant progression of osteochondroma into secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Most patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> have exostosin- 1 or exostosin- 2 gene mutations. To our knowledge, it has not been previously reported that patients may also harbor intraosseous (central) chondroid neoplasms, enchondromas, or atypical chondroid tumors or central chondrosarcomas. The combination of osteochondroma and enchondromas also exists in patients with metachondromatosis, a disorder associated with a protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 gene mutation. This study aims to establish any correlation between <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and intraosseous cartilaginous neoplasms. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all histologically proven intraosseous atypical chondroid tumors or chondrosarcomas in our prospective nationwide Dutch tertiary referral <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> database. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, histological, and genetic data were recorded. The institutionalmedical ethics review board approved the study. Results: From 195 adult patients, seven (3. 6 %) were identified with intraosseous atypical chondroid tumor or chondrosarcoma World Health Organization grade 1 and had a mean age of forty-two years; five of these patients were male. In all cases, radiographic and genetic findings were consistent with <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas,</b> not metachondromatosis; three patients had an exostosin- 1 mutation, four patients had an exostosin- 2 mutation, and no patients had a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 mutation. Six patients underwent successful operative treatment without complications or recurrences after a mean follow-up duration of forty-eight months (range, twelve to 144 months). One patient was scheduled for surgery after biopsy and histologic confirmation. Of the seven patients, five (71 %) also developed a peripheral chondrosarcoma in a known osteochondroma during the study period. Conclusions: Apart from osteochondromas or peripheral chondrosarcomas, <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> are also associated with intraosseous chondroid neoplasms, potentially resulting in central chondrosarcoma. Therefore, intraosseous lesions should not automatically be regarded as innocuous in this patient populatio...|$|E

Particularly, the incidence of osteochondroma in the spine {{is reported to be}} very rare in the literature (Khosla et al. 1999). The spinal involvement of HME is about 7 – 9  % (Giudicissi-Filho et al. 2006), whereas that of solitary osteochondroma is about 1 – 4  % (Chooi et al. 2005). This tumor can occur in any vertebrae of the spine, but the cervical spine is commonly involved in about 50  % (Murphey et al. 2000). The most frequent site is the C 2 vertebral bone, followed by C 3 and C 6 (Chatzidakis et al. 2007; Maheshwari et al. 2006; Schomacher et al. 2009). Osteochondroma typically occurs in young patients, but those of the spine usually occur during the second to third decades of life (Bess et al. 2005; Sakai et al. 2002). Sakai et al. suggested that degenerative changes of the vertebrae might contribute to the initiation of symptoms in the elderly. Some authors reported that both <b>multiple</b> and solitary <b>osteochondromas</b> {{are more likely to be}} appeared in the male than the female (Gille et al. 2005; Labram and Mohan 1996). However, Zaijun et al. (2013) reported that female patients showed symptoms more frequently than male patients in solitary osteochondroma of the spine [9 : 3].|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their cognate receptors (BMPRs) in osteochondromas {{has not been}} investigated. We determined the immunohistochemical localization and distribution of BMP- 2 / 4, - 6 and - 7; BMP receptors BMPR- 1 A, BMPR- 1 B and BMPR- 2; signal transducing proteins phosphorylated Smad 1 / 5 / 8; and BMP antagonist noggin in the cartilaginous cap of solitary (SO) and <b>multiple</b> (MO) human <b>osteochondromas</b> and compared these with bovine growth plate and articular cartilage. The distribution and localization patterns for BMP- 6, BMP- 7, BMPR- 1 A and BMPR- 2 were similar between the cartilaginous cap and the growth plate. BMP- 2 / 4 and BMPR- 1 B were present throughout the growth plate. However, BMP- 2 / 4 and phosphorylated Smad 1 / 5 / 8 were mainly detected in proliferating chondrocytes of the cartilaginous cap. Also, BMPR- 1 B was found in hypertrophic chondrocytes of SO and proliferating chondrocytes of MO. Noggin was observed in resting chondrocytes and, to a lesser extent, in clustered proliferating chondrocytes in SO. On the other hand, noggin in MO was observed in proliferating chondrocytes. Since BMPs can stimulate proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes, {{these findings suggest that}} there is an imbalance of BMP- 2 / 4 and noggin interactions that may lead to abnormal regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the cartilaginous cap of human osteochondromas. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R
30|$|The {{internal}} and external validity of the included studies in the systematic review was low as important criteria were missing on different items. A lack of information on internal validity items, such as the representativeness of the study group, duration of follow-up, blind assessment of the outcome and adjustment for other factors could have led to invalid results.

40|$|Endochondral bone {{formation}} requires a cartilage template, {{known as the}} growth plate, and vascular invasion, bringing osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Endochondral chondrocytes undergo sequences of cell division, matrix secretion, cell hypertrophy, apoptosis, and matrix calcification/mineralisation. In this study, two critical steps of endochondral {{bone formation}}, the deposition of collagen X-rich matrix and blood vessel attraction/invasion, were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and six secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas occurring in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> were studied and compared to epiphyseal growth plate samples. Mutation analysis showed all studied patients (expect one) to harbour a germ-line mutations in either EXT 1 or EXT 2. Here, we described that homozygous mutations in EXT 1 /EXT 2, which are causative for osteochondroma formation, are likely to affect terminal chondrocyte differentiation and vascularisation in the osteocartilaginous interface. Contrastingly, terminal chondrocyte differentiation and vascularisation seem to be unaffected in secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. In addition, osteochondromas with high vascular density displayed a higher proliferation rate. A similar apoptotic rate was observed in osteochondromas and secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that cells with functional EXT 1 and EXT 2 are outnumbering EXT 1 /EXT 2 mutated cells in secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. This might explain the increased type X collagen production and blood vessel attraction in these malignant tumours...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors located peripherally {{in the bone}} may be a challenging task in surgical pathology. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate interobserver reliability in histological diagnosis of cartilaginous tumors in the setting of <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> and to evaluate possible histological parameters that could differentiate among osteochondroma, low- and high-grade secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Interobserver reliability was assessed by 12 specialized bone-tumor pathologists in a set of 38 cases. Substantial agreement on diagnosis among all the reviewers was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 78). Our study confirmed that mitotic figures and nuclear pleomorphism are hallmarks of high-grade secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. However, despite the substantial agreement, we demonstrated that histology alone cannot distinguish osteochondroma from low-grade secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma in the setting of <b>multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas,</b> as nodularity, the presence of binucleated cells, irregular calcification, cystic/mucoid changes and necrosis were not helpful to indicate malignant transformation of an osteochondroma. On the other hand, among the concordant cases, the cartilage cap in osteochondroma was significantly less thicker than in low- and high-grade secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Therefore, our study showed that a multidisciplinary approach integrating clinical and radiographical features and the size of the cartilaginous cap in combination with a histological assessment are crucial to the diagnosis of cartilaginous tumors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>Osteochondromas</b> (MO) is {{a disease}} of benign bony growths with a low {{incidence}} of malignant transformation. Secondary chondrosarcoma in children is rare even in children with MO. Making a diagnosis of malignancy in low-grade cartilage tumors is challenging and requires consideration of clinical, radiographic, and histopathological factors. We report two cases of skeletally immature patients with MO who presented with rapidly enlarging and radiographically aggressive lesions consistent with malignant transformation. Both underwent allograft reconstruction of the involved site with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease at a minimum of four-year follow-up...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Multiple</b> <b>osteochondromas</b> (MO) is an {{autosomal}} dominant skeletal disease {{characterized by the}} formation of multiple cartilage-capped bone tumors growing outward from the metaphyses of long tubular bones. MO is genetically heterogeneous, and is associated with mutations in Exostosin- 1 (EXT 1) or Exostosin- 2 (EXT 2), both tumor-suppressor genes of the EXT gene family. All members of this multigene family encode glycosyltransferases involved in the adhesion and/or polymerization of heparin sulfate (HS) chains at HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs {{have been shown to}} play a role in the diffusion of Ihh, thereby regulatin...|$|E
