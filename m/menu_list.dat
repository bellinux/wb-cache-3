5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a <b>menu</b> <b>list</b> of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
25|$|The NES {{version of}} Portopia Serial Murder Case was {{released}} in 1985 and became a major hit in Japan, where it sold over 700,000 copies. With no keyboard, the NES version, developed by Chunsoft, replaced the verb-noun parser of the original with a command selection <b>menu</b> <b>list,</b> which included fourteen set commands selectable with the gamepad. It also featured a cursor that can be moved on the screen using the D-pad to look for clues and hotspots, like a point-and-click interface. Horii's second adventure game Hokkaido Chain Murders was later also ported to the NES in 1987. Yuji Horii's third mystery adventure game Karuizawa Yūkai Annai (The Karuizawa Kidnapping Guide) was released for the PC-8801 in early 1985 and for the FM-7 in June that same year. It utilized the command menu system and point-and-click cursor interface of both Portopia Serial Murder Case and Hokkaido Chain Murders, in addition to introducing its own innovation: an overhead map. This gave the player direct control over the player character, who can be moved around in a top-down view to explore the area.|$|E

The earliest known title to use the command selection menu system was the Japanese adventure game Spy 007 (スパイ00.7), published in April 1983, and it was followed soon after by several other Japanese adventure games in 1983. These included the eroge title Joshiryo Panic, authored by Tadashi Makimura and published by Enix for the FM-7 in June and slightly earlier for the FM-8; Atami Onsen Adventure (熱海温泉アドベンチャー), released by Basic System (ベーシックシステム) in July for the FM-7 and slightly earlier for the PC-8001; Planet Mephius, released in July; and Tri-Dantal (トリダンタル), authored by Y. Takeshita and published by Pax Softnica for the FM-7 in August.

Some people use butter or ghee for making it more viscous and for making it properly crispy. After some time the Kalari is flipped over and covered again. After sautéing, it gets brownish crispy layer outside and soft, creamy, gooey melted cheese inside (akin to melted mozzarella cheese).|$|E

30|$|The next {{experiment}} {{investigates the}} time the driver spent operating the audio system while driving. A conventional car audio system was used. Some of the common options offered included selecting a music file using folder selection or file selection. The music files were manually categorized prior to the experiment to provide hierarchical menu lists. One choice for the <b>menu</b> <b>list</b> type is designed to categorize the music files by album. The user can choose a specific album or songs to play via the user interface. Another choice of <b>menu</b> <b>list</b> is designed to categorize music files based on the genres, including classical, folk, opera, jazz, pop, blues, rock, R and B. The user can choose music files within a category or outside a category. The user can choose whether to activate the repeat or random options when selecting the category. The third type of <b>menu</b> <b>list</b> combines the features in the previous two. The user can categorize the music files based on the album and then sort the album based on the genres. The user can have a <b>menu</b> <b>list</b> that contains three layers.|$|E
