40|$|The {{softening}} and <b>melting</b> <b>test</b> {{is widely}} {{used to assess the}} behaviour of ferrous materials in the cohesive zone of a blast furnace. It is generally agreed that the performance of lump ores is inferior to sinter in the test. To understand the factors determining material behaviour, tests were terminated by quenching samples at different temperatures. The samples were then studied under an optical microscope. The formation of a low temperature liquid fayalite caused beds of lump ores to rearrange and contract earlier. Beds of fluxed sinter remained essentially intact with reduction until higher temperatures. The study also showed that results obtained for a mixed burden of 80 % sinter and 20 % lump ore – a ratio used in many blast furnaces – are not different to results obtained from tests using only sinter. This difference increases as the lump ore level is increased. These findings indicate that there is significant interaction between the material types in the test and that results from single material tests should not be used in isolation assess material performance in a blast furnace. Any prejudice against lump ores as a blast furnace feed material based on softening and <b>melting</b> <b>test</b> results for single materials is clearly incorrect...|$|E

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} behaviour {{of reducing}} ferrous materials is quantified using a laboratory softening and <b>melting</b> <b>test.</b> Using {{a combination of}} standard, non-standard and quenched tests supported by optical image analysis this work has highlighted some important differences in behaviour between lump, pellets and sinter {{as well as between}} the lump ores and the pellets. One lump ore is denser than the other and there is also a denser pellet. In both cases, the denser ore/pellet is also higher in silica content. Densification of the ferrous bed leads to reduced bed permeability. Studies indicate that densification can happen through two mechanisms. Results show that material density and silica content are two key factors causing increased bed densification. Material density influences reduction efficiency and wustite levels while silica influences the level of fayalite formed. Fayalite is formed by reactions between wustite and silica. Results also show that the behaviour of fluxed sinter is superior to ore and acid pellets because lime preferentially reacts with silica to form dicalcium silicate, a high melting temperature compound. Studies using mixtures of fluxed sinter and lump ore indicate that blast furnace burdens can easily accommodate 20 % ore...|$|E

The flow characteristics of the slag determine size, shape and area of the cohesive zone in the furnace.

This thesis utilizes the TDA software AyasdiTM inorder to improve {{the accuracy of the}} energy model of an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), pinpointingthe causes of a wrong calculation of the steel temperature. Almost 50 % of the charges analyzedpresented an underestimation of temperature, while under 30 % an overestimation. First a dataset was created by filtering the data obtained by the company. After an initialscreening, around 700 charges built the dataset, each one characterized by 104 parameters. Thedataset was subsequently used to create a topological network through the TDA software. Bycomparing the distribution of each parameter with the distribution of the wrong temperatureestimation, it was possible to identify which parameters provided a biased trend. In particular, itwas found that an overestimation of temperature was caused by an underestimation of themelting energy of materials not having through a <b>melting</b> <b>test.</b> It was also found a possible biasedtrend in some distribution of parameters like %O in steel and slag weight, which it is believedare all connected together.

Three <b>tests</b> (stretch <b>test,</b> <b>melt</b> <b>test,</b> and browning test) were modified to evaluate the quality of cheese. A stretch test using the Brookfield helipath viscometer to stretch the cheese sample at 60 °C was successful in distinguishing cheeses from different make procedures and from different proteolytic strains.

Cheese made with Pre strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus stretched less but showed longer melting flow than that from Prt+ strains.

Thermal analysis of canister design concepts examined effects of type of storage, use of fins, emissivity, canister size and cracks in glass.

Initial studies on the effects of alpha and recoil bombardment (from $sup 244 $Cm doping) on devitrification of waste- containing glass were completed. The devitrification behavior of a waste-bearing zinc orthosilicate glass is being studied using optical microscopy, electron microprobe, and x-ray diffraction examination. Fine calcine particles were agglomerated into larger particles suitable for coating via chemical vapor deposition. Thermal stability tests of nickel and Cr$sub 7 $C$sub 3 $ coatings on waste calcine have been conducted, and deterioration has occurred at temperatures as low as 500 $sup 0 $C.

These factors become more important with the welding of high strength steels (HSS) because structures containing welded seams loose the benefit from {{the strength of the}} steel. The weld seam fatigue strength can be improved locally with several different methods. In this paper residual stresses of the weld area and their modifications for improving the fatigue strength are discussed. The residual stresses of the toe area are changed from tensile up to compressive stresses, which are known to improve fatigue strength, with several methods.

Test glasses were fabricated in the laboratory to verify {{the applicability of the}} product performance models to glasses produced with these frits. Characterization of the glasses fabricated with the selected frits showed that all of the glasses had durability responses that are considered very acceptable at a waste loading of 36 %. The durability responses were predictable by the free energy of hydration models. No crystallization was identified in the quenched glasses. Samples of the glasses that were slowly cooled following the canister centerline cooled (ccc) thermal profile were found to contain small amounts of magnetite. This crystalline phase had little impact on the durability of the glasses, and therefore is not an issue for concern based on the February 2007 projections.

Synthetic compound was white smooth crystal powder, and had a specific flavour with yield was 4. 68 % and melting point was 132 - 133 OC. Solubility test showed the  synthetic compound dissolved in ethanol, methanol, chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, hot water, and acetone; very difficult soluble in water. Gas chromatography chromatogram showed one peak with retention time 13. 321 minute. Based on structure elucidation conclude that synthetic compound was cinnamic acid...|$|R
