50|$|Generally speaking, the {{approaches}} adopted in E-commerce authentication are {{basically the same}} as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field {{that focuses on the}} transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a <b>merchant</b> <b>server</b> via the Internet. The <b>merchant</b> <b>server</b> usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.|$|E

50|$|Neither rely on {{the storage}} of credit card or {{password}} details, with no details stored on a server that can be hacked.

40|$|Abstract: Non-repudiation of {{a mobile}} payment {{transaction}} ensures {{that when a}} buyer (B) sends some messages to a seller (S), neither B nor S can deny having partic-ipated in this transaction. An evidence of a transaction is generated by wireless PKI (WPKI) mechanism such that B and S cannot repudiate sending and receiving the purchase order respectively. Broker generates a mobile agent for B which carries en-crypted purchase order to S. A trusted third party (TTP) acts as a lightweight notary for evidence generations. One advantage of this agent-based non-repudiation proto-col is to reduce inconvenience for mobile clients such as connection time and search for suitable <b>merchant</b> <b>servers,</b> etc.; it provides necessary security mechanisms for fair mobile payment transactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an extension {{to the current}} Java security model called the &quot;Gateway &quot; and why {{it was necessary to}} create it. This model allows secure applications, such as those used in electronic commerce, to safely exchange data and interoperate without compromising each individual application's security. The Gateway uses digital signatures to enable application programming interfaces to authenticate their caller. JavaSoft is using the Gateway to create a new integrated open platform for financial applications called Java Electronic Commerce Framework. The JECF will be the foundation for electronic wallets, point of sale terminals, electronic <b>merchant</b> <b>servers</b> and other financial software. The Gateway model can also be used for access control in many multiple application environments that require trusted interaction between applications from multiple vendors. These applications include browsers, servers, operating systems, medical systems and smartcards. 1. Electronic Commerce in Java Sun Microsystems Inc.

5000|$|Microsoft {{chose the}} name [...] "Merchant Server" [...] because, at that time, Netscape was {{shipping}} a product named Commerce Server. To avoid trademark issues, Microsoft needed a different name.

50|$|In 1997, the {{software}} was re-branded to Microsoft <b>Merchant</b> <b>Server,</b> then Microsoft Site Server, eventually being renamed to Microsoft Commerce Server in 2000. Initially released in 2000, Commerce Server replaced Microsoft Site Server, expanding on the functionality {{and establishing a}} focus on e-commerce functionality (rather than concerning itself with document management or content metadata). It helped to create an e-commerce solution or web site with high-performance, familiar tools designed to simplify setup, management, and administration tasks.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Site Server, first {{released}} in 1996, was Microsoft's {{solution to the}} growing difficulty of managing complex websites which included multiple technologies, such as user management and authentication/authorization, content management, analysis, and indexing and search. Site Server 2.0, {{released in}} early 1997, incorporated electronic commerce technology from Microsoft <b>Merchant</b> <b>Server,</b> Microsoft's first effort at providing {{a solution to the}} growing business of Internet-based commerce (or e-commerce). During the course of its evolution (culminating with Site Server 3.0), Site Server expanded on Merchant Server's functionality by annexing content management tools; which would typically be involved, it was thought, in facilitating the management of Web-facing content. Consequently, Site Server became not only a solution for businesses wanting to sell products online, but companies who had corporate intranet servers hosting documents.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} a secure {{intelligent}} trade agent. In building this agent, we adapt our agent to use with a secure and efficient electronic cash (executable digital-cash, x-cash) [1] to enable agents to carry funds and make payments on-site without running the risk of “pick-pocketing”. It is a means of binding an offer to accompanying goods or payment, enabling the processes of searching and paying to be unified. The result is a mechanism by which electronic trades can occur in a highly distributed setting with strong security guarantees. This model provides an interface by which users obtain the certificates from the bank and authorizing them to make payments. The user can login to the agent repository (AR) for issuing offer programs ω. The program ω along with the certificate constitutes a piece of x-cash. An agent together with the executable digital cash (x-cash) which represents a buyer will be sent across the Internet via “asymmetric proxy reencryption protocol [2, 9], executing methods (ω) on a number of <b>merchant’s</b> <b>server</b> (on remote server systems).

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{commerce}} {{is continuing}} as a thriving business for those companies that streamlined their online business processes; however, making payments over the Internet is still fearsome to customers. Although {{a variety of}} payment mechanisms have been developed, payment by credit cards remain the leading mechanism for online payments. For real-time online credit card processing, a merchant needs to install a third-party proprietary software in the <b>merchant</b> e-commerce <b>server.</b> However, many issues need to be resolved before integrating a third-party payment solution to a merchant e-commerce system. In this paper, we attempt to address {{the current state of}} the online credit card processing system, especially we discuss the available models of online real-time credit card processing systems. We also discuss several factors such as cost, complexity and security issues related to implementing such a system. The results can be extremely valuable to small businesses that are venturing into Internet commerce...|$|R
50|$|Given {{the lack}} of ability to inspect {{merchandise}} before purchase, consumers are at higher risk of fraud than face-to-face transactions. When ordering merchandise online, the item may not work properly, it may have defects, or {{it might not be}} the same item pictured in the online photo. Merchants also risk fraudulent purchases if customers are using stolen credit cards or fraudulent repudiation of the online purchase. However, merchants face less risk from physical theft by using a warehouse instead of a retail storefront. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption has generally solved the problem of credit card numbers being intercepted in transit between the consumer and the merchant. However, one must still trust the merchant (and employees) not to use the credit card information subsequently for their own purchases, and not to pass the information to others. Also, hackers might break into a merchant's web site and steal names, addresses and credit card numbers, although the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is intended to minimize the impact of such breaches. Identity theft is still a concern for consumers. A number of high-profile break-ins in the 2000s has prompted some U.S. states to require disclosure to consumers when this happens. Computer security has thus become a major concern for merchants and e-commerce service providers, who deploy countermeasures such as firewalls and anti-virus software to protect their networks. Phishing is another danger, where consumers are fooled into thinking they are dealing with a reputable retailer, when they have actually been manipulated into feeding private information to a system operated by a malicious party. Denial of service attacks are a minor risk for <b>merchants,</b> as are <b>server</b> and network outages.|$|R

The system tailors the product selection and description to her interests and domain expertise. Since this task requires the parallel execution of complex activities during the interactions with users, the virtual store is organized as a multiagent architecture. 1 Introduction In the electronic sales, many tools have been built to set up stores (e. g. Oracle's Internet Commerce Server, Microsoft <b>Merchant</b> <b>Server,</b> Netscape Merchant [8]); these tools offer a virtual store skeleton and allow store builders to introduce {{the description of the}} goods to be sold. While these systems have mostly been focused on the management of order processing and secure payment transactions, only recently the personalization of the interactions with customers has received special attention. Since virtual stores are accessed by heterogeneous users, the interactions should be individualized in the selection [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of wireless devices, offering connectivity and convenience, continues to exert marvelous demands on merchants to deploy secure wireless applications including electronic commerce. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the protocol above TCP, which can protect user’s privacy when they sending {{data from a}} client side to a web server, {{this is an important}} protocol due to the expansion of Internet. In fact, it is a long way to make the SSL/TLS protocol perfectly. Although the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol offers end-to-end security for credit card transactions over a wired infrastructure, there are several factors including bandwidth requirements which make it unsuitable for wireless applications. In this paper we review a secure electronic payment system for Internet transaction. The electronic payment system is to be secure for Internet transaction participants such as Payment gateway server, Bank sever and <b>Merchant</b> <b>server.</b> The security architecture of the system is designed by using Many Security Protocols and techniques, which eliminates the fraud that occurs today with stolen credit card/debit card payment information and customer information.
