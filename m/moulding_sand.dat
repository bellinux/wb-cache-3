40|$|The {{harmfulness}} {{assessment of}} <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with a geopolymer binder {{and a new}} hardener, in {{an aspect of the}} emission of substances from the BTEX group, was performed. Within the expedience project the new series of hardeners for the inorganic GEOPOL binder was developed. Before the introduction of the new system of <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> it was necessary to estimate their influence on the environment. To this aim the gasses emission from <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> subjected to the influence of liquid cast iron was tested with regard to the content of the gases from the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes). For the comparison the analogous investigations of the up to now applied <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with the geopolymer binder, were performed. It was found that both systems of <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> binding emit similar amounts of gases, as well as similar amounts of substances from the BTEX group. <b>Moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with the GEOPOL binder are much more environmentally friendly than <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with organic binders. The content of the BTEX group substances in gases emitted from <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with the GEOPOL binder was approximately 10 -times lower than in case of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> with organic binders...|$|R

50|$|The first load of coal {{arrived in}} Mansfield on 13 April 1819 {{and was taken}} to the {{marketplace}} to be ceremoniously burnt. Costing less than £25,000 to build, its original purpose had been to carry stone and lime from Mansfield, but it soon proved its worth carrying coal. It facilitated the opening of a number of new pits, for which branches were provided, along with a branch to the Butterley Company's works at Codnor Park. Another important cargo was <b>moulding</b> <b>sand</b> from Mansfield. Although, in the long term the railway would bring prosperity to Mansfield, it initially caused a great deal of distress to the horse dealers and wagon masters, many of whom lost their livelihood.

The main purpose of investigations was to determine the influence of reclaim fractions and the applied hardener on the basic <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> properties, such as: bending and tensile strength, permeability and grindability. The unfavourable influence of the reclaim additions into <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> on the tested properties as well as an increased hardening rate, were found. <b>Moulding</b> <b>sands,</b> in which the hardener KR 72 of the KRATOS Company was used, were less sensitive to the reclaim addition...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} examination {{results of}} the effect of four hardening methods on structure of linking bridges in sandmixes containing hydrated sodium silicate. Test pieces prepared of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> containing 2. 5 % of a binder with molar module between 2. 4 and 2. 6 were hardened with carbon dioxide, dried traditionally in an oven and hardened with microwaves at 2. 54 GHz or using a combination of the CO 2 process and microwave heating. It was revealed that the hardening method influences structure of linking bridges and is correlated with mechanical properties of the hardened <b>moulding</b> <b>sands.</b> It was found that strength of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> microwave-heated for 240 s is approximate to that measured after traditional drying for 120 min at 110 °C. So, the microwave hardening permits significant reduction of the process time, comparable to the CO 2 hardening, at the same time guaranteeing over 10 times higher mechanical properties. Analysis of SEM photographs of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> hardened with the mentioned methods allow explaining differences in qualitative parameters of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sands</b> and their relation to structures of the created linking bridges...|$|R

Ground water resources are also extensively tapped in remote areas which are not easily accessible to canals and rivers. It has also been found that about 40% of area in Belagavi district has a higher concentration of nitrates in drinking water due to extensive dependency on fertilisers for agriculture. According to a geological survey, ground water in Gokak has a pH of about 8.6 with desirable limits being 6.5 to 8.5. The region around Gokak contains large quantities of Gneisses rock which ultimately gives rise to clay deposits. Region lying to the north of Gokak consist of Sandstones and Quartzite that form low ridges. The Manganese deposits occur in Belagavi district between Londa and Gokak taluka.

5000|$|Allward was {{assisted}} by his studio assistant, Emanuel Otto Hahn, another highly notable sculptor {{who worked on}} the monument with him until 1912 when Hahn left for the Ontario College of Art. The project proceeded slowly in part due to Allward's concurrent work on several other commissions at the same time, including the South African War Memorial, a major monument erected in Toronto. In April 1915 Allward reported to the committee that the two heroic figures to be mounted on pedestals had been successfully cast and that foundation work for the site had been tendered. But in regards to the central bronze casting, which was to become the largest ever created in North America up to that point, he could not estimate when it would be complete, writing in a letter [...] "I am giving all my time to it; I cannot do more.
