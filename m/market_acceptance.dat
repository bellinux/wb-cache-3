5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the <b>market</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E

BKH observed the sales trends and <b>market</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the products for several months after the introduction for the possible purpose of extending the concept in other markets. While the concept was tailored for the New Zealand market, TPF executives stated {{that it would be}} easy to adapt the concept to other regions. Some restaurant industry observers agreed with the TPF assessment of the products and separately stated other sauces and ingredients could be used to crate variations in the US and other markets. Eventually, the sandwiches were discontinued, with the Sweet Ride and Mango Jammin burgers the first to be removed from the menu.|$|E

It replicated a previous study conducted in China (Gao, Sultan and Rohm, 2010). The original research found that risk acceptance and personal attachment influence mobile <b>marketing</b> <b>acceptance</b> among youth consumers in China.

The present study adopted instruments used in the mobile marketing research conducted in China. Data collection was done by using both offline and online survey. Data analysis was conducted by multiple and simple linear regression analyses. It is found that risk acceptance and personal attachment influence mobile <b>marketing</b> <b>acceptance</b> among youth consumers in Indonesia.

25|$|Artist {{development}} {{was a major}} part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad <b>market</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and that they should think, act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era. Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label. The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist development classes.|$|E

This was proven during the 2006 - 20010 fiscal year; the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>market’s</b> tax was increased. However, in 2006 the tax reception did not reach the target, which was equal to - 6. 39 %.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the effectiveness of <b>market’s</b> <b>acceptance</b> tax, to analyze the performance of the markets’ acceptance tax, to analyze the potential of the market’s tax and to formulate some appropriate strategies to improve the performance of the <b>market’s</b> <b>acceptance</b> tax in Sleman. The data used in this study were secondary data and primary data. The sampling method used in this study was purposive sampling which includes sellers, officers, market’s tax collector, and employee of Sleman Market Service, with total 51 respondents. Based on the calculation of the effectiveness level in 2006 - 2010, the writer found that the average of the <b>market’s</b> tax <b>acceptance</b> in Sleman was not effective, that was equal to 29, 45 %.

The null hypotheses of these homogeneity tests are necessary conditions (or maintained assumptions) for poolability of the data. Thus rejections of these null imply that the data cannot be pooled across <b>markets.</b> <b>Acceptances</b> of these null are considered as supporting evidences for the maintained assumptions of estimation using pooled data.

40|$|Puccinia boroniae, an obligate biotrophic rust pathogen, is the causative {{agent of}} Boronia rust. Many commercially grown species and cultivars of Boronia are susceptible, {{impacting}} on the export <b>market's</b> <b>acceptance</b> of harvested stems. Infection occurs usually during autumn and late spring, {{indicated by the}} development of distinct cinnamon to dark brown pustules (telial stage) on the leaves, stems and/or developing flower buds. Defoliation of the plant canopy may occur in severe infections. Despite intensive studies, only the telial stage (comprised of teliospores and mesospores) has been described to date. Current disease management protocols are only marginally adequate at controlling infection, due in part to our limited knowledge regarding the pathogen's biology, host specificity and pathogenicity. In order to sustain the current industry and allow for future expansion, improved disease management is vital, and involves developing a greater understanding of the pathogen. Preliminary studies into the biology of the telial stage are being undertaken. The objective of these studies is to examine the effect of temperature, light regimes, spore wetness and humidity on the germination of teliospores, and subsequent production and germination of basidiospores (if produced). Techniques and results from this research will be highlighted. The effect of the results on future studies into examining the host specificity and host/pathogen interaction will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{terrestrial}} {{laser scanning}} {{technology in the}} areas of topographic data capture, represent new and exciting opportunities for the mining industry, in particular open cut coal. Terrestrial scanning offers an alternative to traditional survey techniques. It consists of automated high speed data capture of complex surfaces in often inaccessible environments. The use of a TLS system has been examined in this dissertation with respect to its cost effectiveness, user friendliness, and ability to comply with relevant government legislation regulating its use in the open cut coal surveys. The ability to be able to set up the TLS system in a safe location for both operator and machine and acquire all the data of a traditional survey and much more without putting the operator in the line of fire, suggests that TLS systems in dangerous working environments such as mining, will become common place in the near future. This dissertation has been developed from the start of 2008 when the evaluation for purchase of a TLS system was undertaken, and as such prices listed for equipment are indicative for that time. Since then, the prices of TLS systems have dropped dramaticallly, which is a direct reflection of the <b>markets</b> <b>acceptance</b> of TLS technology and surveyor confidence in the stated accuracies of the machines...|$|R
