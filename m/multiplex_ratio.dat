The existence of genetic diversity in turmeric is documented in other countries but not in the Philippines, where turmeric is an introduced species. This study aims to determine the possible existence of genotypic diversity among turmeric accessions in Mindanao, Philippines using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Ten random primers were used for RAPD analysis from which a total of 209 amplification products were generated. Almost all the bands generated were polymorphic indicating genetic diversity among the accessions. Six primers (OPD 08, OPB 07, OPA 11, OPA 12, OPC 05 and OPN 16) had polymorphic information content values of almost 0. 5, thus, were able to discriminate between the turmeric genotypes.

Eleven {{of the most promising}} Sarilop clones and one clone of Sarizeybek, all selected from a former agronomic evaluation, were analysed by three molecular marker techniques, isozymes, RAPDs and AFLPs. The resolution power and the accuracy of these three analytical techniques, in distinguishing among fig clones, were determined. The analysis of five isozyme systems permitted the discrimination between the two cultivars, Sarilop and Sarizeybek. Besides the discrimination between the two fig cultivars, the use of 31 10 -mer primers in RAPD analysis allowed splitting the 11 Sarilop clones into two groups of genetic similarity, but not to distinguish between all the clones.

These instruments typically employ <b>multiplexing</b> <b>ratios</b> well below a hundred. To achieve <b>multiplexing</b> <b>ratios</b> greater than a thousand, {{it is imperative}} to investigate technologies that intrinsically incorporate strong multiplexing. One possible solution is the kinetic inductance detector (KID). To assess the potential of this nascent technology, a prototype instrument optimized for the 2 mm atmospheric window was constructed. Known as the Néel IRAM KID Array (NIKA), it has recently been tested at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy (IRAM) 30 -m telescope at Pico Veleta, Spain. Aims. There were four principle research objectives: to determine the practicality of developing a giant array instrument based on KIDs, to measure current in-situ pixel sensitivities, to identify limiting noise sources, and to image both calibration and scientifically-relevant astronomical sources. Methods. The detectors consisted of arrays of high-quality superconducting resonators electromagnetically coupled to a transmission line and operated at 100 mK. The impedance of the resonators was modulated by incident radiation; two separate arrays were tested to evaluate the efficiency of two unique optical-coupling strategies. The first array consisted of lumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs), which have a fully planar design properly shaped to enable direct absorbtion. The second array consisted of antenna-coupled KIDs with individual sapphire microlenses aligned with planar slot antennas. Both detectors utilized a single transmission line along with suitable room-temperature digital electronics for continuous readout. Results. NIKA was successfully tested in October 2009, performing in line with expectations. The measurement resulted in the imaging of a number of sources, including planets, quasars, and galaxies.

We {{developed}} and characterized expressed sequence tags (ESTs) -simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and targeted region amplified polymorphism (TRAP) markers to examine genetic {{relationships in the}} persimmon genus Diospyros gene pool. In total, we characterized 14 EST-SSR primer pairs and 36 TRAP primer combinations, which were amplified across 20 germplasms of 4 species in the genus Diospyros. We used various genetics parameters, including effective <b>multiplex</b> <b>ratio</b> (EMR), diversity index (DI) and marker index (MI), to test the utility of these markers. TRAP markers gave higher EMR (24. 85) but lower DI (0. 33), compared to EST-SSRs (EMR = 3. 65, DI = 0. 34).

40|$|Emulating large complex designs require multi-FPGA systems (MFS). However, inter-FPGA {{communication}} is {{confronted by the}} challenge of lack of interconnect capacity due to limited number of FPGA input/output (I/O) pins. Serializing parallel signals onto a single trace effectively addresses the limited I/O pin obstacle. Besides the multiplexing scheme and <b>multiplexing</b> <b>ratio</b> (number of inter-FPGA signals per trace), {{the choice of the}} MFS routing architecture also affect the critical path latency. The routing architecture of an MFS is the interconnection pattern of FPGAs, fixed wires and/or programmable interconnect chips. Performance of existing MFS routing architectures is also limited by off-chip interface selection. In this dissertation we proposed novel 2 D and 3 D latency-optimized time-multiplexed MFS routing architectures. We used rigorous experimental approach and real sequential benchmark circuits to evaluate and compare the proposed and existing MFS routing architectures. This research provides a new insight into the encouraging effects of using off-chip optical interface and three dimensional MFS routing architectures. The vertical stacking results in shorter off-chip links improving the overall system frequency with the additional advantage of smaller footprint area. The proposed 3 D architectures employed serialized interconnect between intra-plane and inter-plane FPGAs to address the pin limitation problem. Additionally, all off-chip links are replaced by optical fibers that exhibited latency improvement and resulted in faster MFS. Results indicated that exploiting third dimension provided latency and area improvements as compared to 2 D MFS. We also proposed latency-optimized planar 2 D MFS architectures in which electrical interconnections are replaced by optical interface in same spatial distribution. Performance evaluation and comparison showed that the proposed architectures have reduced critical path delay and system frequency improvement as compared to conventional MFS.

A first order delay analysis between the two schemes shows comparable performance, but a better area efficiency for the TSV.

Molecular marker assisted breeding has the potential to dramatically enhance the pace and efficiency of genetic improvement in Musa. This study was conducted to compare different PCR-based marker systems (RAPD, VNTR and AFLP) for the analysis of breeding populations generated from two diverse Musa breeding schemes.

Heterozygosity arithmetic mean value (Hav(p)), the effective <b>multiplex</b> <b>ratio</b> (EMR) and the marker index (MI), were calculated for isozyme, RAPD and AFLP markers. The mean value of genetic similarity among the different varieties was 0. 92 for isozyme, 0. 73 for RAPD and 0. 58 for AFLP analyses. Thus, AFLP were able to detect polymorphisms with higher efficiency than RAPD (+ 15 %) and isozyme (+ 34 %). Data from the isozyme, RAPD and AFLP analyses were used to compute matrices of genetic similarities. The efficiency of the UPGMA for the estimation of genetic relatedness among varieties was supported by cophenetic correlation coefficients.

We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray rejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at an observation centre frequency of 850 GHz and 20 % fractional bandwidth. Results. The overall system has an excellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per pixel of 50 fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to 300 mHz.

At a loading power per pixel of 50 fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to 300 mHz. The dynamic range would allow the detection of 1 Jy bright sources {{within the field of}} view without tuning the readout of the detectors. The expected dead time due to cosmic ray interactions, when operated in an L 2 or a similar far-Earth orbit, is found to be < 4 %. Additionally, the achieved pixel yield is 83 % and the crosstalk between the pixels is <- 30 dB. This demonstrates that MKID technology can provide <b>multiplexing</b> <b>ratios</b> on the order of a 1000 with state-of-the-art single pixel performance, and that the technology is now mature enough to be considered for future space based observatories and experiments.

40|$|Abstract—Based on {{superposition}} {{of signals}} {{in the time}} domain, we propose a new low-complexity scheme for {{the reduction of the}} peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency di-vision multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed scheme first generates signal candidates by combining an OFDM signal and its cyclically delayed versions with different delays and phases, and then selects the candidate signal with minimum PAPR. It is shown that the complexity of the proposed scheme is significantly lower than that of the selective mapping (SLM) at the cost of some degra-dation in the bit error rate (BER) performance and, at similar PAPR and coded BER performance, is lower than that of the low-complexity SLM proposed recently.

30|$|Each band obtained, {{regardless}} of primer, {{was treated as}} an independent locus. Bands were scored only if they were prominently stained and reproduced each time PCR was carried out. Each individual plant was scored for {{the presence or absence}} of a particular amplified band. Presence was marked as 1 (one) and absence as 0 (zero). The genetic diversity within and among the populations was estimated in terms of HT (total heterozygosity), h (Nei’s genetic diversity; Nei 1973), HS (heterozygosity within population), DST (heterozygosity among populations; Nei 1973), GST (genetic differentiation) and Nm (number of migrants per generation or gene flow; Slatkin and Barton 1989), using POPGENE ver. 1.31 (Yeh et al. 1997). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out to partition the variance among geographic regions, among different populations and among individuals within the populations using GenAlEx 6.4. (Peakall and Smouse 2012). The Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) was calculated using the formula 1 [*]−[*]p 2 [*]−[*]q 2, where q is the frequency of no bands and p is the frequency of present bands (Rajwade et al. 2010; Bhagwat et al. 2014). The primer index (SPI) was then calculated using loci amplified by the same primer with summing up the PIC values (Bhagwat et al. 2014). The Marker Index (MI) for each primer was calculated as a product of PIC and effective <b>multiplex</b> <b>ratio</b> (EMR) (Zhang et al. 2018); MI[*]=[*]EMR[*]×[*]PIC (Pecina-Quintero et al. 2011). The genetic distance data obtained from the analysis of molecular variance was used to perform principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (Peakall and Smouse 2012; Abraham et al. 2018), which showed the percentage variation explained by the first three axes and provided graphical representation of the genetic relationships among populations. The PCoA was executed with the pairwise genetic distance matrix in GenAlEx 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2006; Peakall and Smouse 2012).|$|E
40|$|Iris {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cut flowers in Iran and in the world. Iranian Iris is from the Iridaceae family. The aim of this research was to study the genetic diversity of 18 Iris species collected from different parts of Iran and to identify them according to morphological and molecular characteristics and breeding potential. In this study, 15 quantitative traits, 30 qualitative traits and 10 arbitrarily primed (RAPD) markers were applied to identify genetic differences among species. Principle component and cluster analyses were used as multivariate procedures to classify different species based on molecular and morphological data. Genetic parameters involved in polymorphism information content (PIC), marker index (MI), effective <b>multiplex</b> <b>ratio</b> (EMR) and resolving power (RP) were used to quantify genetic diversity. A very high positive correlation was estimated between inner tepal lengths with inner tepal widths and the lowest negative correlation was found between length of perianth tube and flower size. Cluster analysis based on quantitative traits classified all species into two main groups. The first group consisted of tall Irises and the second of dwarf Irises either with rhizomes or bulbs. Cluster analysis based on qualitative traits classified all species in to two main groups mostly according to flower color, bud color and scent. High genetic diversity was evident among species using RAPD markers. In total, 255 RAPD polymorphic bands were detected for 10 random primes. Numbers of polymorphic bands ranged from 19 for primer RAPD 3 to 31 for primer RAPD 2. PIC varied between 0. 152 and 0. 193. Cluster analysis based on molecular data revealed six different clusters. I. Spuria and hybrid irises (I. germanica and I. imbricata) were separated from other species and placed in different clusters. The highest similarity coefficient (0. 307) was estimated between I. meda and I. iberica species and the lowest (0. 025) was estimated between I. aucheri and I. pseudacaucasica. According to molecular and morphological data I. spuria was segregated from the others. No clear relationship was found for genetic diversity between species in relation to geographical distribution, using either morphological or molecular information...|$|E
40|$|Since {{last few}} decades there is a {{resurgence}} of interest in naturally coloured cotton. This has motivated the cotton breeders to develop eco-friendly naturally coloured cotton varieties. To support such endeavours a study was carried out to characterize some coloured and white cotton genotypes using morphological and molecular markers, study the transcript level of different flavonoids structural genes in brown green and white cotton fibres, find out differences in the fibre structure and obtain information on the inheritance of fibre colour, yield, and quality traits. The scatter plot analysis grouped 20 cotton genotypes into four clusters. White cotton genotypes, except Cute- 98 grouped in Cluster I. The Clusters II and III had all the tetraploid coloured cotton genotypes while Cluster IV had two diploid cotton genotypes. Biplot analysis also showed negative association between fibre colour and fibre quality traits. Both SSR and EST-SSR markers revealed high level of genetic similarity among the cotton genotypes. Two separate dendrograms based on SSR and EST-SSR markers identified four main clusters for 20 cotton genotypes. Nineteen SSR and five EST-SSR markers {{were found to be}} associated with different fibre quality traits. Higher value of expected heterozygosity, effective <b>multiplex</b> <b>ratio</b> and marker index for SSR markers as compared to EST-SSR markers showed distinctive nature of SSR markers in revealing the difference among cotton genotypes. Transcriptome analysis of five flavonoid structural genes i. e., GhCHI, GhF 3 H, GhDFR, GhANS and GhANR revealed temporal expression of these genes during different fibre developmental stages in brown, green and white cotton fibres. The transcript level of all genes was significantly higher in brown then green and white cotton fibres. Scanning electron microscopic analysis at 500 X magnification revealed significant improvement in morphological features of fibre of all coloured hybrids as compared to their parents. The surface structure of brown cotton fibres had rough appearance under SEM (4000 X) than the other parental lines and coloured cotton hybrids. The additive, dominance and epistatic genetic effects appeared {{to be involved in the}} inheritance of various plant traits. Additive type of gene action was involved in the inheritance of boll weight, seed volume and fibre fineness in all crosses. Moderate estimates of narrow sense heritability for these traits confirmed the preponderance of additive gene effects in the inheritance of these traits. Chi-square analysis revealed that single incomplete dominant gene was responsible for the inheritance of fibre colour in naturally coloured cotton. In conclusion, the information on the extent of genetic diversity in cotton germplasm and association of molecular markers with fibre quality traits would be helpful in constructing the breeding populations with desired allelic combinations. The transcriptome analysis of flavonoids structural genes demonstrated that gene manipulation strategy to modulate the transcript level of these genes could improve the pigmentation of brown cotton fibres. Scanning electron microscopy of fibre structure appeared effective in identifying structural difference of fibres in coloured cotton. The comprehensive information on the genetic diversity, fibre structure and gene expression together with the estimates of phenotypic components of genetic variation, obtained from six breeding generation, provided convincing basis for the genetic improvement of coloured cotton cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Direct {{conversion}} orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) systems suffer from transmit and receive analog processing impairments such as in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) among sub-carriers. Another source of performance-limiting ICI in OFDM systems is Doppler spread due to mobility. However, {{the nature of}} ICI due {{to each of them}} is quite different. Unlike previous work which considered these two impairments separately, we develop a unified mathematical framework to characterize, estimate, and jointly mitigate ICI due to I/Q imbalance and high mobility. Based on our general model, we derive a closed-form expression for the degradation in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) due to the impairments. Moreover, we exploit the special ICI structure to design efficient OFDM channel estimation and digital baseband compensation schemes for joint transmit/receive frequency-independent (FI) and frequency-dependent (FD) I/Q imbalances under highmobility conditions.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} reduce the peak-to-mean-envelope-power ratio (PMEPR) of {{multicarrier}} signals by modifying the constellation. For-ary phase-shift keying constellations, we minimize the maximum of the multicarrier signal over the sign and amplitude of each subcarrier. In order to find an efficient solution to the aforementioned nonconvex optimization problem, we present a suboptimal solution by first optimizing over the signs, and then optimizing over the amplitudes given the signs. We prove that the minimization of the maximum of a continuous multicarrier signal over the amplitude of each subcarrier can be written as a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints. We also generalize the idea to other constellations such as 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation. Simulation results show that by an average power increase of 0. 21 dB, and not sending information over the sign of each subcarrier, PMEPR can be decreased by 5. 1 dB for a system with 128 subcarriers.
