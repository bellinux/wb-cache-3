50|$|In {{the most}} common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing,</b> tobacco {{is added to the}} bowl of the pipe in several batches, each one pressed down until the mixture has a uniform density that optimizes airflow (something that it is {{difficult}} to gauge without practice). This can be done with a finger or thumb, but if the tobacco needs to be repacked later, while it is burning, the tamper on a pipe tool is sometimes used. If it needs to be loosened, the reamer, or any similar long pin can be used. A traditional way of packing the pipe is to fill the bowl and then pack gently to about ⅓ full, fill again and pack slightly more firmly to about ⅔ full, and then pack more firmly still to the top.|$|E
40|$|The {{statement}} on page 9 {{of this paper}} that Pack's method is semiempirical is incorrect. Consequently, the paragraph on page 9, lines 19 to 32 should {{be replaced by the}} following: Two <b>of</b> the <b>methods</b> which have had some success in pre-dicting the wavelength were used to calculate the upper and lower curves shown in figure 7 (a) for Mj = 1. O 0. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pack</b> (ref. 15) has been advanced as being applicable to all Mach numbers. It is based upon linear theory (and there-fore subject to the restrictions of linear theory) and is a correction of Prandtl's formula which is known to be in error. (See refs. 6 and 13, for example.) The older <b>method</b> <b>of</b> Hartmann and Lazarus (ref. 14) is proposed for sonic Jets only. This latter method is semiempirical, as are most of the others except those <b>of</b> Prandtl and <b>Pack</b> mentioned above, and it involves constants determined from experimental results for low values of pj/p_. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that both methods are not satisfactory except at very low Jet pressure ratios as indicated in figure 7 (a). Because of the inadequacy at Mj = l, no comparison has been made between the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pack</b> and the present results for higher Mach numbers; further, the assumption <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> that w/dj is independent of Mj and a function only of the ratio of Jet stagnation pressure to the ambient pressure can be shown from these results to be insufficient.

Pressure on resources has seen the use of packaged food and beverages increase in hospitals within the New South Wales region of Australia. Studies at the University of Wollongong have explored the interaction between older people and the types of packages regularly encountered in the delivery of hospital food and nutrition. As these types <b>of</b> <b>packs</b> are commonly found in UK hospitals as well, a series of studies have been undertaken by the University of Wollongong, Australia, and Sheffield Hallam University, UK, to further evaluate the issues surrounding the ‘openability’ of hospital food and beverage packaging in an attempt to understand in detail the issues leading to difficulty in use. Current <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> ‘ease <b>of</b> opening’ evaluation rely on hand strength as the core parameter.

The research part of personal experiment <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> my own apartment. Activities timeline is introduced to estimate the usage of one day and the studies is focused on how much volume we can save by packing the unused space. The result we have is 80 % volume saved by fully pack the space, and 61 % for picking space according to activities time-line in one day. Applying the same <b>method</b> <b>of</b> calculation from the research chapter, we got the average volume use of one dwelling floor in the block over one day is 18. 9 %. Taking the advantage of “PACK and PICK”, is that means we can put 3 times more people in the floor because of “PACK and PICK”? As result, there are conflicts between neigbourhood once the density glowed, in term of volume, privacy, view & light, the limited condition on the floor.

This provides an alternative to the Smart-Vercauteren (SV) ciphertextpacking technique that relies on polynomial-CRT. While the SV technique is only applicable to schemes that rely on ring-LWE (or other hardness assumptions in ideal lattices), the PVW method can be used also for cryptosystems whose security is based on standard LWE (or more broadly on the hardness of “General-LWE”). Although using the PVW method with LWE-based schemes leads to worse asymptotic efficiency than using the SV technique with ring-LWE schemes, the simplicity of this method may still offer some practical advantages. Also, the two techniques can be used in tandem with “general-LWE ” schemes, suggesting yet another tradeoff that can be optimized for different settings...|$|E
