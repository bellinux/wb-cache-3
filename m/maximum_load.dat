5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the <b>maximum</b> <b>load.</b> In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E

25|$|The {{balloons}} {{most commonly}} used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled balloons. Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic {{is used for the}} balloons. The balloons include propaganda messages written on the surface in Korean script. These balloons were developed to replace blimps previously used by the South Korean government, which were no longer being produced. After the balloons travel far enough across the border, a timer opens the plastic bags carried by the balloons. The balloons can travel up to 200kilometers, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> for each balloon is 10kilograms.

25|$|As {{a result}} of these efforts, President Roosevelt {{directed}} that the Presidential Unit Citation be awarded to the India-China Wing. Hardin was given a month's leave in the United States, promoted to brigadier general, and as the representative of the wing received the award from General Arnold on 29 January 1944, the first ever awarded to a non-combat unit. Hardin returned to the India China Wing in February 1944, just as the first of a trickle of four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports arrived in theater (see Operations on the low hump and in China below). With a <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> ceiling of only 12,000 feet the C-54s were unable to hurdle the high Hump. Japanese interceptors blocked use of eastbound routes at lower altitudes and the C-54s were limited for the time being to freight movement within India or flights between the CBI and the continental United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper utilises {{concavity}} {{properties in}} the optimal multiplier load flow method (OMLFM) {{to find the most}} suitable low voltage solution (LVS) for the systems having multiple LVS at the <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> point. In the previous method, the calculation of the optimal multiplier is based on only one remaining low voltage solution at the vicinity of voltage collapse point. However, this does not provide the best convergence for multi-low voltage solutions at the <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> point. Therefore, in this paper, concavity properties of the cost function in OMLFM are presented as the indicator to find the most suitable optimal multiplier {{in order to determine the}} most suitable low voltage solutions at the <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> point. The proposed method uses polar coordinate system instead of the rectangular coordinate system, which simplifies the task further and by keeping PV type buses. The polar coordinate in this method is based on the second order load flow equation in order to reduce the calculation time. The proposed method has been validated by the results obtained from the tests on the IEEE 57, 118 and 300 -bus systems for well-conditioned systems and at the <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> point...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} voltage {{stability in}} power systems when connected by wind farm generators. Two models of wind generator, namely squirrel cage induction generator and doubly fed induction generator are used {{and based on}} steadystate model. P-V curve is used to express <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> factor in power system when wind farm was installed. The test IEEE 14 bus system is selected to show proposed performance. The results of this paper can be shown that <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> factor before install wind farm generator is 0. 70398 p. u. The weakest bus is bus no. 14. Therefore, loading factor of system that connects two types of wind turbine with 7 m/s wind speed are 0. 8688 p. u and 0. 7997 p. u respectively. To improve the voltage stability, FACTS device is selected. The results show that STATCOM can improve <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> factor better SVC for both types of wind farm generator. <b>Maximum</b> <b>loading</b> factor increased when setting STATCOM up to 56. 33 % and 53. 28 % in systems that connected squirrel cage induction generator and doubly fed induction generator wind turbine respectively. Therefore, this methodology can give direct advantage for organization that are responsible to built convincing of power system in study the respond of setting wind turbine generator on voltage stability...|$|R
