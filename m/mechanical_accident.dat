40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>accidents</b> in petroleum enterprises {{is closely related}} to the operation of frontline workers. Based on the behavior observation method, the paper takes a petroleum enterprise as objective to identify the unsafe behavior of the operation workers and its contributing factors. The influences of the different factor on the mechanical operation are investigated by using the analytic hierarchy process. The results show that there are eight kinds of unsafe behaviors of the mechanical operation in the petroleum enterprise. The factors that induce the unsafe behaviors include safety knowledge, safety consciousness, emotion, physiological conditions, safety attitude, manager behavior, management system, production task and human environment. Among them, safety attitude, safety consciousness, manager behavior and production task are the most important factors. Therefore, the safety production capacity of the frontline workers in petroleum enterprises should be improved through safety education training, manager lead demonstration, enterprise safety culture construction...|$|R

I. WOUND HEALING Skin is a vital organ, {{in the sense that}} the loss of substantial fraction of its mass immediately threatens the life of the individual. A cutaneous wound is any loss of skin integrity.

He began his racing career in the late 1920s, driving his own privately entered Hupmobile in local circuit and hillclimb events. He soon graduated to a true racing car, buying a Bugatti Type 35B from compatriot Count Tivadar Zichy in 1929. With this and another of his own Bugattis - a Type 37A sports car bought in 1930 - he began to enter more prestigious and challenging European events in addition to those in his home country. Hartmann regularly featured in the top five finishers at most European hillclimb events in the following few years, and in 1930 he took second place overall in the European Mountain Championship series. His performances caught the Bugatti factory's eye and they occasionally lent him a more powerful Type 51, with which he won the hillclimb events at Guggenberg in 1932 and 1933.

Predictive analytics are statistical methods (predictive modeling, machine learning, data mining) analyzing current and historical data to make predictions about the future. This is an intense area of research for experts in medical informatics. The complexity of predictive algorithms is limitless, but the principle is simple: The combination of several parameters (usually vital signs) and the automatic recognition of specific patterns allow the detection of adverse events, earlier than the classical side-by-side monitoring of single parameters [49]. Lockheed Martin, the American aerospace and defense leader, claims {{it is able to}} diagnose sepsis 14 – 16  h before doctors [50], by monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and body temperature and using smart algorithms they initially developed to predict… the trajectory of missiles! Other algorithms have been developed to predict cardiorespiratory deterioration [51]. In this regard, predictive analytics may be useful to trigger the intervention of a rapid response team (RRT) and accelerate ICU admission (for patients in the ward or the emergency department) or to postpone ICU discharge for patients who are about to leave the unit. The simplification of monitoring systems, becoming smaller, smarter [52] and even wireless [53 – 55], should boost the clinical applicability of predictive analytics. Although a very exciting and promising research field, one have to acknowledge that these systems {{will never be able to}} predict the unpredictable, i.e., external interventions (vasoactive or inotropic drugs administration, <b>mechanical</b> ventilation) or <b>accidents</b> (surgical bleeding due to vessel injury) which are often the cause for changes in hemodynamic status and patient outcome.|$|R

40|$|As {{the most}} common {{mechanisms}} for transmitting power and motion, gears and bearings {{have been widely used}} in various <b>mechanical</b> equipment. Many <b>accidents</b> have happened because of failing to detect and replace the faulty gears or bearings in time. Hence {{it is very important to}} perform accurate fault diagnosis of gears and bearings. When a gear or bearing has a fault, the vibration signal collected from the mechanical equipment will become non-stationary and contain a series of periodic impulses that are caused by the fault. Many theories and techniques have been developed to extract the faulty information based on analyzing periodic impulses contained in the vibration signals. It has been reported that neither time-domain analysis nor frequency-domain analysis can do well in analyzing non-stationary signals. Hence time-frequency analysis methods based on wavelet transform and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) have been investigated. Wavelet transform includes continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Research was reported to compare the performance of these methods in fault diagnosis of mechanical components. However, the previous works either only compared HHT based methods with CWT based methods, or only compared HHT based methods with DWT based methods, for certain applications. There are no reported comprehensive comparisons of the three methods for fault diagnosis of gears and bearings. Cepstrum analysis can detect the periodicity and reduce the influence of the noise for the low energy signals. However, previous research usually only applied Cepstrum analysis directly to extract fault features from the entire original signal. Some other existing methods first applied DWT to decompose the original signal to obtain the detail signals, and then used Hilbert spectral analysis to analyze the periodic impulses contained in the detail signals through identifying faulty characteristic frequency with frequency domain analysis and plotting the instantaneous amplitude with time domain analysis. Hilbert spectral analysis has the advantage in frequency domain analysis. However, sometimes it is not very sensitive in time domain analysis when the energy of the periodic impulses is not strong enough. In this thesis, we investigate fault diagnosis of gears and bearings using two sets of vibration monitoring data collected in the lab environment: one set for gear condition monitoring and the other for bearing condition monitoring. We propose an improved DWT method that integrates Cepstrum analysis to analyze the periodic impulses contained in the data. With the proposed method, the vibration signals are first decomposed using DWT, and Cepstrum analysis is used to analyze the resulting detail signals. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods of applying Cepstrum analysis directly. Furthermore, with the help of Cepstrum analysis, the proposed method has better performance in time domain analysis than Hilbert spectral analysis in analyzing the periodic impulses contained in the detail signals. A comprehensive study is conducted in this thesis to compare the following three methods in fault diagnosis of the gears and bearings: (1) The CWT method using time-wavelet energy spectrum, (2) the improved DWT method using Cepstrum analysis, and (3) the HHT method. The results show that in fault diagnosis of gears, the HHT method has better noise immunity and is more sensitive in frequency domain analysis than the other two methods. The proposed method shows its advantage in analyzing the periodic impulses in time domain than the other two methods. In fault diagnosis of the bearings, the fault can be more clearly detected using the CWT and DWT methods in analyzing the periodic impulse that caused by the outer race fault of the bearing. The results obtained in this thesis can assist researchers and practitioners to select suitable methods for fault diagnosis of gears and bearings...|$|R
