5|$|After his {{graduation}} from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received {{a full scholarship}} to attend Duke University School of Law. The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.

The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.

5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and {{a gust of}} 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly as high as 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage.

5|$|Pennsylvania, {{which had}} {{abolished}} slavery in 1780, required any slaves {{brought to the}} city to be freed after six months' residency. The state law was challenged by French colonial refugees from Saint-Domingue, who brought slaves with them, but defended by the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Through 1796, 500 slaves from Saint-Domingue gained freedom in the city. Because of the violence accompanying the revolution on the island, Philadelphians, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> southern ties, and residents of the Upper South worried that free people of color would encourage slave insurrections in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The Christian {{religion}} {{is based on}} the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus. Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (<b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, {{within striking distance of}} a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, {{the population in the}} north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
5|$|On 28 April 1910, French pilot Louis Paulhan landed his Farman biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm, on {{the borders}} of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury, {{at the end of}} the first flight from London to Manchester in under 24hours, with one short {{overnight}} stop at Lichfield. Arriving at 5:30am, Paulhan beat the British contender, Claude Grahame-White, winning a £10,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail. This was the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city. Two special trains were chartered to the newly built but unopened Burnage railway station to take spectators to the landing, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> stood throughout the night. Paulhan's progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife, Henri Farman and his mechanics. Afterwards his train took the party to a civic reception given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in the town hall. A house in Paulhan Road, constructed in the 1930s near the site of his landing, is marked by a blue plaque to commemorate his achievement.|$|E
