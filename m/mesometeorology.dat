5000|$|Microscale thermal plumes, whose diameters may be {{measured}} in tens of metres, such as those produced by industrial chimney stacks, have been extensively investigated, but largely {{from the point of}} view of the plumes dispersal by local micrometeorology. [...] Though their velocity is generally less, their very much greater magnitude (diameter) means that urban thermal plumes will have a more significant effect upon the <b>mesometeorology</b> and even continental macrometeorology.|$|E
50|$|An urban thermal plume {{describes}} rising air in {{the lower}} altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere caused by urban areas being warmer than surrounding areas. Over {{the past thirty years}} there has been increasing interest in what have been called urban heat island (UHI), but it is only since 2007 that thought has been given to the rising columns of warm air, or ‘thermal plumes’ that they produce. We are all familiar with on-shore breezes at the seaside on a warm day, and off-shore breezes at night. These are caused by the land heating up faster on a sunny day and cooling faster after sunset, respectively. Our personal experience of on-shore breezes shows us that the thermals, or warm airs, that rise from the land and sea respectively have a sensible effect on the local microscale meteorology; and perhaps at times on the <b>mesometeorology.</b> Urban thermal plumes have as powerful although less localized an effect.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>mesometeorology</b> are summarized to place this research in perspective. Recent advances in computer analysis and forecast system development {{that provide the}} basis for the simulation tests are discussed. The impact of NIMBUS- 6 humidity data on analyses off the West Coast are shown and incorporation of geopotential gradient data is discussed. Experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating satellite-derived wind fields in mesoscale severe storm models are mentioned briefly...|$|E
40|$|Highlights {{of recent}} {{progress}} and the directions of future {{advances in the}} application of space observations to weather and climate are reviewed. In <b>mesometeorology</b> and severe storms, satellite stereography of cloud topography and temperature profiling from GOES-VAS promise dramatic developments in both nowcasting and prediction. In global weather, the initial results from the year long Global Weather Experiment conclusively demonstrate the enhanced forecast skill emanating from the use of satellite data, especially cloud track winds and temperature profiles. In climate, empirical studies and numerical experiments point to the feasibility of useful climate predictions on monthly and seasonal time scales. They also indicate the kinds of surface boundary conditions to which climate is sensitive and which need to be observed from space...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the recent}} {{analytical}} studies of <b>mesometeorology,</b> it becomes obvious that thenearly axisymmetric vortices such as the tornadoes and the severe convective meso cyclones aresometimes superposed by non-axisymmetric disturbances. This phenomenon has been also simulat-ed in the laboratory experiments and is called 'multiple vortex phenomenon'. The similar non-axisymmetric disturbance {{has been found in}} the Typhoon vortex. Several {{attempts have been made to}} explain this phenomenon theoretically. However, theinstalibity of the disturbance of azimuthal wavenumber two has been rather uncertain. In thepresent study. The stability of the axisymmetric vortex is examined. The basic vortex is postulatedto have a negative vorticity region just outside the radius of maximum tangential wind velocity. Using this model, it is verified that the disturbance of wavenumber two could be destablized. Andthis result is compared with the elliptical eye wall of the Second Miyakojima Typhoon...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC 2) {{model is}} a {{production}} quality weather forecast model widely used in Canadian Universities and Environment Canada for mesoscale and microscale atmospheric research [3]. The {{model is a}}n extension of a fully compressible limited area model developed by Tanguay, Robert and Laprise in the mid- 1980 's at Recherche en pr'evision num'erique (RPN) and l'Universit'e du Qu'ebec `a Montr'eal (UQAM) [35]. The MC 2 model dynamics and physics code libraries along with related support software are maintained by RPN 1 Corresponding author: steve. thomas@ec. gc. ca Preprint submitted to Parallel Computing 27 May for the Cooperative Center for Research in <b>Mesometeorology</b> (CCRM). Recent research projects based on MC 2 include the development of a microphysics package by researchers at McGill University in Montr'eal [19]. The small-scale prediction capabilities of the model have also been tested as part of...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in <b>mesometeorology</b> and computer technology, high-resolution numerical simulations of small-scale severe weather events remain extremely challenging. This is {{primarily due to}} insufficient initial conditions and inadequate convective parameterization schemes (CPSs). This thesis serves to illustrate how these difficulties may be overcome in a real-data simulation of the Garden City, Kansas, tornadic thunderstorm, which occurred during the VORTEX (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment) field experiment of 1995. Using a sophisticated mesoscale model at 18 km horizontal resolution, a successful reproduction of the environment over southwestern Kansas is obtained. However, modifications to the CPS are required to trigger the Garden City storm at the correct time and location. Utilizing severe weather parameters, {{it is found that}} the simulated atmosphere is susceptible to tornadic supercells. The results of a sensitivity study also indicate that a neighbouring storm may have influenced tornadogenesis in the Garden City supercell...|$|E
