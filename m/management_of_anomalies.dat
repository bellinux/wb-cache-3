40|$|We {{present a}} case of early {{prenatal}} diagnosis of recurrent 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis, by combining early genetic and sonographic evaluations. The conceptus of a mother with a first child affected by 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis was sonographically evaluated at 21 - and 23 -mm BPD (12 (+ 2) and 12 (+ 6) LMP-based age) and the female genitalia were observed. Karyotype analyses was performed on amniotic fluid and it revealed a 46,XY complement without mosaicism. SRY was amplified by PCR for molecular analyses. We observed a discordance between female phenotype detected at 21 and 23 mm of biparietal diameter (12 (+ 2) and 12 (+ 6) LMP-based age) and male karyotype. In {{the child and the}} fetus, seminiferous cords were not recognisable, whereas rare Leydig cells and no germ cells could be identified. Internal and external genitalia were sexually ambiguous in the child and feminized in the fetus. This is the first case of early prenatal diagnosis of recurrent 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis and it points to the importance of combining early analyses of genetic sex with sonography in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> of sexual development, with particular regard to syndromes for which the risk of recurrence is little understood...|$|E
40|$|The postemergent {{herbicide}} propanil (PRN; {{also known}} as 3, 4 -dichloropropionanilide) is used on rice and wheat crops and has well-known immunotoxic effects on various compartments of the immune system, including T-helper lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. It is unclear, however, whether PRN also adversely affects cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), the primary (1 °) effectors of cell-mediated immunity. In this study we examined both the direct and indirect effects of PRN exposure on CTL activation and effector cell function to gauge its likely impact on cellmediated immunity. Initial experiments addressed whether PRN alters the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway for antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby indirectly affecting effector function. These experiments demonstrated that PRN does not impair the activation of CTLs by PRN-treated APCs. Subsequent experiments addressed whether PRN treatment of CTLs directly inhibits their activation and revealed that 1 ° alloreactive CTLs exposed to PRN are unimpaired in their proliferative response and only marginally inhibited in their lytic activity. Surprisingly, secondary stimulation of these alloreactive CTL effectors, however, {{even in the absence}} of further PRN exposure, resulted in complete abrogation of CTL lytic function and a delayed but significant long-term effect on CTL responsiveness. These findings may have important implications for the diagnosis and clinical <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> of cell-mediated immunity resulting from environmental exposure to various herbicides and other pesticides.

40|$|Introduction: Vascular {{anomalies}} are congenital lesions broadly categorised into {{vascular tumour}} (haemangiomas) and vascular dysmorphogenesis (vascular malformation). The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> these difficult problems has lately been simplified by the biological classification and multidisciplinary approach. To standardise the treatment protocol, an algorithm has been devised. The study aims {{to validate the}} algorithm {{in terms of its}} utility and presents our experience in managing vascular anomalies. Materials and Methods: The biological classification of Mulliken and Glowacki was followed. A detailed algorithm for <b>management</b> <b>of</b> vascular <b>anomalies</b> has been devised in the department. The protocol is being practiced by us since the past two decades. The data regarding the types of lesions and treatment modality used were maintained. Results and Conclusion: This study was conducted from 2002 to 2012. A total of 784 cases <b>of</b> vascular <b>anomalies</b> were included in the study of which 196 were haemangiomas and 588 were vascular malformations. The algorithmic approach has brought an element of much-needed objectivity in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> vascular <b>anomalies.</b> This has helped us to define the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> particular lesion considering its pathology, extent and aesthetic and functional consequences of ablation to a certain extent...|$|R
40|$|Opitz G BBB {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} condition characterized by the 3 major <b>anomalies</b> <b>of</b> hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, and hypospadias, although {{there may be other}} associated anomalies. The underlying genetic causes are complex and consist of both X-linked recessive and autosomal dominant forms of the disorder. Previously, there have been publications on the underlying genetics and case reports, but there have been few reports regarding the long-term outcome. The aim in this study was to review the range of clinical presentation and evaluate outcomes <b>of</b> the multidisciplinary <b>management</b> <b>of</b> a cohort of patients with Opitz G BBB syndrome. In a 25 -year period, 7 patients with Opitz G BBB syndrome were managed by the Australian Craniofacial Unit (ACFU), 5 male and 2 female. Most of the patients are now reaching skeletal maturity. Each one presented with a range of severity in the triad of hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, and hypospadias anomalies. The males all exhibited the triad <b>of</b> <b>anomalies,</b> while the females both had hypertelorism, only 1 had isolated cleft palate, and neither had any genitourinary anomalies. Each patient underwent multidisciplinary assessment to make a treatment plan for staged <b>management</b> <b>of</b> different <b>anomalies.</b> Plan for surgical corrections <b>of</b> facial <b>anomalies</b> were performed according to the unit's protocol <b>management</b> <b>of</b> both hypertelorism and cleft lip and palate, but the presence <b>of</b> these coexisting <b>anomalies</b> required adjustment <b>of</b> the standard protocol <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> cleft lip and palate.

ABSTRACT: This study sought to determine the state <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> binocular vision <b>anomalies</b> by eye care facilities in two major cities in Ghana: Accra and Kumasi. Using the snow balling technique, 86 eye care centres were sampled from the two cities from January to February, 2014. Well-structured questionnaires, verbal interviews {{and in most cases}} observational check-ups were employed in the data collection process. Out of the 86 clinics, 51 (59. 3 %) were located in the Accra metropolis. Binocular Vision Anomalies were reported to be managed by 63 (73. 3 %) clinics. Majority of the clinics (69. 8 %) managed accommodative dysfunction with added lenses (69. 8 %) being the most-employed method. Overall, 79 (91. 9 %) clinics reported that they referred unmanaged cases and mostly to the ophthalmologist (55. 7 %). It was found that reports of adequate training in <b>management</b> <b>of</b> binocular vision <b>anomalies</b> and number <b>of</b> instruments owned by the clinics were positively associated with <b>management</b> <b>of</b> binocular vision <b>anomalies</b> (p value = 0. 001 and p value = 0. 000 respectively). Based on the report of the clinics, it could be concluded that although some form <b>of</b> binocular vision <b>anomalies</b> are managed by most clinics, there is possibly lack of efficient provision of services as most clinics lacked instruments that are required in detecting, measuring and managing Binocular vision anomalies. It is therefore recommended that to ensure provision of more efficient and quality binocular vision services to clients, eye clinics in the country should endeavour to obtain th...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The key to {{successful}} <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the rudimentary uterine horn is early detection.

Methods of study selections: One hundred thirty letters, case reports, case series, and review articles featuring rudimentary uterine horn were found.

40|$|Background: Congenital hand {{anomalies}} {{are numerous}} and markedly variant.

All of them had main airway obstruction. Surgical division and re-anastomosis of the anomalous artery in front of the trachea produced an unsatisfactory result in the first two patients. The only surgical procedure undertaken in the subsequent five patients was division of a ligamentum arteriosum; this formed part of a compressing ring in one patient. Three patients, one of whom had associated tracheobronchial stenosis, became completely asymptomatic.
