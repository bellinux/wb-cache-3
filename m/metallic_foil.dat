5|$|On December 17, 2007 it was {{announced}} that Crisis Core would be released in North America on March 25, 2008. If pre-ordered from certain retailers, such as GameStop, the buyer may receive a Shinra UMD case, depending on how long supplies lasted; if pre-ordered from Best Buy, the buyer may receive Crisis Core with a <b>metallic</b> <b>foil</b> cover. Two versions of the game were released in Europe: a standard edition, and a limited edition, which was only available online, and then only when pre-ordered. This limited edition included special slipcase packaging and a book of promotional CG artwork entitled The Art of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. In Europe, a bundle containing the game and the limited edition Crisis Core-engraved silver PlayStation Portable was released on June 20. As with several games from the company, Square released an Ultimania guidebook in Japan, on October 18, 2007.|$|E

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{or plastic}} film capacitors are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric. The dielectric films {{are drawn to}} a thin layer, provided with metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or {{both sides of the}} plastic film, resulting in metallized film capacitors or a separate <b>metallic</b> <b>foil</b> overlying the film, called film/foil capacitors.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of paper insulated bushings, <b>metallic</b> <b>foils</b> can be inserted during the winding process. These act to stabilize the generated electrical fields, homogenising the internal energy using the effect of capacitance. This feature resulted in the Condenser/Capacitor bushing.|$|R
40|$|BaNd 2 Ti 5 O 14 (BNT) films 12 - 52 mu m thick were {{fabricated}} on platinum <b>metallic</b> <b>foils</b> by {{electrophoretic deposition}} (EPD). 52 -mu m-thick BNT film exhibits a dielectric constant {{and a loss}} tangent of 107 and 0. 0006 (Q of 1600) at 1 MHz, respectively. Variation in permittivity is less than 0. 02 % at a bias voltage +/- 8 kV/cm. Change of film permittivity with temperature (30 - 120 degrees C) is below + 58. 5 ppm/degrees C, pointing to a good thermal stability. Preliminary microwave measurements indicate that the losses are not significantly increased up to the gigahertz regime. EPD derived BNT thick films on <b>metallic</b> <b>foils</b> are attractive candidates for microwave communication devices...|$|R

25|$|The {{dielectric}} films, {{depending on}} the desired dielectric strength, are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc applied directly {{to the surface of}} the plastic film, or a separate <b>metallic</b> <b>foil.</b> Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on a printed circuit board, or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body. Film capacitors, together with ceramic capacitors and electrolytic capacitors, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic equipment, and are used in many AC and DC microelectronics and electronics circuits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{low-cost}} experimental apparatus {{has been}} developed to investigate the Mode I fatigue crack growth behavior of thin <b>metallic</b> <b>foils</b> and sheets. The apparatus utilizes magnetic coupling between a ceramic magnet and a rotating steel disk to induce cyclic tensile loads in notched rectangular test specimens. To illustrate the testing apparatus, Mode I fatigue crack growth in 30 �m thick high purity titanium foils was studied. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature using a loading frequency of 2 Hz and a nominal stress ratio of 0. 1. The cyclic crack growth data could be fit to a Paris relationship between crack growth rate and stress-intensity range. The stress intensity factor exponent, m, in the Paris relationship was between 4 and 5, which {{is comparable to the}} relatively high values found in the literature for the tension-tension fatigue of other metallic bulk materials. Self-similarity analysis was used to explain the observed higher m values for thin <b>metallic</b> <b>foils...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{banknote}} {{was unveiled}} and released into circulation {{at a national}} ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, and also at several regional events, on 7 November 2012. On 9 September 2016, the Bank of Canada released {{a modified version of}} the banknote to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. It is derived from the standard $20 Frontier Series banknote, but replaces the images on the <b>metallic</b> <b>foil</b> with the royal cypher of Elizabeth II and a portrait of Elizabeth II adapted from a 1951 photograph by Yousuf Karsh. It was the first Canadian banknote to depict Elizabeth II wearing a tiara. This portrait was also used for the obverse of all banknotes of the 1954 Series, including both variants of the Centennial $1 banknote issued in 1967 for the Canadian Centennial, but the engraving created for those banknotes excluded the tiara.|$|E
500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{fan base}} supporting California Chrome became visible at the Santa Anita Derby, when someone invited the horse's supporters {{to join the}} owners in the winner's circle and over 100 people crammed into the area, including one woman dressed entirely in <b>metallic</b> <b>foil.</b> [...] Coburn told CNN of a supporter who had a jackass tattooed on his shoulder. An unofficial Twitter account for the horse, @CalChrome, was started by a 37-year-old fan from Florida, Shawn LaFata, had over 12,000 followers by Belmont week. The New York Times noted the enthusiasm of the fans, who used the hashtag #Chromies on Twitter. LaFata believes the word [...] "Chromies" [...] first appeared on @CalChrome eight nights before the Kentucky Derby. The humble origins of the horse and {{the people around him}} played a role in his popularity, as did the horse's people-focused attitude. Supporters appeared to be further motivated by the continuing doubts raised by industry experts about California Chrome's ability.|$|E
500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a <b>metallic</b> <b>foil</b> and screening.|$|E
