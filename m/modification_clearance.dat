40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} reversible focal pleural thickenings (PTs) mimicking real plaques, that firstly suggest asbestos exposure or pleural metastasis; to propose an imaging strategy and propose an explanation for their mechanism of formation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of data from 19 patients with PTs fitting the description of pleural plaques at chest computed tomography (CT) and presenting <b>modifications</b> (<b>clearance</b> or appearance) {{of at least one}} PT at an additional chest examination in prone position. RESULTS: A total of 152 PTs were recorded on the first chest CT examinations with a range of two to 19 pleural opacities per patient. All PTs had a posterior distribution in the lower lobes. On the additional acquisitions, 144 PTs disappeared. Seventeen patients presented complete regression of PTs and two patients presented persistence of eight PTs. CONCLUSION: Additional low dose acquisition in prone position should be performed in all patients presenting with focal PT in a dependent and basal location. This may allow to exclude a pleural plaque in case of asbestos exposure but also a pleural metastasis in oncologic patients. These reversible dependent PTs could be related to physiological focal accumulation of lymphatic fluid in subpleural area...|$|R

40|$|Protein glycation adducts, early glycation adducts, such as N εε-fructosyl-lysine, and {{advanced}} glycation end products (AGEs) are uremic toxins. Glycation adducts {{are found in}} plasma and tissue proteins (glycation adduct residues), in peptides (glycation adduct peptide residues), and glycated amino acids (glycation free adducts). The latter two analyte groups arise from proteolysis of glycated proteins and glycation of peptides and amino acids. Quantitation of glycation adducts in uremia is difficult {{because of the presence}} of many different AGEs at low concentrations in different forms in the presence of many potential interferences. Application of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection to plasma, urine, and dialysate samples of uremic patients has provided a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of glycation adducts in uremia. Glycation free adducts accumulate markedly in the plasma of uremic patients and are eliminated in the peritoneal dialysate. Multiple glycation adducts, and also protein oxidation and nitration adducts, may be quantified concurrently. Glycation free adducts are the major form of glycation adduct eliminated in dialysate. LC-MS/MS may now be used to quantify concentrations, extents of protein <b>modification,</b> <b>clearances,</b> and excretion rates of glycation adducts in uremia.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} altered lineage-specific expression of an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene, Galgt 2, as the gain-of-function mechanism {{responsible for the}} action of the Mvwf locus, a major modifier of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) level in RIIIS/J mice. A switch of Galgt 2 gene expression from intestinal epithelial cell-specific to a pattern restricted to the vascular endothelial cell bed leads to aberrant posttranslational <b>modification</b> and rapid <b>clearance</b> of VWF from plasma. Transgenic expression of Galgt 2 directed to vascular endothelial cells reproduces the low VWF phenotype, confirming this switch in lineage-specific gene expression as the likely molecular mechanism for Mvwf.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} and concentrations of modified proteins circulating in plasma depend on rates of protein synthesis, <b>modification</b> and <b>clearance.</b> In early studies, the proteins most frequently analysed for damage were those which were more abundant in plasma (e. g. albumin and immunoglobulins) which exist {{at up to}} 10 orders of magnitude higher concentrations than other plasma proteins e. g. cytokines. However, advances in analytical techniques using mass spectrometry and immuno-affinity purification methods, have facilitated analysis of less abundant, modified proteins {{and the nature of}} modifications at specific sites is now being characterised. The damaging reactive species that cause protein modifications in plasma principally arise from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidases (NOX), nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and oxygenase activities; reactive nitrogen species (RNS) from myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NOS activities; and hypochlorous acid from MPO. Secondary damage to proteins may be caused by oxidized lipids and glucose autooxidation. In this review, we focus on redox regulatory control of those enzymes and processes which control protein maturation during synthesis, produce reactive species, repair and remove damaged plasma proteins. We have highlighted the potential for alterations in the extracellular redox compartment to regulate intracellular redox state and, conversely, for intracellular oxidative stress to alter the cellular secretome and composition of extracellular vesicles. Through secreted, redox-active regulatory molecules, changes in redox state may be transmitted to distant sites...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of native}} {{riparian}} vegetation and its replacement with non-native species or grazing land for agriculture is a worldwide phenomenon, {{but one that}} is prevalent in Europe, reflecting the heavily-modified nature of the continent's landscape. The consequences of these riparian alterations for freshwater ecosystems remain largely unknown, largely because bioassessment has traditionally focused on the impacts of organic pollution on community structure. We addressed {{the need for a}} broader perspective, which encompasses changes at the catchment scale, by comparing ecosystem processes in woodland reference sites with those with altered riparian zones. We assessed a range of riparian <b>modifications,</b> including <b>clearance</b> for pasture and replacement of woodland with a range of low diversity plantations, in 100 streams to obtain a continental-scale perspective of the major types of alterations across Europe. Subsequently, we focused on pasture streams, as an especially prevalent widespread riparian alteration, by characterising their structural (e. g. invertebrate and fish communities) and functional (e. g. litter decomposition, algal production, herbivory) attributes in a country (Ireland) dominated by this type of landscape modification, via field and laboratory experiments. We found that microbes became increasingly important as agents of decomposition relative to macrofauna (invertebrates) in impacted sites in general and in pasture streams in particular. Resource quality of grass litter (e. g., carbon : nutrient ratios, lignin and cellulose content) was a key driver of decomposition rates in pasture streams. These systems also relied more heavily on autochthonous algal production than was the case in woodland streams, which were more detrital based. These findings suggest that these pasture streams might be fundamentally different from their native, ancestral woodland state, with a shift towards greater reliance on autochthonous-based processes. This could have a destabilizing effect on the dynamics of the food web relative to the slower, detrital-based pathways that dominate in woodland streams...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Obstacle {{crossing}} is compromised following stroke. The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantify <b>modifications</b> during obstacle <b>clearance</b> following stroke. Subjects. Twelve subjects with stroke and 12 subjects without stroke participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic variables were measured while participants crossed a 4 -cm-high obstacle. Subjects with stroke walked at a self-selected speed; subjects without stroke walked at a comparable speed and at a self-selected speed. Results. Several modifications were observed following stroke with both groups walking at self-selected speeds. The affected lead limb was positioned closer to the obstacle before crossing. Affected trail-limb clearance over the obstacle was reduced. Both affected and unaffected lead and trail limbs landed closer to the obstacle after clearance. Swing time was increased in the affected lead limb after obstacle <b>clearance.</b> Fewer <b>modifications</b> were detected at matched walking speed; the trail limb still landed closer to the obstacle. Discussion and Conclusion. Modifications during obstacle crossing following stroke may be partly related to walking speed. The findings raise issues of safety because people with stroke demonstrated reduced clearance of a 4 -cm obstacle and limb placement closer to the obstacle after clearance.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a wide number of results {{about the influence}} that variations in terms of operational and design parameters play on the dynamic behaviour of external gear pumps. These results are obtained by using a non-linear lumped-parameter kineto-elastodynamic model developed and experimentally assessed {{with the aim of}} including all the important dynamic effects. On the one hand, the effects of variations in the operational parameters - namely output pressure, rotational speed and oil viscosity - are analysed; on the other hand, the effects of modifications of some design parameters are shown: clearances and relief groove dimension. The results in terms of gear eccentricity, pressure evolution, pressure forces, gear accelerations and variable forces exciting the pump casing enlighten the dynamic behaviour of gear pumps and give useful indications for design improvements and vibration and noise reduction. As regards specifically gear accelerations as well as forces exciting the casing, they strongly increase with both output pressure and rotational speed, but variations in rotational speed in the operational range give lower effects. Conversely, the <b>modifications</b> of the <b>clearances</b> give negligible effects, while the relief groove dimension is very important: the larger the relief grooves are, the higher the gear accelerations and forces exciting the casing become...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot-in-the-loop {{aircraft}} taxi simulation was to evaluate a NextGen concept for surface trajectory-based operations (STBO) in which air traffic control (ATC) issued taxi clearances with a required time of arrival (RTA) by Data Communications (DataComm). Flight deck avionics, driven by an error-nulling algorithm, displayed the speed needed to meet the RTA. To ensure robustness of the algorithm, the ability of 10 two-pilot crews to meet the RTA was tested in nine experimental trials representing a range of realistic conditions including a taxi route change, an RTA change, a departure clearance change, and a crossing traffic hold scenario. In some trials, these DataComm taxi <b>clearances</b> or <b>clearance</b> <b>modifications</b> were accompanied by preview information, in which the airport map display showed {{a preview of the}} proposed route changes, including the necessary speed to meet the RTA. Overall, {{the results of this study}} show that with the aid of the RTA speed algorithm, pilots were able to meet their RTAs with very little time error in all of the robustness-testing scenarios.

Six smokers, six ex-smokers, and three non-smokers (12 men and three women, median age 60 years) were studied. Eight subjects had chronic obstructive lung disease (median FEV 1 46 % predicted) and seven had asthma (FEV 1 70 % predicted). Seven subjects produced sputum regularly, two of whom had asthma. Clearance of secretions was measured by an inhaled radioaerosol technique. The number of coughs and the wet weight, radioactive content, and mean apparent viscosity of sputum produced during the six hour observation period were recorded, as was the mean wet weight of sputum produced during the last two 24 hour periods ending each treatment. Comparison with placebo showed that treatment with high dose ipratropium bromide was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} penetration index of inhaled particles, but there was no significant change in alveolar deposition of particles or in tracheobronchial clearance, uncorrected or corrected for sputum expectorated. The wet weight of sputum produced, its radioactive content, and mean apparent viscosity were similar after treatment with ipratropium bromide and placebo.

The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is {{proposed}} to implement efficacious and costeffective control strategies. However, the evidence-base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for 2 decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation <b>clearance,</b> <b>modification</b> of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also benefited from quinine administration and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve {{a high level of}} performance. Within 3 - 5 years, malariarelated mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70 - 95 %. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4, 173 deaths and 161, 205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US$ 858 and US$ 22. 20, respectively. Over the initial 3 - 5 year start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US$ 524 - 591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower; US$ 22 - 92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{in vitro}} techniques, {{the present study}} {{demonstrates}} that CYP 2 D 6, and 3 A 4 are involved in N-demethylation of citalopram (CIT) enantiomers. Human liver microsome incubations performed with specific inhibitors of these three CYP isozymes have shown up to 60 % inhibition of demethylcitalopram production. cDNA expressed human cytochrome P- 450 3 A 4, 2 C 19 and 2 D 6 isozymes, but not CYP 1 A 2, were identified {{to be involved in}} N-demethylation of CIT enantiomers. Kinetics using cDNA expressed CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 3 A 4 show K(m) values in the same range: 198 microM, 211 microM for CYP 2 C 19 and 169 microM, 163 microM for CYP 3 A 4 for S- and R-CIT demethylation, respectively. In contrast, kinetics using cDNA expressed CYP 2 D 6 show a K(m) of 18 microM and 22 microM for S- and R-CIT demethylation, respectively. Nevertheless, kinetics using cDNA expressed CYP 2 C 19 and 3 A 4 have a range of Vmax values ten times higher than that of CYP 2 D 6. For this reason, intrinsic clearance values (Vmax/K(m)) for S- and R-CIT were within a small range for these three isozymes: 0. 25 to 0. 39 microliter h- 1 x pmol- 1 of CYP. CYP 2 D 6 has an opposite stereoselectivity in the biotransformation of CIT enantiomers than CYP 2 C 19 and 3 A 4; the S/R ratios of the intrinsic clearance were 0. 71, 1. 57 and 1. 37, respectively. Taking into account that CYP isozymes are expressed at various levels, CYP 2 D 6, which is expressed at lower levels than CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 3 A 4, plays a minor role in the biotransformation of CIT enantiomers. These results confirm that the use of cDNA expressed CYP isozymes is a potent tool for the measurement of kinetic constants and help to predict <b>clearance</b> <b>modifications</b> of CIT enantiomers, especially in poor metabolizers of mephenytoin (with a CYP 2 C 19 deficiency) or patients comedicated with potent CYP 2 C 19 or 3 A 4 inhibitor(s).

40|$|Introduction: The best modality, for {{continuous}} renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is currently uncertain {{and it is}} poorly understood how transport of different solutes, whether convective or diffusive, changes over time. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross over study in a cohort of critically ill patients, comparing small (urea and creatinine) and middle (β 2 microglobulin) molecular weight solute clearance, filter lifespan and membrane performance {{over a period of}} 72 hours, during 15 continuous veno-venous dialysis (CVVHD) and 15 continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) sessions. Both modalities were administered based on a prescription of 35 ml/kg/h and using polyacrylonitrile filters. Results: Median filter lifespan was significantly longer during CVVHD (37 hours, interquartile range (IQR) 19. 5 to 72. 5) than CVVH (19 hours, IQR 12. 5 to 28) (p = 0. 03). Median urea time weighted average (TWA) clearances were not significantly different during CVVH (31. 6 ml/minute, IQR 23. 2 to 38. 9) and CVVHD (35. 7 ml/minute, IQR 30. 1 to 41. 5) (p = 0. 213). Similar results were found for creatinine: 38. 1 ml/minute, IQR 28. 5 to 39, and 35. 6 ml/minute, IQR 26 to 43 (p = 0. 917), respectively. Median β 2 m TWA clearance was higher during convective (16. 3 ml/minute, IQR 10. 9 to 23) than diffusive (6. 27 ml/minute, IQR 1. 6 to 14. 9) therapy; nonetheless this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0. 055). Median TWA adsorptive clearance of β 2 m appeared to have scarce impact on overall solute removal (0. 012 ml/minute, IQR - 0. 09 to 0. 1, during hemofiltration versus - 0. 016 ml/minute, IQR - 0. 08 to 0. 1 during dialysis; p = 0. 79). Analysis of <b>clearance</b> <b>modification</b> over time did not show significant modifications of urea, creatinine and β 2 m clearance in the first 48 hours during both treatments. In the CVVHD group, the only significant difference was found for β 2 m between 72 hours and baseline clearance. Conclusion: Polyacrylonitrile filters during continuous hemofiltration and continuous hemodialysis delivered at 35 ml/kg/h are comparable in little and middle size solute removal. CVVHD appears to warrant longer CRRT sessions. The capacity of both modalities for removing such molecules is maintained up to 48 hours. © 2006 Ricci et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} {{determinants of}} baseline peritoneal membrane (PM) transport characteristics, as evaluated by a hypertonic peritoneal equilibration test (PET), remain ill-defined. Likewise, the longitudinal evolution of PM transport properties in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients given automated PD (APD) and icodextrin {{still needs to}} be determined precisely. The aims of the present study were (1) to determine the clinical and biological factors affecting PM transport characteristics at PD onset and (2) to assess the longitudinal evolution of these markers. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients performed a baseline 3. 86 % glucose dialysate PET and were enrolled. Subgroups of 35 and 18 patients underwent another PET 1 and 2 year(s) later, respectively, and were included in the longitudinal part. For each patient, clinical and biological data were reviewed and PM transport markers calculated. RESULTS: At onset of PD, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor intake (r = 0. 31, P = 0. 01), presence of a diabetes (r = 0. 26, P = 0. 03) and body surface area (BSA) (r = 0. 26, P = 0. 03) independently affected the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) of creatinine. Serum albumin (r = - 0. 46, P< 0. 001) and net ultrafiltration (r = - 0. 33, P = 0. 009) inversely correlated with MTAC creatinine. Sodium sieving was inversely correlated with BSA (r = - 0. 33, P = 0. 01). Serum albumin also inversely correlated with albumin clearance (r = - 0. 39, P = 0. 02). Finally, the independent covariates that affected alpha 2 -macroglobulin clearance were age (P = 0. 03), diabetes (P = 0. 01) and the level of residual renal function (P< 0. 01). Serum albumin decreased with time on PD (P = 0. 02). A rise in small solute transport and a decrease in net ultrafiltration, but no change in protein clearances, were also observed after 2 years of PD. CONCLUSIONS: Transport properties across the PM, as evaluated by MTAC creatinine and sodium sieving determinations, are correlated with anthropometric characteristics (BSA) and by comorbid conditions (witnessed by the presence of diabetes, a low serum albumin concentration and the prescription of an ACE inhibitor). The short-term evolution (2 years) of the PM transport properties of patients on APD and icodextrin is still characterized by a progressive increase in small solute transport and a loss of ultrafiltration capacity, as documented in ancient studies, but not with a <b>modification</b> in protein <b>clearances.</b> This conclusion merits, however, to be further evaluated in a larger cohort of PD patients after a longer follow-up...|$|R
