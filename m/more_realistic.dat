5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} wanted {{a return to}} the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Although McCartney {{had hoped}} {{technology}} {{would allow the}} virtual band members to appear in hyper-realistic detail, Harmonix opted to start with more exaggerated, cartoon-like designs, gradually scaling them back to appear <b>more</b> <b>realistic.</b> Animation for the Beatles characters was aided by motion capture provided by Beatles tribute bands. Dhani Harrison also assisted with modeling for character animation in the game.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Manchester Mark 1 {{began in}} August 1948, {{with the initial}} aim of {{providing}} the university with a <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given {{a demonstration of the}} prototype, and was so impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.|$|E

5000|$|Portrait {{sculpture}} {{from the}} Republican era {{tends to be}} somewhat <b>more</b> modest, <b>realistic,</b> and natural compared to early Imperial works. A typical work might be one like the standing figure “A Roman Patrician with Busts of His Ancestors” (c. 30 B.C.) ...|$|R
5|$|Graphically, F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures a <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> appearance; {{the latter}} is used to {{give the appearance of}} depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. Volumetric lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E
5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> or primitive, despite {{her lack of}} knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life.|$|E
5|$|In January 1972, the State Committee for Cinematography {{requested}} editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These {{included a}} <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> film with a clearer {{image of the}} future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity.

5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> and practical.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce <b>more</b> <b>realistic,</b> dynamic {{interactions with the}} game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain additional snow or fog (which reacts to Batman moving through it); with PhysX disabled, the effects are lessened or absent.|$|E
5|$|Reconciling the {{continuity}} of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> level.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{style of}} manga called Bara, which is {{typically}} written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> themes than yaoi and {{is more likely to}} acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.|$|E
5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
50|$|Carlo Gozzi's play Turandot first {{appeared}} in 1762. It was originally written to be performed in the small theatre of San Samuele in Venice, and was deliberately written in the Commedia dell'arte style {{as a reaction to}} the <b>more</b> modern, <b>realistic</b> plays of Goldoni and others.|$|R
50|$|Another {{simplifying}} assumption {{was taken for}} granted In the treatment presented thus far; All models described a single polymer.

5|$|Andjar's toneels were {{generally}} based on day-to-day experiences, {{rather than the}} tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar's stage plays, {{as well as those}} of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works <b>more</b> <b>realistic.</b> However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals <b>more</b> <b>realistic.</b> The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E
