40|$|We {{investigate}} the star-formation in cometary tails of galaxies in clusters.

40|$|Abstract. Star {{formation}} {{efficiency in}} translucent <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds</b> {{has long been}} an unresolved and key issue in the field of low-mass star formation. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey for low-mass star formation in high-Galactic latitude <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds,</b> especially those of the translucent category, based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Nine new weak-line T Tauri star candidates have been discovered at high-Galactic latitudes, among which, 6 are seen against – thus possibly associated with – the translucent <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds,</b> MBM 16, MBM 19 and MBM 55. Further study on the Li-rich X-ray active sources is necessary to shed more light on star formation in translucent <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds...</b>|$|R

5|$|Part of the Milky Way's galactic plane {{passes through}} Serpens Cauda, which is {{therefore}} rich in galactic deep-sky objects, {{such as the}} Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the Pillars of Creation, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, {{one of the few}} objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud</b> and an H II region.|$|E
5|$|The Sun formed about 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{collapse}} of part of a giant <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud</b> that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology. The result {{is consistent with the}} radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 {{billion years ago}}. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud</b> and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was born.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{evolution}} of a local region of <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds,</b> moving in the mean gravitational potential of the Galactic disk. The clouds interact gravitationally with one another and undergo inelastic collisions. The clouds have been modeled as spheres, and a collision is assumed to take place when two clouds overlap. The outcome of a collision depends on the relative mass and velocity of the clouds and can result in the fragmentation or coalescence of the clouds. We find that the initial random mass distribution of the clouds evolves into a power-law distribution of the form N(m) oc m^α, where a = — 1. 7 to — 1. 9, and is flatter toward the low-mass end. The mean one-dimensional random velocity of the <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds</b> is ∼ 8 - 10 km s^- 1 and is found to be independent of cloud mass. These results agree well with the observed mass and velocity distribution of <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds.</b> We also conclude that cloud collisions in a sheared galactic disk, rather than local gravitional interactions, are important in determining the mass and random velocity distribution of <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds.</b> Cloud collisions thus play a dominant role in the formation of <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} (G2V) {{based on its}} {{spectral}} class. As such, it is informally {{referred to as a}} yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion, or 1,000,000,000. years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud.</b> Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud,</b> caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.|$|E

Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis <b>Molecular</b> <b>Cloud,</b> lying about 430 light years away.

5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from {{the collapse of}} a giant <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud</b> of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large <b>molecular</b> <b>cloud.</b> This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|E

40|$|Recent high {{resolution}} numerical simulations {{have shown that}} the interstellar atomic hydrogen clouds have a complex two-phase structure.

We complete our analysis by studying the relative importance of magnetic fields in the evolution of <b>molecular</b> <b>clouds</b> and their envelopes. We find that, although we recover magnetic field strengths comparable to the observed values, they appear unable to prevent clouds from collapsing but capable of maintaining the diffuse envelopes supported, while restricting the gas flows in the diffuse ISM along field lines (Chapter 6).
