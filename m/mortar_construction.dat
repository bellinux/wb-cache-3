50|$|The {{official}} reason {{cited by}} Nichiren Shōshū for demolishing {{the building is}} due to the metal rust discovered on the pillars within the shrine. Official reports were conducted by Kempon Hokke engineers who researched and validated the same ocean sand used for the <b>mortar</b> <b>construction</b> of the building, possibly risking the Dai Gohonzon's safety during an seismic earthquake. The report took one full year to complete and its results were submitted to High Priest Nikken for review. The school also concedes that its demolition of the Shōhondō was an extension of the doctrinal dispute between it and the Sōka Gakkai, emphasizing the impurity of the organisation for deviating from its formal doctrines of orthodoxy. Former Nichiren Shōshū High Priest, Nikken Shōnin replaced the Shōhondō with the traditional style building of Hōandō in 1998.|$|E

50|$|It {{was invented}} in 1794 by Joseph Aspdin and {{patented}} on 18 December 1824, {{largely as a result}} of efforts to develop stronger mortars. It was made popular during the late nineteenth century, and had by 1930 became more popular than lime <b>mortar</b> as <b>construction</b> material. The advantages of Portland cement is that it sets hard and quickly, allowing a faster pace of construction. Furthermore, fewer skilled workers are required in building a structure with Portland cement.|$|R

The analytical instruments used for this investigation were X- ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with EDX.

50|$|Dry {{stone and}} stones laid in mortar to build {{foundations}} {{are common in}} many parts of the world. Dry laid stone foundations may have been painted with <b>mortar</b> after <b>construction.</b> Sometimes the top, visible course of stone is hewn, quarried stones. Besides using mortar, stones can also be put in a gabion. One disadvantage is that if using regular steel rebars, the gabion would last much less long than when using mortar (due to rusting). Using weathering steel rebars could reduce this disadvantage somewhat.|$|R

50|$|Silicon as silica in {{the form}} of rock crystal was {{familiar}} to the predynastic Egyptians, who used it for beads and small vases; to the early Chinese; and probably to many others of the ancients. The manufacture of glass containing silica was carried out both by the Egyptians — at least as early as 1500 BCE — and by the Phoenicians. Many of the naturally occurring compounds or silicate minerals were used in various kinds of <b>mortar</b> for <b>construction</b> of dwellings by the earliest people.|$|R

40|$|The {{classification}} {{the types}} of arcs and domes in the Iranian buildings are very diverse {{in terms of its}} geometry and efficiency. According to the primary definition, arc and domes are a kind of ancient static system which has contributed considerable by helping Iranian architects in order to widen and coverage openings. Regardless of the geometric shape, factors such as the type of materials, <b>mortar,</b> <b>construction</b> technique and the position of placement are effective in the process of arch implementation. The persistence of these structures indicates high skill and experience of architects and the witness of this claim are remaining arc and dome in ancient Iranian buildings that so far has not broken under natural and human conditions. In this study, we examine the arcs by identifying and finding out how their implementing is practiced in most historical buildings, due to the resistance and static of these buildings. In order to analyze and study, the present study method used executive methods to identify and introducing examples of executive techniques in historical buildings of Iran and experimental methods of architects, as well as books, and articles related to the topic. It can be said that the gathering and procedures for implementation and compilation techniques, the executive practices of these buildings are the inspiration of Iranian expert architects for more generations and will be a good pattern for learning for those interested in this field. Also, the executive procedures could be solution for the problems of restored historic buildings...|$|E
50|$|Mursmäcka, {{also called}} bruksmäcka or only smäcka, was an {{historical}} profession {{for women in}} Sweden. A mursmäcka was a female construction worker with the task to hand <b>mortar</b> during <b>construction</b> work. The profession is recorded from at least 1691 (though it is not confirmed by name until the 1830s) and discontinued in 1922. This was a very hard but common work for a poor uneducated women during the 19th century, particularly in Stockholm. In July 1888, the Mursmäcka of Stockholm performed a great strike action which attracted considerable attention in contemporary Sweden.|$|R
