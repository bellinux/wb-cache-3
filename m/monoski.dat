5|$|Britain entered three skiers, {{two men and}} one woman, {{into the}} Games. Russell Docker, {{one of only two}} athletes to have competed for Britain at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, {{appeared}} in his second Games, this time in sitting events having switched to the use of a <b>monoski.</b> Sean Rose, also a sit-skier, and Liz Miller, a standing skier who uses a prosthetic leg, were the other British participants. The three athletes were members of the British Adaptive Ski Team, which is run by national ski charity Disability Snowsport UK. Each of the three skiers raced in four events in their respective categories; downhill, giant slalom, slalom and Super-G. Rose had the highest finish of the three; he placed sixth in the men's sitting downhill, 0.7 seconds outside of the medal positions. Russell Docker crashed in the same event and did not finish. Docker also failed to finish in the slalom, as did Rose in the giant slalom. Miller completed the course in each of her events with a best finish of tenth in the downhill.|$|E
2500|$|As {{alpine ski}} {{technology}} has advanced, so has <b>monoski</b> technology. [...] In North America in the 1970s and early 1980s, early [...] "sit-skis" [...] {{took the form}} of fiberglass sleds with metal runners. The first downhill sit-ski in the US, the Arroya, was invented by American Peter Axelson in 1978. Dragging very long poles or [...] "slicks" [...] in the snow were the method in which turns were actually made harder, although not effectively. [...] Few users became proficient enough to descend even intermediate terrain without assistance from a [...] "tetherer." [...] By the early '80s, Europeans were experimenting with [...] "ski-bobs" [...] that mounted on two small skis. [...] In place of today's minimal bucket seats were large fiberglass or Kevlar shells, and leaf springs at first were used instead of slide absorbers. The three-ski design proved accident prone, and it was soon abandoned for a single ski by most manufacturers. [...] By the middle of the decade, the technology had migrated to Canada, and on both continents the modern <b>monoski</b> began to emerge. [...] In the United States, Enabling Technologies' Unique, Sunrise Medical's Shadow, and Dan Fallon's Fallonski were some of the first commercially available monoskis. Praschberger (Austria), Tessier (France), and DynAccess (USA) are some of the major companies.|$|E
2500|$|In para-Alpine skiing, {{the skier}} uses a <b>monoski,</b> which is {{required}} to have breaks {{on both sides of}} the ski. The chair can detach from a ski. Helmets are required in LW10 para-Alpine competition; Slalom helmets for Slalom and crash helmets for the Giant Slalom. The para-Nordic sit-ski configuration has two skis. LW10 para-Nordic sit-skiers can use a sit-ski with outrigger skis, which are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. They sometimes use a quadriplegic ski, called a [...] "Swing-Bo", which was designed to give the skier better steering, and rely less on outriggers. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
5000|$|... == Benefits == <b>Monoskiing</b> has {{benefits}} for participants. If a previous skier badly injures {{themselves from the}} waist down, most would quit skiing; but with <b>monoskiing</b> the lower body can work as one unit.|$|R
50|$|Recently the {{popularity}} of <b>monoskiing</b> has increased, particularly in France and in the United States largely due to technological advances {{in the design of}} the ski. As with alpine skis the carved shape of the ski has meant easier turns and as a result skiers and even snowboarders are finding the transition to <b>monoskis</b> less daunting.|$|R
5000|$|Fans of <b>monoskiing</b> arrange festivals {{during the}} season to try out new skis and compete in various competitions.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>monoski,</b> {{also known}} as a sit-ski, {{consists}} of a molded seat mounted on a metal frame. A shock absorber beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski-snow contact. Modern monoskis interface with a single, ordinary alpine ski by means of a [...] "ski foot," [...] a metal or plastic block {{in the shape of a}} boot sole that clicks into the ski's binding. A monoskier uses outriggers for stability; an outrigger resembles a forearm crutch with a short ski on the bottom. People new to mono-skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski; advanced monoskiers can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing moguls, terrain parks, race courses, glades and even backcountry terrain—in short, wherever stand-up skiers can go.|$|E

2500|$|Sit skiers {{generally}} {{follow the}} same rules as sighted skiers laid out by the International Ski Federation. They use a mono-ski, which has a specially fitted chair attached to the single ski. [...] The skiers also use outrigrer poles to aid in balance. The <b>monoskis</b> are sometimes called tubs or buckets. Wheelchair users are classified as sit-skiers.|$|R

2500|$|Snowboards are boards {{where both}} feet are secured {{to the same}} board, which are wider than skis, {{with the ability to}} glide on snow. Snowboards widths are between 6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters. Snowboards are {{differentiated}} from <b>monoskis</b> by the stance of the user. [...] In <b>monoskiing,</b> the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. [...] Users of such equipment may be referred to as snowboarders. Commercial snowboards generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder, who generally rides in an upright position. These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure, entertainment, and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding.|$|R
50|$|Dreaming in Mono {{combines}} a 56-minute-long drama (divided into 7x8 minute episodes) with character interviews by the fictional documentary filmmaker Yasmine, history of <b>monoskiing</b> backstories, character songs and videos, website, character Myspace and Facebook pages, character Twitter feeds. The {{aim of the}} initiative was to connect via non-traditional and social media with an audience difficult to reach through conventional marketing tactics and messages.|$|R
50|$|The ski centre {{also offers}} tandemskis and dualskis, for {{disabled}} skiers. The tandemski {{is similar to}} a wheelchair on skis, and requires an accompanier behind to help with the skiing. The dualski is a type of sitski similar to <b>monoskis</b> used in paralympic competition, and is controlled using guidepoles (ski poles with skis attached to their bottoms instead of picks).|$|R
50|$|Bramble {{has made}} a {{reputation}} for himself {{not only as a}} racer but also as a freeskier. One of the first people to take a <b>monoski</b> into terrain parks, halfpipes, and extreme terrain, Bramble and teammate Monte Meier are featured in Warren Miller's 2006 ski movie Off the Grid.|$|E
50|$|Monoskiing {{was invented}} in the late 1950s by Dennis Phillips at Hyak, Washington using a single water ski and bear trap bindings. Surfer Mike Doyle {{promoted}} the <b>monoski</b> in the early 1970s, after which monoskiing's relative popularity slowly increased, but the interest eventually waned in favor of snowboarding.|$|E
50|$|A <b>monoski</b> is {{a single}} wide ski used for skiing on snow. The same boots, bindings, and poles are used as in alpine skiing. Unlike in snowboarding, both feet face forward, rather than {{sideways}} to the direction of travel. Similar equipment includes the skwal and the teleboard, with feet in tandem formation (one ahead of the other).|$|E
5|$|Soyer is an LW11 {{classified}} skier, who skied {{before his}} accident. He took up sit-skiing while rehabilitating from his injuries, {{and was able}} to adapt to a mono-ski within the first day of trying it at a Disability Wintersport Australia camp at Falls Creek. Before the year was out following that camp, he went to Colorado and participated in a skiing camp specifically for people who use <b>monoskis.</b> During the following Australian ski season, he participated in a learn to ski race camp at Thredbo.|$|R

50|$|The Snurfer was the {{predecessor}} of the snowboard. It was a <b>monoski,</b> ridden like a snowboard, {{but like a}} skateboard or surfboard, it had no binding. According to the 1966 patent by inventor Sherman Poppen, it was wider and shorter than a pair of skis, with an anti-skid foot rest. Like a sled, it had a lanyard attached to the front.|$|E
50|$|Matthew Stockford is a British former Paralympic skier who won {{medals at}} the 1992 Winter Paralympics and 1994 Winter Paralympics. Stockford broke {{his back in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1985.

50|$|Ski {{design has}} evolved {{enormously}} since {{the beginnings of}} the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, side cut, and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s side cut became more pronounced {{to make it easier to}} carve turns. Alpine skis typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including twin-tip skis for freestyle skiing, alpine touring ski, and <b>monoski.</b>|$|E

50|$|In June 2009 three snowboarders from Bærum, Mikkel Bang among them, {{released}} a music video mocking the celebrity image of Petter Pilgaard. The video {{which was published}} on the Norwegian snowboarding website tacky.no features some fairly scornful characterizatons of Pilgaard who commented that he had previously {{been associated with the}} <b>monoski</b> community in Bærum. The one-time performers and producers of the video stated to the media that they were offered to make the video for free and that there were no ill feelings behind the video.

50|$|Dreaming in Mono is {{a fictional}} drama {{revolving}} around McDonald's customer and former professional alpine skier Alain Duchamp and his archrival Hansi Von Spitzmark. The two rivals regularly competed {{against each other}} in the 1970s with fundamentally different styles and philosophies concerning their approach to life and to their sport. In one particular race Alain attempted to race against Hansi by using his revolutionary new <b>monoski.</b> Hansi quickly reported Alain to the relevant ski governing body and Alain was disqualified and never raced again. Hansi, meanwhile, won gold after gold medal and became an international celebrity.|$|E
5000|$|A skwal is {{the main}} piece of {{equipment}} used for skwalling, a hybrid sport combining the carving of skiing and riding feel of snowboarding. It {{is similar to a}} snowboard or <b>monoski</b> in that both feet are attached to the same board. On a skwal the feet are one in front of the other, in line with the direction the skwal is pointing in. This differs from snowboards (in which the feet are side-on to the direction of the board) and monoskis (in which the feet point {{in the direction of the}} board, but are side-by-side).|$|E
50|$|Bramble {{grew up in}} New Jersey {{and began}} skiing recreationally in Pennsylvania's Poconos at age 11. By 1994, he was a serious snowboarder and {{occasional}} skier living in the Lake Tahoe area when he became paralyzed in a snowboarding accident. He soon taught himself to <b>monoski</b> and moved to Winter Park, Colorado, where he joined the Winter Park Disabled Ski Team. He returned to the Tahoe area soon after, settling in Truckee, California, but having acquired the racing skills that he needed. He {{was named to the}} U.S. Disabled Ski Team in 1998 after winning the super G at that year's U.S. Disabled Alpine Championships.|$|E
50|$|His parents didn't coddle him; as {{a toddler}} he wasn't treated any {{differently}} than his sisters, Meagan and Shannon, and grew up floating rivers and climbing mountains. His parents enrolled him in gymnastics, and wrestling, which gave him the agility and upper body strength to flip himself onto counters and do handstands. At the age of 10, he started skiing, with a custom designed <b>monoski.</b> He was good enough at skiing to win a silver medal at the X Games extreme sports competition.He travels mostly by propelling himself with his arms on his skateboard, rarely using his wheelchair, and not using a pair of prosthetic legs since age 12.|$|E
