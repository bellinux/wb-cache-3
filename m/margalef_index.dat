40|$|The {{present study}} {{takes place in}} the {{fountain}} of “Can Verdaguer” and its associated canal. The area appears inside the municipality of “Sant Gregori”. Geologically, the fountain is located NE of the “Depressió de la Selva”, just on its limit with the “Serralada Transversal”. The main objectives of this project are: 1) to know the geological origin of the water; 2) investigate the evolution of the algae biota along the canal, while the hydrochemical properties of the water change through its path and 3) to study in detail the water chemistry. In order to accomplish these objectives, the following actions have been completed: 1) collect the existent information about the geology of the zone; 2) the development of a geophysical campaign (electrical resistivity tomography); 3) water analysis (pH, dissolved oxigen, water flow, redox potential, temperature, Cl-, Br-, SO 42 -, F-, Na+, NH 4 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -, total P, total As, total B, total Fe, total Mn, total Rb and total Sr) along 11 sampling points and 4) the study of the algae biota present in the canal sediment by measuring some biological variables (<b>Margalef</b> <b>Index,</b> chlorophyll, biovolume, diatom density per cm 2 and weight). Taking into account the previous projects present on the scientific background of this fountain and the ERT profiles, it can be advocated that the deep origin of the water in the “Can Verdaguer” fountain is related to the water infiltration inside the fault of “Llorà” through the “Serralada Transversal”. According to the hydrochemical point of view, the water of “Can Verdaguer” can be classified as sodium bicarbonate. In addition, it presents a slightly acidic pH, with high concentration of dissolved iron, calcium, sodium and bicarbonates. These chemical parameters are the ones that define, in a more representatively way, the chemical properties of this water system.

40|$|A {{survey of}} macro {{invertebrate}} fauna of Anambra River {{was carried out}} for 22 months at Otuocha, Ogurugu and Nsugbe. The macro invertebrates were sampled using kick sampling techniques and scoop nets. Sampled specimens were identified to generic level. During the study a total of 21 genera of macroinvertebrates belonging to 13 families were identified. The fauna was composed of Gyrinus sp. (29. 2 %), Macrobranchium sp. (19. 6 %), Ranatra sp. (13. 2 %) and Agabus sp. (3. 5 %). The <b>margalef’s</b> <b>index</b> of fauna richness showed that Otuocha station had the highest species richness (12. 70), followed by Nsugbe (7. 01), and Ogurugu (6. 80) stations. The least fauna diversity of 0. 21 was registered at Nsugbe as against 3. 15 at Otuocha and 0. 86 at Ogurugu. The Mc Naughton community dominance index was more pronounced at Nsugbe (53. 1) than at Otuocha (49. 69) and Ogurugu (47. 04).

40|$|Abstract: Chlorophyll distribution, {{phytoplankton}} biomass and pigment diversity {{were investigated}} at fortnightly intervals, in eight fish ponds located in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Except for stations 6 and 7, the diatoms {{were the most}} prominent phytoplankton group while the chlo-rophyceae were less prominent. Peak periods of chlorophyll-a coincided with peak periods of nutrient availability and generally, the stations recorded high algal biomass. <b>Margalef</b> <b>Index</b> (M. I.) ratios were negatively correlated with both gross and net production while the latter were positively correlated with chlorophyll-a but negatively correlated with chlorophylls b and c. In terms of phytoplankton diversity, station 7 recorded the least number of species while the maximum number was recorded in station 4. Resumen: Se investigó la distribución de la clorofila, biomasa del fitoplancton y diversi-dad de pigmentos en intervalos catorcenales, en ocho estanques de peces localizados en Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Excepto para las estaciones 6 y 7, las diatomeas fueron el grupo de fitoplancton más importante mientras que el menos prominente fue el de las clorofilaceae. De los perío-dos con picos de clorofila, uno coincidió con el de disponibilidad de nutrientes y, en general, las estaciones registraron una alta biomasa algal. Las tasas del Índice de Margalef (M.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} the abundance of rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) was conducted from 15 to 28 June, 2008 at the dipterocarp forest of Lanjak Entimau, Sarawak, Malaysia. Collections were made at five sites namely Kawi River, Menyaring II, Satap, Begua and Joh River. A total of 175 rove beetles comprising of 17 species were sampled from all 5 sites of Lanjak Entimau. There was a high abundance (<b>Margalef</b> <b>index,</b> 3. 097) and moderate diversity (Simpson diversity index, 0. 798) of rove beetles at Lanjak Entimau. Four species were identified to species level, Orphnebius bakerianus Motschulscky, 1858, Eleusis kraatzi LeConte, 1863, Belonuchus quadratu Nordman, 1837, Bledius gracilicornis Casey, 1889. Seven species were identified to genus level Orphnebius sp., Coproporus sp., Paederus sp 1, Paederus sp 2, Hesperus sp., Lispinus sp., Bledius sp. and six species could not be identified even to genus level. Six unidentified species probably new for Science. Moderate diversity and high abundance of rove beetles at Lanjak Entimau are due to diverse habitats. Some differences in species sampled from peninsular Malaysia is {{explained in terms of}} isolation between Sarawak in Borneo island with peninsular Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{present study is}} to select high performance metrics for developing a multimetrics biotic index to assess headwater stream conditions of the Chi and Mun basins in northeastern Thailand (Khorat Platau (Mekong) ecoregion) by using benthic macroinvertebrates based on rapid bioassessment protocols (RBPs). Multimetric biotic indices were developed by two methods (decrease and continuous methods). Nine statistically valid metrics were selected from 24 candidate metrics. These nine metrics represent taxa richness, community composition, tolerance/intolerance, functional feeding and habit measure and include the number of total taxa, number of EPTC taxa, <b>Margalef</b> <b>index,</b> Beck’s biotic index, Simpson’s index, percent intolerance, number of filterer's taxa, number of scraper taxa, {{and the number of}} clinger taxa. The results of the biotic index performance demonstrate that the DRQ 1 index score (decrease method) produced slightly higher correlation with total habitat score (r = 0. 82, p < 0. 001) than did the CAU index score (continuous method, r = 0. 81, p < 0. 001). A narrative assessment analysis is recommended when using a multimentric index approach and appears to provide a useful assessment of stream conditions in the Chi and Mun basins...|$|E
