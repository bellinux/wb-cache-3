5|$|The first {{automatic}} power {{windows were}} developed by Packard in 1940. Each of the major American brands experimented with the technology, which was initially for luxury vehicles {{as a replacement for}} <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> roll up windows. In the 1950s, these became widespread in American passenger cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} no signals or {{automatic}} points {{to control the}} switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a level crossing the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> the points.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were <b>manually</b> <b>operated,</b> and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E

5|$|It {{was first}} thought that Fossett {{may have also}} been wearing a Breitling Emergency watch with a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> ELT that had a range of up to , but no signal was {{received}} from it. On September 13, Fossett's wife, Peggy, issued a statement clarifying that he owned such a watch but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight.|$|E
5|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency {{even if he was}} away from his home and surgery. The manual exchange served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{also carried}} twelve 8.8cm (3.45in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns, also mounted in casemates. These guns were {{supplied}} with between 170 and 250 shells per gun. These guns fired 13.8kg (30.4lb) at a muzzle velocity of 590m/s (1,936ft/s). Their {{rate of fire}} was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to 10,500m (11,480yd). The gun mounts were <b>manually</b> <b>operated.</b> The ships' gun armament was rounded out by twelve machine guns.|$|E
5000|$|The film I, Robot (2004), set in Chicago in 2035, {{features}} autonomous vehicles {{driving on}} highways, allowing {{the car to}} travel safer at higher speeds than if manually controlled. The option to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the vehicles is available.|$|R
50|$|The game's {{autopilot}} {{system can}} be used {{most of the time}} to eliminate the tedium of travel. However it is completely possible (and in some situations, necessary) to choose one's own capsule jump destination or to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the LDS drive.|$|R
30|$|For each {{component}} of the stress meter, a mechanism capable of mechanical zero adjustment is installed as necessary. This mechanism adjusts by <b>manually</b> <b>operating</b> a built-in motor, {{and it can be}} used to reset the meter in case of a large secular variation.|$|R
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, {{ropes and}} firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks. There are maps and other {{illustrations}} of historical times, including a plaque that depicts the winds and the currents in Muscat bay. One room, with a ceiling made from palm-logs, is filled with cultural relics of Oman. The square central tower holds the main museum exhibits including rugs, pottery, jewelry, weapons, household utensils and incense holders. A dining hall overlooks the courtyard {{for use by the}} distinguished visitors. An old breeze-maker has been preserved in this room, once <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> but now mechanized.|$|E
5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been <b>manually</b> <b>operated.</b> The current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance. Metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E
5000|$|Temporary files may be deleted <b>manually.</b> <b>Operating</b> {{systems may}} clear out the {{temporary}} directory on a reboot, {{and they may}} have [...] "cleaner" [...] scripts that remove files if they have not been accessed in a certain amount of time. Also, memory-based systems, such as tmpfs, inherently do not preserve files across a reboot.|$|R
50|$|Clayton Bridge {{railway station}} on the line between Manchester and Stalybridge opened in April 1846 and became {{a victim of the}} Beeching Axe, closing in 1968. The station {{buildings}} were to the west of Berry Brow, the signal box was on the opposite side on the north of the line and was also used to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the level crossing gates. Nothing remains of the station.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{time went}} on, many railroads came to see {{automatic}} block signaling as cost effective, since it reduced the need for employees to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> each signal, reduced the repair costs and damage claims resulting from collisions, made possible a more efficient flow of trains, {{reduced the number of}} hours trains and crews sat idle, and decreased overall transit times from point to point.|$|R
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were <b>manually</b> <b>operated.</b> They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 {{radial engine}} was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets {{in the rear of}} the engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E
50|$|The signal box, {{situated}} on the northern side of the line, just east of Berry Brow, was also used to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the level crossing gates. It was fitted with a larger 22 lever LYR frame in 1893. Remotely operated automatic lifting barriers, monitored by CCTV, were installed at the road crossing in 1973 and this resulted in closure of the signal box on 16 December 1973.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{telescopic}} sights with variable magnification. The magnification can be varied by <b>manually</b> <b>operating</b> a zoom mechanism. Variable sights offer more flexibility regarding shooting at varying ranges, targets and light conditions {{and offer a}} relative wide field of view at lower magnification settings. The syntax for variable sights is the following: minimal magnification - maximum magnification × objective lens, for example, 3-9×40.|$|R
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> a train when necessary.|$|R
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> breechblock. The tank {{commander}} {{doubled as}} loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|The target, 17 by 17cm (6.7 by 6.7 in), is {{traditionally}} made of light-coloured cardboard upon which scoring lines, {{and a black}} aiming mark consisting of the score zones 7 through 10, are printed. There is also an inner ten ring, {{but the number of}} inner tens is only used for tie-breaking. The changing of these traditional targets is handled by each shooter, by means of electronic – or more archaically, <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> – carrier devices. In major competitions, only one shot may be fired on each target, a number that can increase to two, five or even ten with lowering level and importance of the competition. Used targets are collected by range officials to be scored in a separate office.|$|E
5|$|Their {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{consisted of}} fourteen 10.5cm C/33 L/65 guns, sixteen 3.7cm L/83 guns, and between ten and twenty 2cm guns. The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 rounds per minute, and had an effective ceiling of 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective ceiling of 6,800m (22,310ft), though tracers were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft). They had a rate of fire of 30rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|A brakeman's cabin (also brakeman's cab) or brakeman's caboose (US) {{was a small}} one-man {{compartment}} {{at one end of}} {{a railway}} wagon to provide shelter for the brakeman from the weather and in which equipment for <b>manually</b> <b>operating</b> the wagon brake was located. They were built in the days before continuous braking was available and the locomotive brake needed to be augmented by brakemen applying the wagon brakes individually.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, young William {{engaged in}} labor {{organizing}} {{for the first}} time when he attempted to launch a union for the boys who worked as trappers, <b>manually</b> <b>operating</b> the ventilation of the mines. When the fledgling union threatened a strike over a wage reduction, union representative Wilson discovered the limits of union solidarity in the face of superior force, when he was thrown over a foreman's knee and paddled. The incipient strike was broken.|$|R

5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of May 3, 2017, Downtown Line (DTL) train {{services}} towards Chinatown were disrupted for 7 hours due to a platform screen door (PSD) malfunction at Botanic Gardens MRT. This, as stated by SBS Transit, the line's operator, was due to a signalling-related fault. This resulted in the doors being unable to open automatically, which meant that staff had to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> them whenever a train arrived at the station, which took some time and thus caused delays in train services.|$|R
5000|$|The {{control unit}} is the {{processing}} unit which decides {{how to react}} with the incoming signals get a desired land level. It adjusts {{the height of the}} scraper by activating or deactivating the electro-hydraulic actuators (solenoid valves). Generally these are ON OFF type solenoid valves but some modern systems use proportional valves [...] On the dash board of control unit there are some keys and indicators are provided as user interface through which user can monitor the operation or <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the machine when needed.|$|R
40|$|More {{refinement}} {{was added}} to the five sample ports that were installed along the cold model riser. Each sample port is now equipped with an electrically actuated X ball-valve that can be operated from a switch in the main control panel area. These actuated ball valves control the on/off position of the sample port. They are switched on for a desired period of time for sample collection during a test run. They are particularly useful for the hard-to-reach sampling locations {{near the top of the}} riser where <b>manually</b> <b>operating</b> a ball-valve could be difficult...|$|R
