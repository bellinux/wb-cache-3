The publication was a hand-written news sheet that was reproduced by a Cyclostyle, or early stenograph, process. Fairbridge had no ink and so had to make it himself. He also had to source paper for each edition as he had brought no supply of his own. He supported the venture by readers' subscriptions which could {{take the form of a}} pot of <b>marmalade,</b> a <b>box</b> of candles or an old spade.|$|R
