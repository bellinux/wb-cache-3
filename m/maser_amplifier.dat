For {{many of these}} applications {{it is necessary to}} have control over single emitters with long spin coherence times. Such single quantum systems have been realized using quantum dots, colour centres in diamond, dopants in nanostructures and molecules.

40|$|Experiments have {{investigated}} the production of ultra-short electromagnetic pulses and their interaction with electrons in various resonant structures. Diagnostic systems used in the measurements included large bandwidth detection systems for capturing the short pulses. Deconvolution techniques have been applied to account for bandwidth limitation of the detection systems and to extract the actual pulse amplitudes and durations from the data. A Martin-Puplett interferometer has been constructed {{for use as a}} Fourier transform spectrometer. The growth of superradiant electromagnetic spikes from short duration (0. 5 - 1. 0 ns), high current (0. 6 - 2. 0 kA) electron pulses has been investigated in a Ka-band Cherenkov maser and Ka- and W-band backward wave oscillators (BWO). In the Cherenkov maser, radiation spikes were produced with a peak power #=# 70 ps and a bandwidth #<=# 19 %. It is shown that coherent spontaneous emission from {{the leading edge of the}} electron pulse drives these interactions, giving rise to self-amplified coherent spontaneous emission (SACSE). BWO spikes were produced with a peak power #<=# 63 MW and a pulse duration #approx# 250 ps in the Ka-band and #<=# 12 MW and #approx# 170 ps in the W-band. Evidence of superradiant evolution has been observed in the measurements of scaling laws such as power scaling with the current squared and duration scaling inversely with the fourth root of the power. An X-band free-electron <b>maser</b> <b>amplifier,</b> in which a short (1. 0 ns) injected radiation pulse interacts with a long (#approx# 140 ns) electron beam, has been investigated.

The use of a beam trajectory modeling code has enabled optimisation of the beam transport system, with results showing a laminar beam profile and transverse velocity spread imparted via beam transport reduced to ∼ 3 %.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{operation}} regime of a hybrid planar free-electron <b>maser</b> (FEM) <b>amplifier</b> near the magnetoresonant {{value of the}} uniform longitudinal (guide) magnetic field. Using analytical expressions for individual test electron trajectories and normal frequencies of their three-dimensional oscillations in the magnetostatic field of the hybrid planar FEM, an analytical condition of chaotization of motion is established and shown to be given by the Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion applied to the normal undulator and cyclotron frequencies {{with respect to the}} coupling induced by the undulator magnetic field. It is also shown analytically that, in spite of the well-known drop for the exact magnetoresonance, the gain attains its maximal value in the zone of regular dynamics slightly above the magnetoresonant value of the guide magnetic field. Under the condition of undulator resonance, it is practically independent of the amplitude of the undulator magnetic field and the wavelength of amplified signal. To account for space-charge effects, we propose a theoretical model of a weakly relativistic FEM, which accommodates not only potential but also rotational parts of the nonradiated electromagnetic field of a moving charged particle. It turns out that the rotational part of nonradiated field diminishes the defocusing influence of the potential part on the beam bunching. Numeric simulation of the nonlinear stage of amplification is fulfilled, taking into consideration adiabatic entrance of the electron beam to the interaction region and initial electron velocity spread. We find that nonradiated field and initial electron velocity spread do not influence essentially the efficiency of hybrid planar FEM amplification if parameters of the beam-microwave interaction correspond to the operational regime in the zone of regular dynamics near the magnetoresonance...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the {{increase}} in received telemetry signal power required {{to compensate for the}} use of a radio frequency interference (RFI) filter in front of the DSN receiving system low-noise amplifier is described. The telemetry system for which the degradation is calculated is an uncoded PCM/PM system in which the NRZ data directly modulates the carrier at a modulation level which leaves a discrete carrier. A phase-locked loop in the RF receiver tracks the discrete carrier and coherently demodulates the PCM data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 An {{evaluation}} of the meteorological usefulness of a <b>maser</b> RF <b>amplifier</b> on an AN/MPS- 34 X-band weather radar indicates that there are both advantages and disadvantages to its use. The {{problems associated with the}} maser used in this study included tuning problems, loss of gain through loss of liquid helium and from tilting too high, and instability of the gain of the maser with time. The problems encountered which are potentially common to all masers included logistics problems, loss of gain because of saturation of the maser, and sufficient additional sensitivity to the radar receiver system to allow the detection of thermal noise. The detection of thermal noise, predicted by theory for the system used, is the most significant result of the study. Objects at a temperature of 300 K radiate thermal noise which is easily detected by the maser-equipped AN/MPS- 34 while on short pulse (MDS ≤ - 100 dbm while the noise power for the MPS- 34 on short pulse from objects at 300 K exceeds - 108 dbm). The advantages of the maser for the detection of clouds, precipitation, fog, clear air turbulence, insects, and birds are investigated. Little advantage is gained by using the maser on sensitive radars for most forms of precipitation except light snow. For sensitive radars, there are definite advantages to using the maser for clouds and bird detection and to some extent for insect detection. An additional 12 db of gain doubles the maximum range of detection for point targets and increases the maximum range of detection for distributed targets four times. Fog and clear air turbulence both have such small reflectivities that the maser did not provide enough additional gain to make detection of these feasible. Several uses of a maser for weather radar are suggested including the study of first echoes and clouds. The addition of a maser to other wavelength radars and to radars of relatively low sensitivity are also considered...|$|R
