Individuals in different wings in the same retirement home have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment, though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health. Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> for the relationship between social support and perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relevance of social-influence-related <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> in the genesis of adolescent smoking. In the present study, the interactive effects of <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> with social influence (peer smoking and peer approval) on adolescent smoking were examined in a sample of high school students. Potential <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> of the effects of social influence were self-efficacy judgments, self-esteem, perceived stress, parental supervision after school, and gender. Results demonstrated that self-efficacy judgments signficantly moderated the predictive effects of social influence on smoking tendencies. These findings are consistent with theories suggesting that certain personality or situational variables act as buffers that either protect the adolescent against social influence or make the adolescent more susceptible to such influence...|$|R

50|$|Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005) {{provided}} additional {{clarity and}} definition of moderated mediation. The following regression equations are fundamental to their model of moderated mediation, where A = independent variable, C = outcome variable, B = mediator variable, and D = <b>moderator</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the three manners proposed by Muller and colleagues in which moderated mediation can occur, Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007) proposed that the independent variable A itself can moderate {{the effect of the}} mediator B on the outcome variable C. They also proposed that a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> D could moderate the effect of A on B, while a different moderator E moderates the effect of B on C.|$|E
5000|$|In statistics, {{moderation}} and mediation {{can occur}} {{together in the}} same model. [...] Moderated mediation, also known as conditional indirect effects, occurs when the treatment effect of an independent variable A on an outcome variable C via a mediator variable B differs depending on levels of a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> D. Specifically, either the effect of A on the B, and/or the effect of B on C depends on the level of D.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} mediated moderation, one must first establish moderation, meaning that the direction and/or {{the strength of the}} relationship between the independent and dependent variables (path C) differs depending on the level of a third variable (the <b>moderator</b> <b>variable).</b> Researchers next look for the presence of mediated moderation when they have a theoretical reason to believe that there is a fourth variable that acts as the mechanism or process that causes the relationship between the independent variable and the moderator (path A) or between the moderator and the dependent variable (path C).|$|E
50|$|Mediated {{moderation}} is {{a variant}} of both moderation and mediation. This is where there is initially overall moderation and the direct effect of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> on the outcome is mediated. The main difference between mediated moderation and moderated mediation {{is that for the}} former there is initial (overall) moderation and this effect is mediated and for the latter there is no moderation but the effect of either the treatment on the mediator (path A) is moderated or the effect of the mediator on the outcome (path B) is moderated.|$|E
50|$|Very often RA {{is used as}} a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> to look at {{differences}} between studies.

50|$|As {{demonstrated}} by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which moderate substance abuse or dependence. In these examples, the <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> impacts the level to which {{the strength of the}} relationship varies between a given predictor variable and the outcome of substance abuse or dependence. For example, there is a significant relationship between psychobehavioral risk factors, such as tolerance of deviance, rebelliousness, achievement, perceived drug risk, familism, family church attendance and other factors, and substance abuse and dependence. That relationship is moderated by familism which means that the strength of the relationship is increased or decreased based on the level of familism present in a given individual.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Research on the {{relationship}} between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty has advanced to a stage that requires a more thorough examination of <b>moderator</b> <b>variables.</b> Limited research shows how moderators influence {{the relationship}} between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in a service context; this article aims to present empirical evidence of the conditions in which the satisfaction-loyalty relationship becomes stronger or weaker. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of more than 700 customers of DIY retailers and multi-group structural equation modelling, the authors examine moderating effects of several firm-related variables, variables that result from firm/employee-customer interactions and individual-level variables (i. e. loyalty cards, critical incidents, customer age, gender, income, expertise). Findings – The empirical results suggest that not all of the moderators considered influence the satisfaction-loyalty link. Specifically, critical incidents and income are important moderators of the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Practical implications – Several of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> considered in this study are manageable variables. Originality/value – This study should prove valuable to academic researchers as well as service and retailing managers. It systematically analyses the moderating effect of firm-related and individual-level variables {{on the relationship}} between customer satisfaction and loyalty. It shows the differential effect of different types of <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> on the satisfaction-loyalty link...|$|R

5000|$|When two {{variables}} are related, or correlated, {{one can make}} predictions for these {{two variables}}. [...] However, {{it is important to}} note that this does not mean causality. At this point, it is not possible to determine a causal relationship between the two variables; correlation does not imply causality. However, correlation evidence is significant because it can help identify potential causes of behavior. Path analysis is a statistical technique that can be used with correlational data. This involves the identification of mediator and moderator variables. A mediator variable is used to explain the correlation between two variables. A <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> affects the direction or strength of the correlation between two variables. A spurious relationship is a relationship in which the relation between two variables can be explained by a third variable.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistics}} and regression analysis, moderation {{occurs when the}} relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The third variable {{is referred to as}} the <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> or simply the moderator. The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a categorical (e.g., sex, ethnicity, class) or quantitative (e.g., level of reward) variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between dependent and independent variables. Specifically within a correlational analysis framework, a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.|$|E
50|$|Facebook {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{increased}} divorce and/ or break-up rates. Couples so inclined tend to express feelings of jealousy when their partners comment on a person of the opposite gender's wall. To cope with the uncertainty of a suspected romantic relationship, partner surveillance on Facebook is becoming more popular. However, skepticism between couples may inevitably cause the end of relationship. Russell B. Clayton, Alexander Nagurney and Jessica R. Smith, surveyed 205 Facebook users aged 18-82 to determine if frequent Facebook use predicated negative relationship outcomes. Furthermore, the researchers examined length of relationship as a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> in the aforementioned model. The results indicate that a high level of Facebook usage is associated with negative relationship outcomes, and that these relationships are indeed mediated by Facebook-related conflict. This series of relationships only holds for those who are, or have been, in relatively newer relationships of 3 years or less. The current study adds to the growing body of literature investigating Internet use and relationship outcomes, and may be a precursor to further research investigating whether Facebook use attributes to the divorce rate, emotional cheating, and physical cheating.|$|E

40|$|Background: Atypical visual {{processing}} in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), such as superior processing of local details or substandard processing of global structures, {{has been investigated}} repeatedly, but research findings vary widely and are often contradictory. In spite of influential theories like the Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) account {{and a great deal}} of research inspired by them, the atypical {{visual processing}} profile of individuals with ASD remains only partly understood. The debate focuses in particular on whether differences in autistic visual perception should be conceptualized as either a local bias or a global deficit. Proper quantitative reviews of the available data, in which the overall effect size of each study is assessed and the influence of potential moderators is investigated, are lacking. Objectives: We combined all available experimental data on local and global visual processing in ASD from 1983 till 2011 through meta-analytic techniques, and (a) assessed whether the available data are in favor of the hypothesis of superior local processing or the hypothesis of inferior global processing, in individuals with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) controls, (b) evaluated the conceptualization of local and global visual processing in different paradigms and measures, and (c) evaluated which <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> rule the diversity within the literature. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed. All data of the 44 selected articles were coded and transformed to the standardized mean difference metric d and used in a linear three-level random effects model, accounting for random sampling fluctuation, between-outcome variance and between-study variance. Further analyses carefully extended the model by including one or more of nine <b>moderator</b> <b>variables,</b> comprising ASD subtype, type of control group, sample size, gender, age, IQ, experimental paradigm or task, dependent variable, and assumed direction of group difference (e. g. enhanced local versus reduced global). Results: Overall, we found no significant performance difference in visual processing between individuals with ASD and controls. Yet, analyses investigating the individual or combined influence of <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> showed significantly reduced performance of the ASD group for tasks inducing a global processing advantage (especially as measured by reaction times), but no effect for task elements inducing a local processing advantage (nor when accuracy measures were used). The <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> age, gender and IQ yielded mixed results, whereas the specific subtype of ASD did not have any effect. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis favor the evidence for a deficit in global visual processing in ASD rather than an advantage in local processing in ASD. Though several important <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> have been included in the study, further research is necessary to identify more clearly which (other) <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> are at play and how they influence visual processing abilities in individuals with ASD versus controls. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding [...] "third" [...] variables, media {{violence}} {{researchers who}} argue for causal effects acknowledge that other variables {{may play a}} role in aggression (Bushman & Anderson, 2001) and that aggression is due to a confluence of variables. These variables are known as [...] "third variables" [...] and if found, would probably be mediator variables (which differ from moderator variables). A mediator variable could 'explain away' media violence effects, whereas a <b>moderator</b> <b>variable</b> cannot. For instance, some scholars contend that trait aggressiveness has been demonstrated to moderate media violence effects (Bushman), although in some studies [...] "trait aggression" [...] does appear to account for any link between media violence exposure and aggression. Other variables have also been found to moderate media violence effects (Bushman & Geen, 1990). Another issue is the way in which experimental studies deal with potential confounding variables. Researchers use random assignment to attempt to neutralize the effects of what commonly are cited as third variables (i.e. gender, trait aggressiveness, preference for violent media). Because experimental designs employ random assignment to conditions, the effect of such attributive variables on experimental results is assumed to be random (not systematic). However, the same can not be said for correlational studies, and failure to control for such variables in correlational studies limits the interpretation of such studies. Often, something as simple as gender proves capable of [...] "mediating" [...] media violence effects.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a meta-analytic review of {{interventions}} {{that focus on}} the promotion of family wellness and the prevention of child maltreatment. Fifty-six evaluations which met the inclusion criteria were coded and effect sizes were calculated for each of the studies. I identiﬁed ﬁve key elements or “moderator variables,” through a review of the literature, which I believed might {{have an impact on the}} effectiveness of interventions. These <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> were: an ecological framework, an empowerment/strengths-based focus, the duration/intensity of the intervention, and the availability of social support and concrete support. A three step model testing process was used to evaluate the impact of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> on the effectiveness of the interventions. In Step 1, the impact of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> was tested across the entire sample of 56 studies. In Step 2, the studies were subdivided according to program type before testing for the impact of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variables.</b> There were eight distinct types of programs; four were proactive and four were reactive. In Step 3, testing for the impact of the <b>moderator</b> <b>variables</b> occurred after the studies were subdivided by both program type and outcome measure. Lastly post-assessment and follow-up effect sizes were examined separately to identify any possible trends. Findings indicated that although the proactive and reactive interventions had similar mean effect sizes (. 37 and. 43, respectively), the effect sizes for the proactive interventions tended to be larger at follow-up than post-assessment, while the effect sizes for the reactive interventions tended to have higher effect sizes at post-assessment than follow-up. This indicates that gains made through proactive interventions are sustained, and even enhanced, over longer periods of time, compared with those of reactive interventions. Other ﬁndings revealed that for home visiting interventions, higher effect sizes were found for interventions which were longer in duration and higher in intensity, and that interventions with components of social and concrete support had lower effect sizes than interventions without those components. Intensive family preservation interventions with high levels of participant involvement in program planning and implementation, an empowerment/strengths-based focus, and a component of social support had higher effect sizes than interventions without those elements. Lastly, both home visiting and intensive family preservation interventions achieved higher effect sizes with participants having mixed socio-economic status than those working solely with participants having low socio-economic status...|$|R
