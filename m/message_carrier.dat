In this paper, we {{investigate}} the potential of food as a social <b>message</b> <b>carrier</b> (a. k. a., food messaging). To investigate how people accept, use, and perceive food messaging, we conducted exploratory interviews, a field study, and follow-up interviews over four weeks in a large information technology (IT) company. We collected 904 messages sent by 343 users. Our results suggest strong acceptance of food messaging as an alternative message channel. Further analysis implies that food messaging embodies characteristics of both text messaging and gifting. It is preferred in close relationships for its evocation of positive emotions. As the first field study on edible social messaging, our empirical findings provide valuable insights into the uniqueness of food as a <b>message</b> <b>carrier</b> and its capabilities to promote greater social bonding...|$|E

As the number of <b>message</b> <b>carriers</b> becomes large these schemes experience diminishing marginal benefits from the addition of more <b>message</b> <b>carriers.</b> We describe and analyze the Simple Counting Protocol, an extremely simple and robust method for limiting the fraction of nodes that carry a copy of a message. We examine the performance of this protocol in conjunction with several abstract mobility models and show that the protocol performs reasonably well in diverse circumstances. The Simple Counting Protocol does not assume much about node mobility, and therefore should be useful for applications where little is known about node encounter patterns. The simplicity of its implementation will hopefully make it a useful substitute for epidemic routing as a naive lower bound in protocol performance comparisons. We also show how the same simple techniques and principles can be applied in conjunction with more complex heuristic DTN protocols to reduce network resource usage, a scheme we call Intermediate Immunity...|$|R

In order to minimize the error introduced due to hiding foreign <b>message</b> <b>carrier</b> into the cover image, a robust and secure algorithm will be introduced, which might be used efficiently to protect the embedded message against attacks. The idea in the new approach depends on spreading the secret message over the cover image using both a pseudo random number generator and a hash function that drive one bit from each block of pixels in a random sequence manner. The intensity of each random pixel is predicted based on the average weighted sum value of the surrounding pixels. The difference between each random pixel is calculated causing a deviation error to be introduced. An error correction function will then be used to minimize the error introduced due to hiding foreign <b>message</b> <b>carrier</b> into the cover image and hence minimizing degradation of the embedded images.

SAURP aims to explore the possibility of taking mobile nodes as <b>message</b> <b>carriers</b> in order for end-to-end delivery of the <b>messages.</b> The best <b>carrier</b> for a <b>message</b> is determined by the prediction result using a novel contact model, where the network status, including wireless link condition and nodal buffer availability, are jointly considered. The paper argues and proves that the nodal movement and the predicted collocation with the message recipient can serve as meaningful information to achieve an intelligent message forwarding decision at each node. The proposed protocol has been implemented and compared with a number of existing encounter-based routing approaches in terms of delivery delay, and the number of transmissions required for message delivery. The simulation results show that the proposed SAURP outperforms all the counterpart multi-copy encounter-based routing protocols considered in the study...|$|R
