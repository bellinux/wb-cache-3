40|$|In Italy, the {{introduction}} of Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) has been decided but postponed, as a national programme, until 2015, when data from Regions which have already implemented it will be available. Starting from 2003, eight Italian Regions (Basilicata, Calabria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Apulia, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany and Veneto) have progressively introduced UVV, in their immunization programme, with different schedules in children aged 13 - 15 months and 5 - 6 years, currently a two-dose schedule is adopted by all Regions. In June 2013, an <b>Interregional</b> <b>Group</b> on Varicella Vaccination (IGVV) {{has been established in}} order to assess the effectiveness of varicella vaccination with standardized and shared tools. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of varicella vaccination on the incidence and hospitalizations due to varicella and its complications in the period 2003 - 2012 in order to support the Italian decision makers on the future national adoption. Preliminary data showed that a general reduction of incidence and hospitalization rates was observed in the study period, resulting in relevant savings for the National Health Service. Immunization coverage with first dose at 24 months of age was high in all Regions (84 %- 95 %) in 2012. Adverse events due to varicella vaccines were rare and without permanent sequelae. Underreporting of varicella cases and delays in the administration of the first dose of varicella vaccines were the main critical issues. In conclusion, solid evidences in support of universal UVV arise from the experiences available today in Italy...|$|R
5|$|In August 1990 several leading {{officials}} {{tried to}} persuade Gorbachev to force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected {{a member of the}} Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990 the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union support for Ryzhkov's economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov's economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary <b>Interregional</b> <b>Group's</b> vote of no confidence in Ryzhkov's government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet's resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov's orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.|$|R
40|$|The March 1989 {{elections}} to the USSR Congress of People 9 ̆ 2 s Deputies (CPD) {{marked the first}} time that even remotely open and democratic elections had taken place in Russia since the birth of the Soviet Union in 1917. The 1989 elections can be viewed as the progenitor of the current political situation in Russia for it was those first elections that launched the long and rocky devolution of the centralized, one-party Soviet state into the multiparty Russian system that faced the electorate {{for the first time this}} December 12. A great deal has changed in Russia since the first contested elections at the national level took place across the USSR almost five years ago. So much in fact [...] the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the one-party monopoly on power and the introduction of market reforms, to name but a few significant alterations [...] that it is easy to lose sight of the beginnings of this fascinating process of political change. When candidates faced the Russian electorate in December 1993 in the {{elections to}} the newlyconstituted Russian parliament, they followed a path first sketched out during the Soviet Union 9 ̆ 2 s previous experiment with broad-based democracy, the USSR CPD. A number of the current players in Russian politics started learning the rules of the game during 1989 - 1990, the first years of the 9 ̆ 3 democratic 9 ̆ 4 Soviet legislature. Figures such as Boris Yeltsin, Nikolai Travkin, Gavriil Popov, Anatolii Sobchak, and many others who have been active participants in the modern Russian political scene rose to national prominence in the crucible of the USSR CPD. Many of the traits which now characterize the Russian political scene developed in the formative period of Russian democracy. The interactions among and within these first political groupings [...] the <b>Interregional</b> <b>Group,</b> the fragmenting Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and its factions, as well as other informal (neformal 9 ̆ 2 nye) organizations [...] greatly influenced the direction Russian politics were to take. The experiences of these political figures during the first year of the newly-constituted USSR CPD were to guide them during the growth of democratic organizations within Russia. An understanding of the origins of the current trend of political party formation is a key factor to understanding why the Russian political arena is the way it appears today. After the March 1989 elections to the USSR CPD, a wave of political organization took place as deputies allied with one another and against the perceived opposition. In many ways, the USSR CPD is the parent of the present Russian political system. They are so linked because the newly-independent Russian state, as the successor to the Soviet Union after its collapse in December 1991, inherited its nascent political system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase ('statins') {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} hypolipidaemic drugs, {{which have been}} evaluated in several clinical trials involving {{hundreds of thousands of}} patients. From a safety perspective, both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have demonstrated that statins are generally well tolerated, with rare serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that affect mainly muscle, liver and kidney. However, recent interest has been focused on a potential risk of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins, including memory loss, depression, suicidality, aggression and antisocial behaviour. Special attention is currently being paid to the potential for statin-induced sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that statins may be associated with psychiatric adverse events using quantitative and qualitative signal analysis. METHODS: The <b>Interregional</b> <b>Group</b> of Pharmacovigilance database holds reports of suspected ADRs submitted since 1988 from eight Italian regions. In the present analysis, only reports ranked at least 'possible', according to WHO causality assessment criteria, were considered. Association between statins and psychiatric events was assessed by the case/non-case methodology, calculating the ADR reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a measure of disproportionality. Cases were defined as patients with at least one reported ADR combined with the system organ class (SOC) 'psychiatric disorders'. The non-cases comprised all patients who did not experience an ADR related to the SOC 'psychiatric disorders'. Index reports comprised all ADR reports involving at least one statin, while all ADR reports not involving statins as suspected drugs were used as controls. RESULTS: According to selection criteria, 35, 314 reports were included in the analysis. A total of 71 psychiatric preferred terms combined with statins were identified in 60 reports. Among them, 14 reports (23. 3 %) noted a positive rechallenge. Both the unadjusted (0. 8; 95 % CI 0. 6, 1. 1) and adjusted ROR (0. 7; 95 % CI 0. 6, 1. 0) suggested a lower rate of reports of psychiatric events for statins as a whole class compared with all other drugs, although the difference was not significant. The five most frequently reported psychiatric events combined with statins were insomnia, somnolence, agitation, confusion and hallucination. Only insomnia was reported with higher frequency for statins compared with all other drugs (ROR = 3. 3; 95 % CI 1. 9, 5. 7), while confusion was reported with a lower frequency (ROR = 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 1, 0. 9). Amongst statins available in Italy, only simvastatin (ROR = 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 2, 0. 9) showed a significantly lower rate of reports of psychiatric events compared with all other drugs together. CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of possible statin-associated psychiatric ADRs have been found in our database. No significant risks for a higher overall reporting of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins were identified in comparison with all other drugs combined. However, statin-associated insomnia resulted in a significant ROR that requires further investigation...|$|R
50|$|Within United Cities and Local Governments, the <b>Interregional</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Commission {{is at the}} {{junction}} of three regional sections: Europe, Africa, and the Middle East/West Asia. The Mediterranean occupies {{a special place in}} UCLG due to the large amount of direct members in the three regions North, South, and East of the Mediterranean and because of the many cooperation initiatives that connect local authorities and the common policies for regional development. Following the Med Urbs program, a “network culture” of trans-Mediterranean local authorities was created in the Mediterranean, reinforced by the Euro-Mediterranean partnership: Medcities, the network of Euromed cities (previously the Euromed group of Eurocities), the Standing Committee for the Euro Mediterranean Partnership of Local and Regional Authorities (COPPEM), the Europe-MENA Urban Network, Latin Arch, the Inter-Mediterranean Commission of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR), and the European network of local authorities for peace in the Middle East (COEPPO) are some of the networks that intersect with a variety of networks of civil society, universities and initiatives of the private sector. It appeared that the three regional sections of UCLG together could reinforce exchanges and encourage taking into consideration the specific interests of local Mediterranean authorities, whether on matters related to Euro-Mediterranean relations or on strategic issues like decentralization, urban development, or the environment, particularly access to and water management.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} impacts that large-scale alcohol {{production from}} corn, grain sorghum, and crop residues {{may have on}} U. S. agriculture in the year 2000 are investigated. A one land <b>group</b> <b>interregional</b> linear programming model is used. The objective function is to minimize the cost of production in the agricultural sector, given specified crop demands and constrained resources;The impacts that levels of alcohol production, ranging from zero to 12 billion gallons, have at two projected levels of crop demands, two grain-to-alcohol conversion and two milling methods, wet and dry, rates are considered. At the lower level of crop demands, 1980 crop exports are used and at the higher level of demands, one-half times 1980 crop exports are used. A rate of conversion which reflects current technology, 2. 6 gallons of alcohol per bushel of grain, and one which reflects a maximum potential rate of conversion, 3. 0 gallons per bushel of grain, are incorporated into the model;The impacts that large-scale fuel alcohol production has on U. S. agriculture are small. The major impacts that occur are the substitution of milling by-products, DDG, gluten feed, and gluten meal, for soybean meal in livestock feed rations. Production of 12 billion gallons of alcohol {{is estimated to be}} equivalent to an 18 percent increase in crop exports. Improving the grain-to-alcohol conversion rate from 2. 6 to 3. 0 gallons per bushels reduces the overall cost of agricultural production by 989 billion when 12 billion gallons of alcohol are produced...|$|R
40|$|We {{recognized}} this bird damage problem from an agricultural standpoint around 1950. It seemingly was growing {{and when we}} looked into it; it later appeared {{that this was the}} case. The problem was quickly resolved to be primarily red-winged blackbirds in corn. We also have problems of damage to fruit crops such as apples, or peaches by starling and other birds, in grapes probably by warblers and most certainly star¬lings in certain seasons. But, this isn 2 ̆ 7 t as consistent and persistent at the corn damage by red-winged blackbirds. We began about 8 years ago to make a survey and we got the blessing of everybody concerned to run an ecological project. In this ecological project we were going to determine the life history and the eco¬logy, the interrelationships, the behavior of the blackbirds, and we did this and came up with many of the same results that you 2 ̆ 7 ve heard about today. That is, the previous speakers have practically summed up our findings. They 2 ̆ 7 re the same; they 2 ̆ 7 re uniform. In some cases we used their findings to come to some of our conclusions. We also formed an <b>interregional</b> agricultural <b>group</b> to determine what could be done. Because the north central agricultural research experiment station directors were not in accord with operating this program in the north-central region, Ohio joined the northeast region and the chairman, Dr. Philip Granett of Rutgers University, of the northeast region is present at this meeting, and I 2 ̆ 7 ll probably have him tell you about this a little bit later.

40|$|During the {{programming}} period 2007 - 2013 the Cohesion Policy of EU has adopted and implemented {{the policy of}} territorial co-operation between EU Member States but also between EU and third countries. In this framework, the EU co-finances (through the European Regional Development Fund, the pre-accession instrument and the instrument of European neighbourhood policy) a series of cross-border, interregional and transnational co-operation programmes in the Mediterranean Basin. These are programs with economic, political, social and environmental objectives. Specifically, in this area bilateral cross-border co-operation programmes among all EU <b>Mediterranean</b> countries, multinational <b>interregional</b> co-operation programmes (IPA Adriatic, MED ENPI CBC) and transnational co-operation on territorial cohesion of Macro-regions (Programme Med) are implemented. All EU Mediterranean countries {{and most of the}} countries of North Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Sea are eligible to the mentioned programmes. The aim {{of this study is to}} conduct an interim evaluation of these programs and make suggestions for the new programming period for Cohesion Policy 2014 - 2020. After the presentation of the theoretical foundation of territorial cooperation we describe the framework and objectives of EU policy of territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Macro-region as well as the multilateral and transnational cross border cooperation programmes. In a further step we summarize the main achievements and failures of the territorial cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean. We conclude that there are important differences in the path of implementation of the programmes due to many factors like the experience of the partner countries in planning methods and cooperation schemes, the existence (or not) of cooperation structures and clusters, the source of funds (e. g. ERDF, IPA, ENPI, national co-financing), bureaucracy, the culture of cooperation and in some cases political disputes. The evaluation of other aspects like the organization and management of the programmes, the eligibility of expenditure and the approval process of the projects, the monitoring and implementation procedures, the thematic and geographical allocation of the approved projects, highlight many problems that should be solved in the next programming period 2014 - 2020, in order to improve the effectiveness of the European Territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Basin and promote economic, social, spatial and environmental cohesion of this macro-region...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many {{researchers}} have used graph theory {{to study the}} aberrant brain structures in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) and have made great progress. However, {{the characteristics of the}} cortical network in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are still largely unexplored. In this study, the gray matter volumes obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for all brain regions except the cerebellum were parcellated into 90 areas using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template to construct cortical networks for 98 normal controls (NCs), 113 MCIs and 91 ADs. The measurements of the network properties were calculated {{for each of the three}} groups respectively. We found that all three cortical networks exhibited small-world properties and those strong interhemispheric correlations existed between bilaterally homologous regions. Among the three cortical networks, we found the greatest clustering coefficient and the longest absolute path length in AD, which might indicate that the organization of the cortical network was the least optimal in AD. The small-world measures of the MCI network exhibited intermediate values. This finding is logical given that MCI is considered to be the transitional stage between normal aging and AD. Out of all the between-group differences in the clustering coefficient and absolute path length, only the differences between the AD and normal control groups were statistically significant. Compared with the normal controls, the MCI and AD groups retained their hub regions in the frontal lobe but showed a loss of hub regions in the temporal lobe. In addition, altered interregional correlations were detected in the parahippocampus gyrus, medial temporal lobe, cingulum, fusiform, medial frontal lobe, and orbital frontal gyrus in groups with MCI and AD. Similar to previous studies of functional connectivity, we also revealed increased interregional correlations within the local brain lobes and disrupted long distance <b>interregional</b> correlations in <b>groups</b> with MCI and AD...|$|R
