40|$|The {{experiences}} of submarine warfare from WWI and WWII have generally dictated <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> <b>when</b> designing conventional submarines. Technological development of submarine and antisubmarine weapons, however, requires examination of submarine warfare and tactics. This thesis {{focuses on a}} coastal conventional submarine's ability to survive, {{as a function of}} its <b>maximum</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>when</b> attacked by a light antisubmarine warfare (ASW) torpedo. It also evaluates the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> with which the submarine should be equipped to ensure a specified probability of survival. The measure of effectiveness (MOB) is the probability that the submarine, operating up to <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> and launching only one set of countermeasures, is not caught by the torpedo. The investigation builds on a discrete event simulation model. The systems simulated are a submarine, a light ASW torpedo, and a countermeasure system consisting of one decoy and four jammers.

Due {{to the absence}} of wires and external modules, it is less likely the OpenGo insoles influence gait characteristics. Aims: To determine the OpenGo’s concurrent validity of center of pressure and temporal gait parameters and its test-retest reliability of temporal gait parameters. Methods: Center of pressure data (i. e. standard deviation, range, and velocity) were collected under eyes open and closed conditions with participants performing unilateral stance trials on a force plate wearing the OpenGo between socks. Temporal gait data (i. e. cadence, stance time, and gait cycle time) were collected at self-selected comfortable and <b>maximum</b> walking <b>speeds</b> with participants performing test-retest walking trials on an instrumented treadmill wearing the OpenGo in their own shoes. Validity was determined with ICC(2, 1) and Bland-Altman plots. Reliability was determined with ICC(2, 1) and smallest detectable changes were calculated. Results: Twenty healthy persons volunteered. Center of pressure validity ICCs ranged from 0. 01 - 0. 57. Temporal validity ICCs ranged from 0. 89 - 0. 99 at comfortable speed, and from 0. 20 - 0. 99 at <b>maximum</b> <b>speed.</b> Temporal reliability ICCs ranged from 0. 90 - 0. 93 at comfortable speed, and from 0. 77 - 0. 94 at <b>maximum</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>When</b> excluding extreme outliers from analyses stance time validity increased.
