40|$|The {{effects of}} a 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{challenge}} infusion on pulmonary function values were studied in healthy calves, pretreated with varying doses of <b>metrenperone,</b> a selective type 2 serotonergic (5 -HT 2) antagonist. In {{the first part of}} the experiment, the 5 -HT challenge was performed 30 minutes after administration of <b>metrenperone</b> at a dose of 0. 025 mg kg- 1 (group 1, n = 8), 0. 050 mg kg- 1 (group 2, n = 8) and 0. 100 mg kg- 1 (group 3, n = 7). In the second part, the 5 -HT challenge was performed 12 hours after administration of <b>metrenperone</b> at a dose of 0. 050 mg kg- 1 (group 4, n = 5) and 0. 100 mg kg- 1 (group 5, n = 5). None of the three doses of <b>metrenperone</b> influenced the 5 -HT-induced ventilatory changes. For the challenge performed 30 minutes after blockade, all three doses inhibited the bronchoconstrictive process triggered by the 5 -HT challenge. There was no dose-related inhibition. On the other hand, when the challenge was performed 12 hours after <b>metrenperone,</b> there was a dose-related inhibition with only the higher dose (0. 100 mg kg- 1) showing a significant efficacy in inhibiting 5 -HT-induced bronchoconstriction. It is concluded that, if 5 -HT is involved in the pathophysiological processes of respiratory diseases in cattle, a 5 -HT 2 blockade with <b>metrenperone</b> at a dose rate of 0. 100 mg kg- 1 and with a dosage interval of 12 hours should improve pulmonary function.

40|$|Eighteen of 91 seven- to nine-month-old Belgian {{white and}} blue double-muscled male {{fattening}} cattle developed typical signs of shipping fever. They were all injected intramuscularly once a day for three days with 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin, and in addition nine selected at random were injected intramuscularly five times at 12 hour intervals with 0. 1 mg/kg of <b>metrenperone,</b> a 5 -hydroxytryptamine blocker, the other nine receiving a placebo. During the outbreak of shipping fever <b>metrenperone</b> showed effective antipyretic properties, and all the calves treated with it made a complete recovery. Moreover, during the 360 day fattening period following the outbreak, the cattle treated with <b>metrenperone</b> gained on average 45. 4 kg more weight than the control cattle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} saline (control, group C) and <b>metrenperone</b> (treated, group M) on {{systemic}} and pulmonary hemodynamics were determined in conscious 7 - to 15 -day-old calves {{after they were}} intratracheally inoculated with Pasteurella haemolytica. <b>Metrenperone,</b> a specific serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) receptor antagonist, was injected intramuscularly (100 micrograms. kg- 1) 2 h after the calves were inoculated. Central venous, pulmonary arterial and capillary wedge, and systemic arterial pressures were measured, using fluid-filled catheters. Cardiac output {{was measured by the}} thermodilution technique. Heart rate, stroke volume, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were calculated. The parameters were measured hourly from the 1 st to the 10 th h after inoculation. In group C, cardiovascular response to P. haemolytica inoculation was marked and typically consisted of two systemic hypotensive phases and two pulmonary hypertensive phases. The first phase occurred by the 2 nd h post inoculation and was induced by a transient bradycardia and a systemic vasodilation, leading to profound hypotension and reduced venous return. Cardiac performance then transiently recovered, but systemic hypotension persisted. The second hypotensive hypodynamic phase occurred by the 7 th h after inoculation, and was associated with a decline in stroke volume, an increase in heart rate, and pulmonary hypertension and vasoconstriction. In group M, the early response to P. haemolytica exposure was similar to that in controls, indicating that, as in sheep, 5 -hydroxytryptamine does not contribute to the early hypodynamic response to endotoxemia. In contrast, <b>metrenperone</b> completely abolished late increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, suggesting that 5 -hydroxytryptamine contributes to the late pulmonary vasoconstriction. <b>Metrenperone</b> treatment also allowed better restoration of heart rate, and hence, cardiac output was maintained. In conclusion, 5 -hydroxytryptamine might have a role in mediating pasteurellic endotoxin induced changes in pulmonary hemodynamics through its type- 2 receptors. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>metrenperone</b> on healing of unilateral, collagenase-induced lesions in the Superficial Digital Flexor Tendons (SDFT) of rabbits. Methods: After controlled injury of the left SDFT, nine rabbits received daily treatment with <b>metrenperone</b> for 28 days. Another nine were untreated controls; in both groups the contra-lateral tendons served as uninjured controls. Histological and ultrastructural changes, mechanical properties, dry weight, collagen content, and amount of DNA in healing and control tendons were assessed 28 days after injury. Results: Restoration of structural hierarchy was more organized in treated than in untreated tendons while cellularity was greater in the latter. At the ultrastructural level, collagen in treated lesions was predominantly {{in the form of}} small-diameter, new fibrils, with few large, old fibrils; in untreated lesions there was a high proportion of large, old fibrils but relatively few small, new ones. The amount of DNA in untreated injuries was much greater than in normal tendons, while in treated lesions it was not significantly different from that of uninjured controls. There {{were no significant differences in}} total collagen, stiffness and ultimate strength of injured, treated, and untreated tendons 28 days after injury. Both were significantly weaker than their corresponding contralaterals. Conclusions: The findings suggest that <b>metrenperone</b> had positive effects on collagen turnover, remodelling, and organization during acute inflammation and fibroplasia. Provided that the new fibrils subsequently matured in a normal manner, mechanical characteristics of the organized scar should be better than those of an untreated lesion. Ahmad Oryan, Ian A.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{response to}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) challenge {{has been previously}} described in cattle. Abrupt bradycardia, followed by tachycardia, triphasic systemic blood pressure response, and pulmonary hypertension were the major changes elicited by 5 -HT. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether the cardiovascular response to 5 -HT in calves was attributable to 5 -HT 2 receptors. A specific 5 -HT 2 antagonist (<b>metrenperone,</b> 0. 05 mg/kg) was administered intramuscular to six unsedated Friesian calves 30 min before the animals were given a 5 -min intravenous 5 -HT infusion. Mean systemic arterial (SAP), mean pulmonary arterial (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge (PW) pressures were obtained by means of fluid-filled catheters, and cardiac output (CO) was measured by the thermodilution technique. Heart rate, stroke volume, systemic (SVR) and pulmonary (PVR) vascular resistances were calculated. Administration of 5 -HT after <b>metrenperone</b> induced a short-lasting period of severe bradycardia followed by tachycardia and increased CO. The systemic blood pressure response was exclusively hypotensive and associated with a decrease in SVR. Conversely, PAP, PW, and PVR were not modified by 5 -HT administration. The results establish that 5 -HT induced systemic as well as pulmonary hypertension is mediated through the activation of type- 2 serotonergic or alpha-adrenergic receptors, or both. In contrast, neither apnoea, bradycardia and hypotension, nor the positive chronotropic effect induced by 5 -HT in cattle are mediated through such receptors. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Ninety-four Belgian White and Blue double-muscled calves were {{involved}} in this study which aimed to compare the efficacy of a serotonin-S 2 receptor blockade at two different stages of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), i. e. at the occurrence of first clinical signs or when another anti-inflammatory compound was clinically shown to be ineffective. <b>Metrenperone,</b> a 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT 2) blocker, was injected (intramuscularly, 5 times, at 12 hourly intervals, dose rate: 0. 1 mg/kg) to (1) 58 calves referred to our laboratory after a treatment (group I) which lasted from 3 to 5 days and which did not improve the clinical status of the animals and (2) 36 calves investigated as soon as first clinical signs occurred (group II). Following {{the severity of the}} ARDS, the animals from group I needed to be classified into 2 groups: group IA (moderate ARDS - n = 45) and group IB (severe ARDS - n = 13). For animals in group I, the antibacterial compound previously used was maintained and administered during 4 more days whilst the previous anti-inflammatory drug was suppressed and replaced by <b>metrenperone</b> administered as mentioned above. In group II, each animal was treated with ceftiofur sodium as an antibacterial agent. A clinical score and a breathing score were calculated at each step of the investigation period, i. e. before (T 0) and 1 hour (T 1) after the first treatment, during the interval 12 H- 48 H (T 2) which followed this treatment and 168 H (T 3) after this treatment. Four clinical parameters were also taken into account separately: rectal and cutaneous temperatures, respiratory and heart rates. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the mechanism by which 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) modifies respiratory function, specifically, hyperventilation, diffuse bronchoconstriction, and pulmonary arterial hypertension in cattle. We determined whether the IV response to 5 -HT in calves was attributable to stimulation of 5 -HT 2 receptors. Six healthy unsedated young bull calves of the Friesian (n = 4) and of the Belgian White and Blue (n = 2) breeds were used. A specific 5 -HT 2 antagonist (<b>metrenperone,</b> 0. 05 mg/kg of body weight) was administered IM 30 minutes before the cattle were given a 5 -minute IV 5 -HT infusion. Pulmonary function values were registered before, during, and after the 5 -HT challenge infusion. Minute volume increased significantly, because of an increase in respiratory rate. Conversely, lung dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, and pulmonary arterial pressure were not changed. We concluded that in cattle, 5 -HT-induced ventilatory response is not mediated through activation of 5 -HT 2 receptors. However, the 5 -HT 2 receptors are involved in 5 -HT-induced broncho- and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|During this investigation, which {{involved}} 58 Belgian White and Blue double-muscled calves {{affected by a}} naturally occurring Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the clinical efficiency of a 5 -HT 2 receptor blockade with <b>metrenperone</b> (group A) was compared to the efficiency of a non-steroidal (flunixine meglumine [...] group B) and a steroidal (prednisolone sodium succinate [...] group C) antiinflammatory drug. Each animal of this trial was treated with ceftiofur sodium as antimicrobial agent. A clinical score and a breathing score were calculated at {{each step of the}} investigation period, i. e. before (T 0) and 1 hour (T 1), 12 hours (H), 24 H, 48 H and 168 H (T 3) after the first treatment, the interval 12 H- 48 H being considered as period T 2. Three clinical parameters were also taken into account separately: rectal and peripheral temperatures and heart rate. A significant improvement of the clinical score was registered at T 2 in group A and at T 3 in groups A and B, while this score did not significantly change in group C. In group A, the breathing score was significantly improved at T 2 and T 3, but not in groups B and C. Peripheral and rectal temperatures recorded at T 1 were, in group A, significantly increased and decreased respectively, but not significantly changed in groups B and C. The proportions requiring change of treatment during the investigation period were significantly (P = 0. 022) different in the three groups, being 5. 6, 21. 4 and 50. 0 % in groups A, B and C respectively.
