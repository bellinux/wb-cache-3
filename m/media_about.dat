C-SPAN brought back the Convention Hub for the 2012 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, {{but it was never}} issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of <b>media</b> <b>about</b> lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E
5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.|$|E

40|$|Many parents fail to {{interact}} with their children regularly <b>about</b> <b>media</b> content and past research has identified few predictors of parents’ engagement in parental mediation behaviors. The present study explored the relationship between parents’ critical thinking <b>about</b> <b>media</b> and parents’ provision of both active and restrictive mediation of television content. Results revealed that parents’ critical thinking <b>about</b> <b>media</b> is positively associated with both active and restrictive mediation, relationships mediated by parents’ attitudes toward parent-child interactions <b>about</b> <b>media.</b> These findings suggest that media literacy programs aimed at improving parents’ critical thinking <b>about</b> <b>media</b> may be {{an effective way to}} alter children’s responses to media exposure and that these media literacy programs should promote positive attitudes toward parental mediation...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass <b>media</b> <b>about</b> the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E

5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
5|$|India had {{not lost}} a home test series since 1987 (against Pakistan) and when South Africa toured India in February – March 2000, that streak was ended as India lost the home series 2–0. However events outside the field overshadowed the cricket: Before {{start of the}} series, Tendulkar {{announced}} his decision to relinquish the captaincy after the Test matches, Azharuddin and Mongia were recalled to the team, controversy arose over Azharuddin's injury leading to his exclusion from the First Test. Ganguly was made {{the captain of the}} Indian team for the one-day series. Talks in the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> no way but 'UP' were not unfounded when India took a 2–0 lead in the ODI Series and finishing the series at 3–2, after South Africa won the last two matches. It was learnt later that South Africa's captain Cronje was involved in betting and there were attempts to buy-off South African players by Cronje and bookmakers. At the end of the series, the media felt that Ganguly's attitude and captaincy was heartening. In March 2000, India participated in a triangular series with South Africa and Pakistan. India won only one of their four matches and missed the finals.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 2013, Zakuani was {{selected}} by Portland Timbers as the number two pick in the MLS Re-Entry Draft; a yearly draft that allows teams to select players who are out-of-contract or have had their options declined by their current teams. The Timbers traded up for the opportunity. Zakuani was reunited with Caleb Porter, his former Akron coach, who had become the Portland manager. His pay was cut by $60,000 to $120,000 a year. Zakuani was expected to receive additional minutes immediately because first-choice winger Rodney Wallace was recovering from injury. Zakuani appeared in the Timbers' opening match of 2014 against Philadelphia Union as a substitute in the 85th minute. The Sounders and Timbers are fierce rivals; when the teams met in the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Zakuani assisted former college team-mate Darlington Nagbe in the Timbers' only goal during the 3–1 loss to his previous club. Zakuani scored his first goal for Timbers on 19 August 2014, scoring the opening goal in a 4–1 win over Alpha United in the 2014–15 CONCACAF Champions League. After the match, Porter spoke to the <b>media</b> <b>about</b> the need to bench Zakuani because of his persistent muscle strains.|$|E
