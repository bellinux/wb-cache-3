Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.|$|E

She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, [...] "I know that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fans read manga, and I'm really excited {{to be involved in}} creating stories that I know they will enjoy." [...] The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007.

500|$|Described as Andrew Schwab's opus {{the record}} {{promises}} to be a fresh take on the P86 sound. Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really able to take the reins of the creative process in a direction I was passionate about. I was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what its about. I am really looking forward to people hearing this album." [...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E

He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1994, the {{eviction}} of Claremont Road took place, bringing {{an end to}} the M11 {{link road}} resistance as a major physical protest. Bailiffs, accompanied by the police in full riot gear, carried out the eviction over several days, and the Central line, running adjacent to the road, was suspended. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost to the taxpayer was over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, [...] "I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060." [...] Cohen complained in parliament about police brutality, stating [...] "were not <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?" [...] The then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, pointed out that there had already been three public enquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against the line of the route.|$|E
500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] is {{the opening}} track on Tove Lo's debut {{extended}} play, Truth Serum. According to the artist, {{the songs on}} the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship from beginning to end, which started [...] "really happy and passionate". Following the narrative of Truth Serum, the track conveys the time when Lo was [...] "really {{in love with someone}} and [...] think straight" [...] and felt [...] "high" [...] all the time. She also stated that she wanted to write a happy and euphoric song that represented the positive beginning of her relationships, since most of her tracks are about the decay of them. In an interview with MTV UK, the artist said, [...] "'Not On Drugs' is, like <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songs so far, about love. At least it's about the happy kind of love where you feel like there's nothing that can get you higher than the person you're with and have these feelings for". [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was also included in [...] "The Love" [...] section of Lo's debut studio record, Queen of the Clouds, a concept album that describes the pattern of the singer's relationships.|$|E
500|$|Rossen {{was one of}} the {{directors}} who developed film gris (French for [...] "grey film"). In his films for Warner Brothers' between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After Dust Be My Destiny, written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for The New York Times, complained about Warner Brothers' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: [...] "The element common to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element in American life. It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization." [...] Polonsky commented that [...] "Rossen's talent is force applied everywhere without let-up." [...] Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen's works, but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness.|$|E

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. While most episodes consisted of two shorts that were about eleven minutes long or specials that lasted the whole episode, certain episodes were made of one full eleven-minute episode, and two shorts, one of which was seven minutes long and the other only four minutes long. The animation was handled overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the series run, from 1999 to 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants was drawn and animated using pencils. In 2008, the crew shifted and used Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings, instead of pencils. The episode [...] "Pest of the West" [...] was the first episode in the series that the crew used it.
