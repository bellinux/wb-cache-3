Spinning whorls, cotton seeds, remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry. Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze. The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and semi precious stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured. Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station. Building construction, pearl fishery and painting are other activities that have been supported by findings from these excavations.|$|E
60|$|But as yet I {{wandered in}} the Forum {{safe from the}} {{realization}} of its ugliness when it was in its glory. I cannot say that even now it is picturesque, but it is paintable, and certainly it is pathetic. Stumps of columns, high and low, stand about in the places where they stood in their unbroken pride, and though it seems a hardship {{that they should not}} have been left lying in the kindly earth or on it instead of being pulled up and set on end, it must be owned that they are scarcely overworked in their present postures. More touching are those inarticulate heaps, cairns of sculptured fragments, piled here and there together and waiting the knowledge which is some time to assort them and translate them into some measure of coherent meaning. But it must always be remembered that when they were coherent they were only beautiful parts of a whole that was brutally unbeautiful. We have but to use the little common-sense which Heaven has vouchsafed some of us in order to realize that Rome, either republican or imperial, was a state for which we can have no genuine reverence, and that mostly the ruins of her past can stir in us no finer emotion than wonder. But necessarily, for the sake of knowledge, and of ascertaining just what quantity and quality of human interest the <b>material</b> <b>records</b> of Roman antiquity embody, archaeology must devote itself with all possible piety to their recovery. The removal, handful by handful, of the earth from the grave of the past which the whole Forum is, tomb upon tomb, is as dramatic a spectacle as anything one can well witness; for that soil is richer than any gold-mine in its potentiality of treasure, and it must be strictly scrutinized, almost by particles, lest some gem of art should be cast aside with the accumulated rubbish of centuries. Yet this drama, poignantly suggestive as it always must be, was the least incident of that morning in the Forum which it was my fortune to pass there with other better if not older tourists as guest of the Genius Loci. It was not quite a public event, though the Commendatore Boni is so well known to the higher journalism, and even to fiction (as the reader of Anatole France's La Pierre Blanche will not have forgotten), that nothing which he archaeologically does is without public interest, and this excursion in the domain of antiquity was expected to result in identifying the site of the Temple of Jupiter Stator. It was conjectured that the temple vowed to this specific Jupiter for his public spirit in stopping the flight of a highly demoralized Roman army would be found where we actually found it. Archaeology seems to proceed by hypothesis, like other sciences, and to enjoy a forecast of events before they are actually accomplished. I do not say that I was very vividly aware of the event in question; I could not go now and show where the temple stood, but when I read of it in a cablegram to the American newspapers I almost felt that I had dug it up with my own hands.|$|E

50|$|According to Abraham, the Sangam era {{corresponds}} roughly to {{the period}} 300 BCE-300 CE, based on archaeology. Many historical sites have been excavated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, {{many of them in}} the second half of the 20th century. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu, located 3 km south of Pondicherry. According to Wheeler, it was an Indo-Roman trading station that flourished during the first two centuries CE. It has been suggested that Arikamedu was first established as a settlement c. 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE. Kodumanal and Perur, villages on the banks of the Noyyal river in Coimbatore district, were situated on the ancient trade route between Karur and the west coast, across the Palghat gap on the Western Ghats. Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age. Kaveripumpattinam, also known as Puhar or Poompuhar, is located near the Kaveri delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam. Excavations have been carried out both on-shore and off-shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region. The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE. Some of the off-shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea, as alluded to by the Sangam literature. Korkai, a port of the early Pandyas at the Tamraparani basin, is now located 7 km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition. Alagankulam, near the Vaigai delta, was another port city of the Pandyas and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years. Both the Pandyan ports have provided clues about local occupations, such as pearl fishing. Other sites that have yielded remnants from the Sangam age include Kanchipuram, Kunnattur, Malayampattu and Vasavasamudram along the Palar river; Sengamedu and Karaikadu along the Pennar river; Perur, Tirukkampuliyur, Alagarai and Urayur along the Kaveri river.These excavations have yielded different varieties of ceramics such as black and red ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds.

40|$|The {{quality of}} master data {{is crucial for}} the {{accurate}} functioning of the various modules of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study addresses specific data problems arising from the generation of approximately duplicate <b>material</b> <b>records</b> in ERP databases.

Traditional duplicate detection methods are ineffective in identifying such approximately duplicate <b>material</b> <b>records</b> because these methods typically rely on string comparisons of each field. To address this problem, a machine learning-based framework is developed to recognise semantic similarity between strings and to further identify and reunify approximately duplicate <b>material</b> <b>records</b> – a process referred to as de-duplication in this article. First, the keywords of the <b>material</b> <b>records</b> are extracted to form vectors of discriminating words.

40|$|When {{the metric}} system was {{introduced}} in Europe {{in the late eighteenth}} century, while the previous measurement systems disappeared, the very concept of architecture, tightly connected to it, was subverted. The previous geometric design had found in the various numeral bases of the ancient modules the appropriate framework linking the articulation of the shapes to the figures of geometry. These plots became legitimized by numerical theorems, series, proportions that made it easy to remember, to transfer and to operate the plan. The direct manual survey of the past tradition, described by analogical drawings, did not allow to recover all the contents of historical knowledge, forgotten after the scientific revolution, but attractive for the present. Part of the ancient knowledge is not preserved/stored in literary sources, but in material constructions, i. e. in monuments.

30|$|Archeological and {{volcanic}} {{materials have}} the potential to acquire a natural remanent magnetization (NRM) that is thermal in origin (termed a thermal remanent magnetization or TRM). TRM is obtained on cooling through a material’s Curie-temperature (Néel temperature) to room temperature and can be preserved over geological timescales depending on the magnetic grain size distribution of a particular material. A TRM can be treated as the summation of blocks of magnetization associated with discrete temperature ranges (called partial TRM or pTRM). In the laboratory it is possible to reverse the magnetization process (demagnetization). By repeatedly heating a material carrying a TRM in a zero-field to increasing temperature steps, pTRMs can be demagnetized and the magnetization history of the material can be recovered. After each temperature application, the magnitude of three orthogonal components of magnetization can be measured at room temperature. If the <b>material</b> <b>records</b> a direction representative of a spot reading of the geomagnetic field (without secondary contamination), the components of magnetization will linearly decrease to zero with increasing temperature and a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) direction (represented as declination and inclination) can be calculated for a particular temperature step or across a range of temperature steps.|$|E
