50|$|The mason's mitre {{allows the}} {{appearance}} of a <b>mitre</b> <b>joint</b> to be created with much less waste than occurs with a common <b>mitre</b> <b>joint,</b> in which triangular sections must be removed from the ends of both joint members.|$|E

50|$|The {{main reason}} that scribed joints are used is that timber shrinks in width {{far more than}} it does in length. By using a scribed joint rather than an {{internal}} <b>mitre</b> <b>joint</b> the effect of shrinkage is minimised. Also {{it is possible to}} arrange the scribed joints pointing away from the most common viewpoint (usually the doorway of a room) and so present the best appearance.|$|E

5000|$|In another {{assembly}} method, {{the pieces}} are end-matched. This method {{eliminates the need for}} <b>mitre</b> <b>joints,</b> face nailing, and the use of joints on [...] or [...] centres of conventional framing.|$|R
5000|$|... "W5" [...] {{was built}} in a small {{workshop}} with the simplest of tools, but displays an elegance of concept and design rarely seen {{in the history of}} the science. It was acclaimed by Jonathan Betts, the Senior Curator of Horology at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich as [...] "the nearest approach to perfection by any mechanical timekeeper not employing a vacuum chamber". Woodward built even the case, assembling it with intricate but invisible secret <b>mitre</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mitre 10 is an Australian {{retail and}} trade {{hardware}} store chain. Operations {{are based on}} a co-operative system where the store owners are members of the national group and each has voting rights. The chain name references the <b>mitre</b> <b>joint,</b> but was inspired by the Mitre Tavern in Melbourne. There are over 400 [...] "Mitre 10" [...] and its associated [...] "True Value Hardware" [...] franchises throughout Australia.|$|E
50|$|Coping is {{commonly}} used in the fitting of skirting and other mouldings in a room. It allows for clean joints between intersecting members when walls are not square to each other. The other method of fitting these mouldings that {{is commonly}} used is the <b>mitre</b> <b>joint</b> but this technique relies upon knowing the precise angle between the walls for neat results. Coping is only ever used for internal corners. External corners are always mitred.|$|E
50|$|A mason's mitre {{is a type}} of <b>mitre</b> <b>joint,</b> {{traditionally}} used in stonework or masonry but commonly seen in kitchen countertops. In a mason's mitre, the {{two elements}} being joined meet as for a butt joint but a small section of one member is removed creating a socket to receive the end of the other. A small mitre is made at the inside edges of the socket and {{on the end of the}} intersecting member so that edge treatments are carried through the joint appropriately.|$|E
50|$|Burt was {{approached}} by The Courtauld Gallery, London in January 2011 and commissioned to make benches throughout the rooms. He changed his approach incrementally to this commission to respond directly to the spaces and their differing collections (including major Impressionist paintings as well as highly elaborate 18th century furniture). Burt played on his theme of practical strength and understated line to create strong forms of a larger scale than hitherto using tigered oak. In these benches, as Burt remarks, ‘their bellied curves give a greater sensuality’ and the long grain legs have a <b>mitred</b> <b>joint</b> to the seats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{panel is}} {{constructed}} of two main vertical sections of wood of irregular width and joined with two inset butterfly joints. There are narrow horizontal sections of timber {{at the top}} and bottom of the panel. These sections have half-lapped <b>mitre</b> <b>joints</b> to the verticals, visible at the front of the panel. The rear of the panel has the words [...] "PINXIT MEA" [...] painted on it. It is written in Roman capital letters, in [...] "mirror writing" [...] so that the whole inscription is reversed and reads from left to right. The inscription runs down the left side of the reverse of the painting, rather than across it.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mitred</b> corner {{dovetail}} <b>joint</b> is {{very similar}} in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of the French stretcher, a <b>mitre</b> <b>joint</b> is used to adhere the corners. [...] "Keys" [...] or small {{triangle}} wedges are inserted in the joint after stretching the canvas to give the canvas its final tension. When fastening the canvas, pressure should be distributed evenly around the stretcher to minimize warping due to unequal distribution of pull. Unlike other types of stretchers, the corner joints in French stretchers are not glued or fastened in any permanent way. This allows the canvas to be re-tensioned later, as it has a natural tendency to stretch and sag over time. In contrast, strainer bars stretch canvas in a fixed (non-adjustable) way.|$|E
40|$|Most {{pieces of}} case {{furniture}} (kitchen and bathroom furniture, cabinets, wardrobes, tables and etc.) {{are made of}} 18  mm thick wood particle boards finished with various coatings. This three-layered constructional material is obtained by bonding wood particles of different fractions with synthetic resins using heating. The exploitation duration and quality of case furniture {{is determined by the}} mechanical properties of wood particle boards and the construction of joints of wood-based panels. On a frequent basis, pieces of case furniture with non-dismantable and dismantable construction are joined by using multidowel glued joints and cam connecting fittings intended for furniture, respectively. Wood-based panels can be joined with mitre joints whose mechanical properties have not undergone testing and comparison with regular joints when applying insertable wooden dowels or furniture connecting fittings. During the testing of particle board properties it was established that joining wood-based panels in this way ensures most efficient use of mechanical characteristics of the particleboard. In addition to the properties of the <b>mitre</b> <b>joint,</b> the tests also allowed determining the bending strength, tensile strength and bonding strength of the constructional material, and providing an original method for testing board properties, which can be successfully applied to the prediction of properties of the <b>mitre</b> <b>joint.</b> Tests were performed by using a universal tensile testing machine P- 0. 5. Joints were bonded by applying PVA dispersion. The surface of boards was veneered by using mahogany veneer and urea formaldehyde resin. It was found that mitre joints of wood particle boards can withstand loads that are higher from 2 to 4 times, in comparison to glued doweled joints or joints constructed with cam connecting fittings.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} impaction on the aerosolperformance of pharmaceutical powders comprising smooth and rough-surfaced spherical particles was investigated. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{was chosen as}} a model drug and powders prepared using spray drying. Surface roughness and adhesion force properties of BSA were measured by atomic force microscopy. The aerosolperformance of the powders was assessed by impaction using a customised throat model built with specific <b>mitre</b> <b>joints</b> (0, 15, 45 and 90 °), coupled with a liquid impinger through a laser diffractometer. Results showed enhanced aerosolperformance of BSA by mechanical impaction, with the effect increasing with the impaction angle and being more pronounced with corrugated BSA. This is attributed to the lower cohesion force between the corrugated particles, enabling them to de-agglomerate more readily on impaction. In conclusion, impaction causes significantly better deagglomeration in corrugated particles than smooth particles. A combination of mechanical impaction and rough surface will help maximise the aerosolperformance of powders for inhalation drug delivery...|$|R
50|$|The secret <b>mitred</b> {{dovetail}} <b>joint</b> (also {{called a}} mitred blind dovetail, full-blind dovetail, or full-blind mitred dovetail) {{is used in}} the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "back mitre" [...] and [...] "mason's mitre" [...] (or [...] "miter") {{are often}} used interchangeably, but are {{different}} types of joints, and used for different purposes. Both joints are traditionally used in stone or woodwork. Neither joint requires that one part be coped (or fit) over the other. In the back <b>mitre,</b> the <b>joints</b> follow the <b>mitre</b> and stile/rail joining lines. In the mason's mitre, the intersecting mouldings are carved within a single stone block or the woodwork's stile, with the rail or adjacent block having a straight profile.|$|R
50|$|A miter <b>joint</b> (<b>mitre</b> in British English), {{sometimes}} shortened to miter, {{is a joint}} made by beveling each of {{two parts}} to be joined, usually at a 45° angle, to form a corner, usually a 90° angle. For woodworking, a disadvantage of a miter joint is its weakness, {{but it can be}} strengthened with a spline. There are two common variations of a splined miter joint, one where the spline is long and runs the length of the mating surfaces and another where the spline is perpendicular to the joined edges.|$|R
40|$|Loss in {{transformer}} core is the electrical power lost {{in terms of}} heat within the core of transformer, when core is subjected to AC magnetizing force. It is composed of several types of losses such a s Hysterics loss, eddy current loss within individual laminations and inter-laminar losses that may arise if laminations are not sufficiently insulated from each other. To assess the level of no load loss relative to the occurrence of an inaccurate manufacturing of {{transformer core}}, a quantitative measure is often considered. The objective {{of this research is}} to study the magnetic behaviour of transformer core and compare the performance of building factor is comparable to the calculated values. Open circuit tests were conducted on 1000 KVA tranasformer with 90 degree T-joint and 45 degree <b>mitred</b> corners <b>joint</b> to determine the efficiency of hte transformer. The results showed that the building factor is useful index in assessing the impact on the core...|$|R
5000|$|The {{report of}} the court of inquiry was {{critical}} of {{the installation of the}} bypass pipework on a number of counts: although plant and senior management were chartered engineers (mostly chemical engineers) the post of Works Engineer which had been occupied by a chartered mechanical engineer had been vacant since January 1974 and {{at the time of the}} accident there were no professionally qualified engineers in the works engineering department. Nypro had recognised this to be a weakness and identified a senior mechanical engineer in an NCB subsidiary as available to provide advice and support if requested. At a meeting of plant and engineering managers to discuss the failure of Reactor 5, the external mechanical engineer was not present. The emphasis was upon prompt restart and - the inquiry felt - although this did not lead to the deliberate acceptance of hazards, it led to the adoption of a course of action whose hazards (and indeed engineering practicalities) were not adequately considered or understood. The major problem was thought to be getting reactor 5 moved out of the way. Only the plant engineer was concerned about restarting before the reason for the failure was understood, and the other reactors inspected. The difference in elevation between reactor 4 outlet and reactor 6 inlet was not recognised at the meeting. At a working level the offset was accommodated by a dog-leg in the bypass assembly; a section sloping downwards inserted between (and joined with by mitre welds) two horizontal lengths of 20-inch pipe abutting the existing 28-inch stubs. This bypass was supported by scaffolding fitted with supports provided to prevent the bellows having to take the weight of the pipework between them, but with no provision against other loadings. The Inquiry noted on the [...] "design" [...] of the assembly: No-one appreciated that the pressurised assembly would be subject to a turning moment imposing shear forces on the bellows for which they are not designed. Nor did anyone appreciate that the hydraulic thrust on the bellows (some 38 tonnes at working pressure) would tend to make the pipe buckle at the <b>mitre</b> <b>joints.</b> No calculations were done to ascertain whether the bellows or pipe would withstand these strains; no reference was made to the relevant British Standard, or any other accepted standard; no reference was made to the designer's guide issued by the manufacturers of the bellows; no drawing of the pipe was made, other than in chalk on the workshop floor; no pressure testing either of the pipe or the complete assembly was made before it was fitted.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{eddy current loss}} has done much {{research}} and this research is to study the influence of eddy current which cause higher energy loss at higher frequencies of magnetization. This paper is about analyses of eddy current loss in 100 kVA 3 phase distribution transformer assembled with the mix 60 °- 0 ° T-joint and <b>mitred</b> lap corner <b>joint</b> with stagger yoke of 5 mm. The loss has been measured using no load test with variable frequency. The eddy current loss rises to be 39. 1 % when the transformer core is energized at flux density of 1. 5 T and frequency of 55 Hz. increase of the frequency will cause the increase of power loss in the transformer core. It caused not all the flux flowing into the middle limb or other limb at difference instant in time of transformer core because there is still flux left {{in the area of}} butt-joint and the core loss that produced at the frequency more than 50 Hz will known as classical eddy current loss...|$|R
