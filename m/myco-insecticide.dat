40|$|The LUBILOSA (Lutte Biologique contre les Locusts et les Sauteriaux) Programme {{has been}} working on the {{development}} of a <b>myco-insecticide</b> for the control of locusts and grasshoppers for the past 9 years. The resulting <b>myco-insecticide</b> product (trade name Green MuscleTM) is based on an oil formulation of aerial conidia of the fungal entomopa-thogen, Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum. Field testing of this <b>myco-insecticide</b> in sou-thern Africa has been conducted in close collaboration with the Locust and Termite Research Division of the Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa. Trials have been conducted against Brown Locust, Locustana pardalina, in the Karoo region of South Africa and the Red Locust, Nomadacris septemfasciata, in the Buzi outbreak area of Moz-ambique. High (H 90 %) insect mortalities have been demonstrated following field appli-cations with standard ultra low volume (ULV) spraying equipment normally used in acridid control. Moreover, extensive eco-toxicological work has shown that Green MuscleTM has minimal impact on other non-target species, including other insects, reptiles, birds and mammals. Accordingly, Metarhizium has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Pesticide Referee Group for locust control in environmen-tally sensitive areas. Most significantly, Green MuscleTM has recently undergone successful registration for locust control in South Africa. This represents a fundamental breakthrough in locust control and creates, for the first time, real opportunities {{to move away from the}} use of chemicals towards more integrated control strategies incorporating biological con-trol techniques. This paper presents an overview of the progress of the LUBILOSA Pro-gramme and examines some of the research challenges that remain to fully implement this new technology in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{virulence}} {{of three}} strains of Beauveria bassiana {{and one of}} Metarhizium anisopliae was tested against Trialeurodes vaporariorum and its parasitoid Encarsia formosa in laboratory assays. These strains were previously selected for their virulence against Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor. The commercial B. bassiana strain ATCC 74040, both as pure fungal culture and formulated <b>myco-insecticide</b> (Naturalis), {{was included in the}} assays as positive control. First, the entomopathogenic fungal strains were tested for their virulence against T. vaporariorum nymphs on tomato leaf disks. Then, the E. formosa development was evaluated under treatment with the entomopathogenic fungal strains at five different time points from the parasitization of T. vaporariorum nymphs. The virulence of our entomopathogenic fungal strains was superior to that of ATCC 74040,although not significantly, resulting in a cumulative mortality (CM) of T. vaporariorum nymphs 7 days after inoculation (DAI) greater than 86 %. Our M. anisopliae strain CIST 8 was the most effective (96. 6 % CM 7 DAI), even superior to the <b>myco-insecticide</b> Naturalis (94. 2 %), which was more effective than the ATCC 74040 pure strain (85. 6 %). The entomopathogenic fungal strains, and especially Naturalis, negatively affected E. formosa development and its parasitization activity of T. vaporariorum nymphs. This effect was more pronounced when the fungal strains were applied before parasitization. Results suggest that the application of entomopathogenic fungi is incompatible with E. formosa release on crops...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, CMC {{at all the}} tested {{concentrations}} caused the highest mean radial growth (77.16  mm) with least inhibition percentage (8.03 %) after control (83.95  mm); it {{was found to be}} relatively less toxic to B. bassiana. Results of the growth inhibition of B. bassiana in the additives were in accordance with those of Tanuja et al. (2010) who stated that the negative impact of surfactants to microorganism was probably due to increased cell permeability and amino acid leakage through inner membrane. Formulation of <b>myco-insecticide</b> must be compatible with the agent and must enhance its performance and, ideally, must maintain an adequate shelf-life of the agent in order to be successful (Derakhshan et al. 2008).|$|E
