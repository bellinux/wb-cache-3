5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} <b>many</b> <b>White</b> players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, {{support of}} {{democratic}} socialism, {{and his former}} ties to the Communist Party USA caused <b>many</b> <b>white</b> and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin, which King agreed to do. However, King agreed that Rustin {{should be one of}} the main organizers of the 1963 March on Washington.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the <b>many</b> <b>white</b> men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a large}} Anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} in Washington {{during the early years}} of it being a territory and its statehood. Like in California, Chinese faced many discriminatory laws in Washington such as special taxes, prohibition against marrying whites, and owning land. <b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> viewed Chinese laborers as employment competitors. Even with the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, many Chinese laborers stayed in Washington. Because of this, <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> took this problem into their own hands.|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of <b>many</b> <b>white</b> males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|SASO decided after {{a debate}} to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's growth on various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for <b>many</b> <b>white</b> liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} fifty blue {{point-like}} {{objects in the}} HDF. Many seem {{to be associated with}} nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense star formation. Others may be distant quasars. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that <b>many</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.|$|E
50|$|And {{apart from}} the {{occasional}} bump up against reality, <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> could still pretend that the world they lived in was relatively safe, sound and perhaps even moral.|$|R
50|$|Sanders's {{work in the}} {{desegregation}} case {{made him}} the occasional target of hostile telephone calls and letters. He once said that Dallas was accustomed to segregation, and <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> were content with the status quo.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} Florida Constitution of 1885, white Democrats passed new constitutions in ten Southern states with {{provisions}} that restricted voter registration and forced {{hundreds of thousands}} of people from registration rolls. These changes effectively prevented most blacks and <b>many</b> poor <b>whites</b> from voting. <b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> who were also illiterate were exempted from such requirements as literacy tests by such strategies as the grandfather clause, basing eligibility on an ancestor's voting status as of 1866, for instance.|$|R
5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, <b>many</b> <b>white</b> middle-class residents {{moved out}} of the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, George and May {{toured the}} British Empire. Their tour {{included}} Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the Colony of Newfoundland. The tour {{was designed by}} Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain {{with the support of}} Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to reward the Dominions for their participation in the South African War of 1899–1902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. <b>Many</b> <b>white</b> Cape Afrikaners resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, <b>many</b> <b>white</b> Zimbabweans {{complained that}} they were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
50|$|Apartheid alienated all Indians as disenfranchised non-whites, and Hinduism in {{particular}} was perceived by <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> as antithetical to Christianity. The imposition of apartheid system also curtailed the opportunities for improvement and included the forced removals program, causing great disruption and social hardship.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> {{decided to}} emigrate to South Africa {{following}} a 1966 riot {{in which a}} European woman was killed. The mobs implicated in the attack believed that white saboteurs, supportive of Rhodesia, had caused a serious fire at the Kitwe oil depot.|$|R
50|$|Before his {{departure}} from a city, Dessalines would proclaim an amnesty {{for all the}} whites who had survived in hiding during the massacre. When these people left their hiding place, however, they were killed as well. <b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> were, however, hidden and smuggled out to sea by foreigners.|$|R
5|$|New {{research}} indicates that <b>many</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more pliable PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of <b>many</b> <b>white</b> workers for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections <b>many</b> <b>white</b> workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{influx of}} blacks into the North during the Great Migration {{of the early}} 20th century {{disturbed}} the racial balance within Northern cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and <b>white</b> Northerners. <b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward blacks, while <b>many</b> other <b>whites</b> migrated to more racially homogeneous regions, {{a process known as}} white flight. Overall, blacks in Northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Throughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings—mob-directed hangings—increased dramatically in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} and income-qualified franchise of the CAF was, therefore, now much looser. While this troubled <b>many</b> <b>whites,</b> {{they continued to}} follow Huggins with the CAF's current structure, largely owing to the economic growth. But to Africans, this increasingly proved unsatisfactory and their leaders began to voice demands for majority rule.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{era where}} <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> would not deal with blacks, Noah and his wife Elizabeth sold a tract of land in Floyd Co., on September 11, 1828 to Caesar Findley. [...] The Beauchamps resided in Illinois until the mid-1830s, when he {{relocated}} again to Indiana, this time to Vigo County.|$|R
25|$|By 1900, <b>many</b> <b>white</b> ministers, {{especially}} in the towns, subscribed to the Social Gospel movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day. Many strongly supported Prohibition, believing it would help alleviate and prevent many sins.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of centuries of having {{children}} with white people, the majority of African Americans have some European admixture, and <b>many</b> <b>white</b> people also have African ancestry. Robert P. Stuckert, member of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Ohio State University said {{that the majority of}} the descendants of African slaves are white.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, many freedmen moved from the farms into town. At the same time, <b>many</b> <b>white</b> citizens moved from town out to farms to avoid the occupying troops. The area took many years to recover from the disruption of the war years, continued reliance on agriculture, and shift to a free labor system.|$|E
50|$|In March 1909, Booker T. Washington, {{president}} of Tuskegee Institute {{and a national}} leader, spoke at Emanuel AME Church.

5000|$|... “…the South, as {{does the}} country, {{has a long way}} to go.

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that breakdowns of the European American population into sub-components is a difficult and rather arbitrary exercise. Farley (1991) argues that [...] "because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate respondents from their forebears and the apparent unimportance to <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent".|$|R
25|$|The medina (old town) of Tétouan {{is on the}} World Heritage List of the UNESCO. The {{inner city}} is very {{characteristic}} and traditional. One can find <b>many</b> <b>white</b> houses there, especially low houses. Everywhere in the city there are people performing their craftsmanship, like weavers, jewellers, leather workers. Street sellers often try to sell carpets to tourists as well.|$|E
25|$|As a {{personal}} friend of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, she was invited to <b>many</b> <b>White</b> House dinners, and in 1988, Reagan appointed her to the Federal Council on Aging. Allyson and her later husband, David Ashrow, actively supported fund-raising efforts for both the James Stewart and Judy Garland museums; both Stewart and Garland had been close friends.|$|E
25|$|As unrest {{spread to}} other parts of the city, many middle class white {{families}} who employed blacks in their homes as live-in cooks and servants were accosted by white rioters. They demanded that families turn over their employees to be taken to detention centers around the city. <b>Many</b> <b>white</b> families complied, and those who refused were subjected to attacks and vandalism in turn.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were other}} whites {{interested}} in so-called [...] "primitive" [...] cultures, as <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> viewed black American culture at that time, {{and wanted to}} see such [...] "primitivism" [...] in the work {{coming out of the}} Harlem Renaissance. As with most fads, some people may have been exploited in the rush for publicity.|$|R
50|$|From World War II {{through the}} 1960s, <b>many</b> <b>whites</b> {{who lived in}} this region (referred to by Charlestonians as the North Area) were unhappy about the way parts of their {{community}} were being developed. They wanted the citizens {{in the area to}} have direct control over future development. African Americans were still excluded from the political system due to the state's 1895 disfranchising constitution. <b>Many</b> of the <b>white</b> Democratic Party attempts to create an independent city were defeated via court rulings.|$|R
2500|$|The {{outcome of}} the fight {{triggered}} race riots that evening—the Fourth of July—all across the United States, from Texas and Colorado to New York and Washington, D.C. Johnson's victory over Jeffries had dashed white dreams of finding a [...] "great white hope" [...] to defeat him. <b>Many</b> <b>whites</b> felt humiliated by the defeat of Jeffries.|$|R
