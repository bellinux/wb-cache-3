50|$|Most {{automotive}} professionals {{agree that}} glycol-based brake fluid, (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5.1) should be flushed, or changed, every 1-2 years under non-racing conditions. Many manufacturers also require periodic fluid changes to ensure reliability and safety. Once installed, moisture diffuses into the fluid through brake hoses and rubber seals and, eventually, the fluid {{will have to}} be replaced when the water content becomes too high. Electronic testers and test strips are commercially available to measure moisture content, however <b>moisture</b> <b>test</b> strips were taken off the market because they absorb moisture in the air before they can be used. The corrosion inhibitors also degrade over time. Degraded inhibitors cause corrosion in the braking system. The first metal to corrode is copper. You can determine when it is time to replace brake fluid when copper ions hit 200ppm. New fluid should always be stored in a sealed container to avoid moisture intrusion.|$|E

The objective of this research was to develop accurate oven <b>moisture</b> <b>testing</b> methods for seeds of temperate grass species. The test variables investigated were oven temperature, time of drying, grinding the seed, and original moisture level of the seed. Chi-square analysis was used to determine if the results of the oven methods were within +̲ 0. 5 % of those obtained by the Karl Fischer reference method. The species included were perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis Huds.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.). Drying to constant weight at temperatures of 90, 100, and 105 °C gave moisture percentages lower than the true value. Drying periods of 6 h or less at 130 °C gave moisture percentages in agreement with Karl Fischer results. Ground and whole seed gave similar moisture percentages after drying to constant weight, but moisture was removed more rapidly from ground seeds.

In this flash flood event, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) produced over 340 mm of rain in roughly 9 hours in some locations. Two different types of model initialization were employed: 1) NCEP global reanalysis with 2. 5 -degree grid spacing and 12 -hour temporal resolution, and 2) Eta reanalysis with 40 - km grid spacing and $hour temporal resolution. In addition, two different land surface treatments were considered. A simple land scheme. (SLAB) keeps soil moisture fixed at initial values throughout the simulation, while a more sophisticated land model (PLACE) allows for r interactive feedback. Simulations with high-resolution Eta model initialization show considerable improvement in the intensity of precipitation due to the presence in the initialization of a residual mesoscale convective vortex (hlCV) from a previous MCS. Simulations with the PLACE land model show improved location of heavy precipitation. Since soil moisture can vary over time in the PLACE model, surface energy fluxes exhibit strong spatial gradients. These surface energy flux gradients help produce a strong low-level jet (LLJ) in the correct location. The LLJ then interacts with the cold outflow boundary of the MCS to produce new convective cells.

Tests were carried out on composite plates, which was a combination of sugar palm fiber and epoxy resins and two different fiber compositions have been chosen which were 10 % and 20 % by weight. Pure epoxy plates have been used for the control measures. The specimens were oven dried for 60 h in an air-circulating oven operated with 108 degrees C before being immersed in the constant temperature water bath, which the distilled water was set at 40 degrees C for the <b>moisture</b> absorption behavior <b>test</b> for 33 days. From this study, plates with 20 % fiber loading possessed the highest amount of moisture prior to the <b>moisture</b> absorption behavior <b>test,</b> which is 0. 93 %. In <b>moisture</b> absorption behavior <b>test,</b> the corrected value of Fickian diffusivity constant for the 20 % fiber loading is 3. 76 x 10 (- 7) mm(2) /s, which is the highest among other composites. It is shown that, for composite plates that contain higher fiber composition, the moisture absorption rate is even higher. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Several {{test methods}} exist for {{determining}} the water vapour permeability or resistance of textile fabrics or garments. The differences and interrelationships between these methods are not always clear, which presents a problem in comparing results from different test methods. This study is aimed at investigating {{the relationships between the}} test results from four typical test methods, including the <b>moisture</b> transmission <b>test</b> (Model CS- 141), ASTM E 96 cup method, sweating guarded hot plate method (ISO 11092) and the sweating fabric manikin (Walter). For the range of air permeable knitted fabrics tested, it was found that good interrelationships exist between the results from the four types of test methods, although some discrepancies exist between different tests due to differences in testing conditions. Test results from different <b>moisture</b> transfer <b>test</b> methods can therefore be convertible with due consideration. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the design of}} <b>moisture</b> <b>testing</b> system for ultra-dry granular material. It designs from software and hardware aspects in detail. In hardware design, humidity sensor of HM 1520 and data acquisition board of PXI- 6070 E are used; signal conversion between voltage and humidity is based on sensor circuit; PC is used to manage data acquisition and analysis. In software design, programming is based on LabVIEW 2011, it included five models such as DAQ, alarm value judgment, data saving, data querying, data printing etc. In system, the data acquisition is based on PXI bus. It is easy to operate data because of using the access database and LabSQL. The system has the following advantages: graphical editing language improving the programming speed, its interface is friendly for users to understand and operate because of visual interface...|$|R
