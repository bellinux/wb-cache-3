40|$|Studies of the European Union’s role {{in global}} policy {{negotiations}} typically focus either {{on international trade}} agreements, where the Community enjoys exclusive competence in negotiations, or on military and security accords, where member states take the diplomatic lead in international talks. Between these extremes {{are a number of}} issue negotiations in which Community officials and member state representatives speak jointly on behalf of the EU. We analyse one such ‘mixed competence’ case, the negotiations for a global Biosafety Protocol, to understand more about the EU’s behaviour and bargaining power in such settings. Rather than construct a new model for <b>mixed</b> <b>competence</b> cases, however, we aim for explanatory parsimony by applying an existing model designed to predict EU bargaining power in international trade negotiations (Meunier 2000). The analysis reveals that the trade model has considerable explanatory power for some of the outcomes found in the Biosafety Protocol negotiations, but incorrectly predicts that the EU will have no bargaining power. We then identify the sources of discrepancy between the model’s predictions and our empirical results to pinpoint the key differences between exclusive and <b>mixed</b> <b>competence</b> negotiations. We conclude the article by making suggestions for future model building and by reflecting on changes in the new Constitutional Treaty that may affect the EU’s bargaining power on the global stage. The paper is structured as follows. First, we briefly review the literature on the EU in global negotiations before presenting the key parameters and predictions of the Meunier model. Second, we demonstrate the differences between ‘exclusive’ and ‘mixed’ negotiation competences in the EU, and highlight environmental policy negotiations {{as an example of the}} latter. Third, we test the predictions of the Meunier model against the case of the Biosafety Protocol negotiations. While the model predicts no bargaining power for the EU in this type of case, we show, against expectations, the EU was a tough bargainer and achieved virtually all of its aims in the final agreement. Fourth, we discuss the potential sources of this discrepancy in the Meunier model and offer suggestions for future model building. The conclusion summarizes the paper and highlights several trends that may affect the EU’s behavior in forthcoming international negotiations...|$|E

40|$|The Lisbon Treaty extends {{exclusive}} European Union {{competence to}} {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). After a transition period this should enable the EU to conclude either international investment agreements or comprehensive trade and investment agreements with third parties. This extension of the EU’s competence offers the opportunity of promoting EU competitiveness in global markets through increased investment and better access to key third country markets. It also facilitates a greater European influence over international investment agreements a key instrument in any response to globalisation. The EU will {{need to develop a}} coherent and balanced approach to investment if it is {{to make the most of}} these opportunities. In this the EU needs to address four major issues. First, the treaty provides no definition of FDI and thus the scope of EU exclusive competence. The EU institutions must therefore work towards a consensus on the scope of competence or how to manage <b>mixed</b> <b>competence</b> negotiations. Second, there is a need to define the main elements of an EU investment policy. This will involve agreement on standards for investment protection, dispute settlement and arbitral procedures as well as what the EU aims should be in terms of promoting ‘sustainable investment. ’ Third, it will be necessary to decide on the basis of clear and objective criteria, which third countries should be given priority when it comes to negotiating EU level investment agreements. Finally, agreement must be found on how to manage the transition from member state bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to EU level investment agreements.

40|$|Both the European Community (EC) and its Member States {{agree that}} it is in their best {{interest}} to coordinate their action vis-a-vis {{the rest of the world}} in international agreements. This dissertation examines the law and practice of the EC external trade relations. The major point of analysis is to find ways to ensure the unitary character of the EC external trade relations in areas of <b>mixed</b> <b>competence</b> between EC Member States and EC Institutions as well as understand the management of the EC external trade relations. It begins with an analysis of the evolution of the EC common commercial policy, through which the author examines the checks and balances at the micro, meso and macro levels. The major EC Institutions are examined: the Commission as the negotiator of international agreements, the EU Council as the consultator and concluder of agreements, the European Parliament in its role of consultator and the role of the European Court of Justice in relation to shared competence between the EC and its Member States in the framework of international trade. The decision making process of the EU and its relation with national institutions are analyzed as an important part of this dissertation. The legal complexity of mixity is then analyzed. This unique legal phenomenon (mixed agreements) is tackled from an intra-EC perspective as well as from its external dimension, where its various implications for third parties are taken into account. This dissertation concludes that although the European Union is composed of 15 sovereign Member States with unique needs and circumstances, in most cases it is in their national interest to give up their national sovereignty to the European level to have a stronger negotiating position in international negotiations. This would only be legally possible by amending the Treaties...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{theories}} of European integration have focussed {{on the internal}} dynamics of this unique form of international cooperation. This also holds for the principal-agent approach, a newer and more sophisticated methodology. This thesis argues that this approach's frame of reference needs to be broadened in order to offer a more coherent framework since the European Community is becoming an increasingly active player on the international stage. Consequently, the inward-looking bias in integration theory needs to be overcome {{to come to a}} better understanding of the development of the external role and position of the Commission. Through the analysis of case studies, the study of primary and secondary sources and interviews with policy-makers, this thesis shows that the external institutional framework impacts on Commission-Member States relations, and thus on the process of European integration. Within the strong institutional framework of the World Trade Organisation, the Commission has more leeway vis-a-vis the Member States to gain influence and competences. Through its central role in the WTO's dispute settlement system, the Commission has managed to gain broader competences concerning trade- related aspects of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Commission is a firm proponent of the strengthening of the dispute settlement system. It is actively trying to incorporate new issues of <b>mixed</b> <b>competence,</b> like investment, within this strong institutional framework in the hope of improving its position. This is not restricted to trade-issues either. Also in international environmental agreements, the Commission tries to strengthen its position by pushing for stronger institutional provisions and for the incorporation of environmental concerns within the WTO framework. The interaction between the European and the international level, and its impact on Commission-Member State relations necessitate complementing the principal-agent approach to make it more outward-looking so that it can also be used to study the external aspects of European integration...|$|E
40|$|To {{conserve}} {{the maritime}} access channels to the Belgian coastal harbours {{and to maintain}} {{the depth of the}} Flemish coastal harbours dredging is needed (Flemish competence) in order to guarantee safe maritime transport. A distinction is being made between maintenance and capital dredging. Maintenance dredging is the periodical removal of material, typically sand and silt deposited by nature through river flow, tidal currents or wave action in areas previously dredged. Capital dredging is the initial deepening of an area such as a channel, harbour or berthing facility, but can also include excavation of underwater trenches for cables, pipelines, tunnels and other civil engineering works. The total volume of dredged material which can be more or less contaminated is being dumped at sea. The competence for dumping at sea falls under the federal government. Therefore, the management of dredged material in Belgium is a <b>mixed</b> <b>competence.</b> On the 12 th of June 1990, a cooperation agreement was signed between {{the federal government and the}} Flemish region, amended by the cooperation agreement of the 6 th of September 2000. Dumping at sea of dredged material is carried out in accordance with the federal law of 20 th January 1999 and a permit is given in accordance with the procedure defined in the royal decree of 12 th of March 2000. Corresponding to article 10 of this procedure a “synthesis report” has to be established for the Minister which has the North Sea under his competences. The synthesis report needs to include recommendations which support the development of an enforced environmental management. The Flemish Government divided her authority into thirteen Policy Councils. By Decree of the Flemish Government of 7 th October 2005, it was decided that the Maritime Access Division should become the implementing division within the Department under the Policy Council of the Flemish Minister for Public Works. In the same Decree the Flemish Government decided to install the Agency for Maritime Services and Coast. The decision was implemented on 1 st April 2006. The Maritime Access Division maintains all maritime access channels to the Flemish ports of Oostende, Zeebrugge, Gent and Antwerpen. The Coast Division of the Agency for Maritime Services and Coast maintains the Flemish Coastal Marinas of Nieuwpoort, Oostende, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge. The international framework for dumping at sea of dredged material is the (regional) OSPAR Convention (1992) and the (worldwide) London Convention (1972) and Protocol (1996). These conventions and their associated guidelines take into account the presence of any contaminants within the sediment and whether some alternative beneficial use is possible. In implementing these guidelines, e. g. action levels (sediment quality criteria) have to be defined, dumping sites have to be chosen and a permanent monitoring and research programme has to be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Proposes that, in {{the chaotic}} {{organizational}} environments of the 1990 s, managers {{must be able}} to design winning competitive paradigms and then change these continuously and sometimes discontinuously if their organization is at least to stay crisis-averse and ideally grow and prosper. Indicates that to achieve this they must understand their environment and the keys to a successful and sustained match - this requires that they stay aware and think strategically. States that awareness and thinking implies learning and sharing information - both inside the organization and with important stakeholders and influencers. To this end, managers must realize just what information is important and how to deal with it. Reports that the important information relates to those specific organizational competences which, unique to the individual organization, are critical for their current and future competitive and strategic success. Driven by the strategic leader organizations must, therefore, first, establish their unique <b>mix</b> of <b>competences.</b> Second, they must ensure attention is focused on these competences - rather than others which are less important for adding value - and that this attention fosters improvement. Third, these improvements must be measured. In addition organizations must, over time, develop (internally) or acquire (by buying in) new competences. Concludes that research indicates that learning and competence development along these lines is not happening widely...|$|R

40|$|According to {{traditional}} {{perspectives on the}} 'flexible firm' ([Atkinson, 1984]) as well as influential theories {{in the field of}} strategic management (TCE, RBV), non-standard work arrangements should be used in the peripheral areas of the firm's value creation processes.

In a survey of 26 Norwegian firms in computer services, this proposition receives empirical support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{contribute}} to the corporate governance literature by establishing the relationship between board characteristics and corporate performance within the nonlife insurance firms in Zimbabwe. The study sought to provide some insights on corporate governance since the phenomenon is relatively an emerging discipline in Zimbabwe. The paper sought to complement other corporate governance studies that were conducted in other environments by producing evidence on the phenomenon from a developing country context. A quantitative research approach was adopted and respondents were selected through a stratified random sampling. The results of the study confirm that board characteristics (board composition, diversity, and size) exhibit a statistically significant positive predictive relationship with the performance of non-life insurance firms measured by gross premium written and customer retention. However, CEO/Chairman duality showed a negative relationship with business performance. Non-life insurance companies need to be cognizant of board characteristics in order to improve their performance. Moreover, the findings in this research has practical relevance for the selection process of directors as it highlights the importance of having a sizeable number of board members as well as an appropriate <b>mix</b> of <b>competences</b> and qualifications on the board. Although corporate governance is has been extensively researched, there is limited study in this area from a developing country like Zimbabwe with relatively less developed capital markets.

Moreover, the EEAS is contributing to the expansion of the existing practice of foreign policy communications in three ways. First, it has affected the direction of communication flows in the most well-established (but now declining) communication system - the COREU/CORTESY network - as a growing proportion of messages now originate in Brussels. Second, the EEAS is developing an autonomous EU capacity for information gathering, as EU delegations regularly draft political reports.

40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, a series of {{contractors}} operating in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have slowly but surely expanded their markets beyond their previous single-country base towards operating in Scandinavia as a whole, and beyond. This expansion {{has been accompanied by}} a restructuring of company organisations and associated processes of competency development in senior management. This paper asks the question: How well is top level management prepared to manage and lead these large companies? The paper adopts a multidisciplinary theoretical approach combining international business, strategic management and HR concepts and approaches. Methodologically, a sample of the top level leaders of the hundred largest business units at some thirty Scandinavian contractors has been analysed. The focus is on the 400 top level managers in these organisations. On the basis of a desk study, an analysis of 124 managers from 18 companies has been carried out, providing insight into the basic education and <b>mixing</b> of <b>competences</b> in the top-level boards. More specifically, the areas of operations strategy and IT have been reviewed. The results show that even if the board is mainly composed of engineering competencies, business, legal and HR competencies are also present. Both engineer-dominated and mixed management boards are heading companies which show growth in turnover. This runs counter to a widespread sector perception that management boards in the construction industry are mainly composed of engineers. However, it seems that the managers with business administration competencies are rarely those with responsibility for the central tasks of leadership and strategy. Moreover, very few companies prioritize operations strategy and IT. It is assumed that everybody knows about practical building projects, and therefore that operations strategy will develop naturally. The IT area is viewed as best placed at a lower level of organisation, counter to IT governance and management prescriptions...|$|R

Renton starts a recovery program and gets finally clean. He starts a job in London but looses it, because his former friends visit him and get him into trouble at his work.

Scene: heroin male adults hard drugs Transgressive solitary 0 : 43 : 27 - 0 : 45 : 02 In this scene Renton uses heroine. The dealer is offering him his needle like a waiter in a noble restaurant. The injection itself is shown very clearly and the audience can see how the needle gets into the vein. Discussion: The presentation {{of the use of}} the needle will cause critical reaction of the audience. On the other side the offer for the needle seems very chic. Hence this is also a kind of positive picture of drug consumption. It is not like the stereotypic image of addicts using needles several times or even sharing them. Clip: 31 (Addictions 4) Notes: PS: 2007 - 08 - 13 : Five male friends use heroin, some girls are involved too. The main character wants to quit, makes an attempt. The beginning scene where he dives into the toilet seat is really disgusting. The rest of the scenes, of which there are very many, are less bad. Withdrawals are described as more terrifying than anything you could imagine in the old Hollywood alcoholism films with DT etc. Parents help, he starts a career in real estate in London. His friends get a 1 kg load of heroin; need his competence to test it (danger!!!!) but no problem. They sell if for big money, they party in a pub, get drunk and he takes all the money, leaving some to the most sympathetic guy. There is very little to explain the title of the film and I missed it.
