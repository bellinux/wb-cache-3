[...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{was already}} an {{accomplished}} frontiersman, horseman and guerrilla fighter. In {{addition to his}} native Dutch he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion {{for the first time}} when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions he was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly-killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> already easier and the danger much less." [...] The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again.|$|E

[...] Plant's own explanation of the lyrics was that it [...] "was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand ... and it softened up after that.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Miller {{worried that}} lawyers for The Simpsons {{would try to}} stop him from {{performing}} the play. At the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the cast members of the television series were performing a special reading of dialog that featured their characters. When the producers found out that Miller was also at the festival, they invited him to a cast party. There he met The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, who had previously seen a video of MacHomer. According to Miller, [...] "next thing I knew, Matt Groening was shaking <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>was</b> giving me his blessing and was telling me he'd do all he could to help me continue my show. It's the best situation I could have dreamed of. No one is suing me, or asking for royalties, either." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} I was standing in front of him. In <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E

I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
