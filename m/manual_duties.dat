40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the e-readiness of warehouse workers in a supply chain management environment. Organisations increasingly contemplate e-learning as a training option to develop their employees. Globalisation of commercial ventures increasingly demands that organisations become more competitive by introducing Information Technology (IT). e-Learning is seen as a stepping stone for empowering employees. Supply-chain management organisations use unskilled warehouse workers to perform <b>manual</b> <b>duties</b> such as registering, storing and quick location of stock for distribution. IT supports these logistic procedures – emphasising the need to introduce e-learning to warehouse workers. Questionnaires confirmed that the unit of analysis was multi-racial, mostly black, between eighteen and sixty years old and of both genders. Their limited educational qualifications are representative of many similar developing communities of work across Africa. e-Learning requires access to technology, computer literacy, self-discipline, the drive to develop and the confidence to use technology to achieve objectives. Warehouse workers as developing communities are trapped by the digital divide amidst calls to bridge the divide by introducing IT to such communities. Questions are raised whether they have the discipline, motivation, and skills to learn from such a complex learning strategy. Interviewed corporate learning experts cautioned that specific infrastructures and personal attributes are crucial. Insufficient computer experience, anxiety and technophobia, may cause warehouse workers to become unlikely candidates for e-learning. My inquiry was an interpretive, qualitative case study, intent on understanding emotional, technical, and social aspects influencing e-readiness. I collected my data in four phases. Phase one was a questionnaire to collect biographical information of the warehouse workers. During phase two, by means of a Delphi technique, I established consensus from a group of e-learning experts of what ereadiness encompasses. Phase three consisted of interviews with and observations of workers performing their daily tasks and also while completing a computer-based tutorial. In phase four I conducted interviews with warehouse managers on their perceptions of the e-readiness of their workers. From the literature I extracted Reeves’ (1999) three learner inputs, as well as six fundamental categories of e-readiness. With these nine theory codes, I followed an inductive-deductive grounded theory approach to analyse the data. I constructed six sub-questions as basis for the enquiry. I tallied the frequencies of the conceptual codes of e-readiness and created an inventory of applicable conceptual codes according to the theory codes. Patterns of technical and affective experience, aptitude, origins of motivation, access to computer infrastructure and organisation culture culminated as my seven main findings on the e-readiness of warehouse workers. I determined inter alia that warehouse workers do not suffer from technophobia, nor are they really intimidated by technology. However, they need guidance and expert facilitation to become successful e-learners. They are aware that they are dependent on the organisation’s infrastructure to develop their skills and capabilities. Therefore, the e-maturity of an organisation can greatly benefit from warehouse workers’ involvement in e-learning. Thesis (PhD (Curriculum Studies)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

[...] "For the sins of these few," [...] he wrote, [...] "a sentence of banishment was visited upon the whole tribe. They were far from deserving it." [...] After serving as aide to General George Crook upon his death in 1890, Kennon began service with the US Army Corps of Engineers, being sent to Central America in 1891 as engineer to survey a possible route for an inter-oceanic canal. While there, he surveyed Mexico's border with Guatemala, eventually carrying the survey around Guatemala until it reached the Nicaraguan border.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Dairy {{farming is}} a {{physically}} demanding occupation, however, {{little is known}} about the physical demands of dairy farming tasks, other than milking. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of musculoskeletal discomfort experienced by dairy farmers in relation to their work. Methods/Participants: A total of 433 dairy farmers from two Australian states (NSW and Victoria) were invited to participate in a mail-out survey (21 % response rate, N = 90), which covered musculoskeletal discomfort, physical workload, task frequency and muscular recovery time. Results: Farmers perceived that routine tasks performed repetitively caused more musculoskeletal discomfort than heavier tasks performed on a non-routine or seasonal basis. Males were more likely to perform heavier <b>manual</b> handling <b>duties</b> and tasks involving the use of machinery, whereas females performed more routine administration work. Both men and women were exposed to similar physical demands from the performance of a number of commonly reported and strenuous tasks. Reduced income, lack of stafﬁng, deregulation, and insufﬁcient recovery time were key factors identiﬁed by farmers to directly or indirectly limit the reduction of musculoskeletal discomfort at work. Conclusion: Dairy farming is a diversiﬁed occupation that requires physical demands from both male and female workers. Further research is needed to investigate speciﬁc task demands and identify possible risk factors that may contribute to the future development of musculoskeletal disorders...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to find out}} if it's {{feasible}} to use on/off solenoid valves and pneumatic actuators to operate heavy <b>duty</b> <b>manual</b> transmissions. The shift and select operations in the transmission will be position controlled to reduce wear and tear. The on/off solenoid valves are more complicated to control than proportional valves, but are cheaper, smaller and more robust. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of automotive industry. This lead to limiting sensory inputs to only a position sensor for each of the two actuators. The gear change dynamics of a heavy duty transmission with the added pneumatics was modeled in MATLAB-Simulink. This enabled the development of a gain scheduled controller for the system. The pneumatics and control system was then implemented in a test rig consisting of a transmission driven by an electric motor, and the results were compared to those of the simulations. The results show that full gear changes with both shift and select actuation can be done in under 350 ms, and that the model replicates the dynamics in a realistic manner. It was found that one should implement RPM-matching in the system. This would lead to less wear and tear on the transmission, lower shift times and higher consistency in shift times. These results show that the use of on/off solenoid valves are a feasible choice of control method for the system. </p...|$|R
