40|$|Multimedia {{applications}} place new {{requirements on}} networks {{as compared to}} traditional data applications: (i) they require relatively high bandwidths on a continuous basis {{for long periods of}} time; (ii) involve <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications</b> and thus are expected to make heavy use of multicasting; and (iii) tend to be interactive and thus require low latency. These requirements {{must be taken into account}} when routing multimedia traffic in a network. This report presents a performance evaluation of routing algorithms in the multimedia environment, where the requirements of <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications,</b> bandwidth and latency must be satisfied. We present an exact solution to the optimum multicast routing problem, based on integer programming, and use this solution as a benchmark to evaluate existing heuristic algorithms, considering both performance and cost of implementation (as measured by the average run time), under realistic network and traffic scenarios...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} recent {{findings}} related to safety-critical V 2 V <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications</b> in ad hoc networks of fully automated vehicles, {{in the presence}} of communication failures. Neither classical failure assumptions nor multipoint protocols at the core of existing communication standards can be considered, since they do not meet the high reliability and strict timeliness requirements set for safety-critical scenarios. We introduce a novel unbounded omission failure model, the concept of proxy sets which builds on the cohort construct, and Zebra, a suite of geocast, convergecast, and multicast protocols specifically designed for safety-critical 1 -hop <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications.</b> Analytical expressions of worst-case termination time bounds are given for each Zebra protocol, which is mandatory with safety requirements. These results have a number of practical implications, which are discussed. They should be of interest to safety authorities and to the transportation industry involved in future deployments of intelligent vehicular networks...|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} {{method is}} considered {{that allows the}} reduction of traffic and transportation costs when non-consumable goods are transported from a single source to multiple destinations through a point-to-point transportation network. The savings {{are based on the}} principle that joint sections of paths to different destination are found and exploited to the utmost. The main emphasis is given upon <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications</b> in global networks which consist of a huge number of nodes and connections between them. Since the global information about the network is not available in single nodes as it is required by the wellknown algorithms for the construction of minimal spanning trees and Steiner trees, the appropriate distributed algorithms have been developed for both instances. Simulation results have shown that the communication costs are halved with respect to standard solutions when multicast connections are used for <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications.</b> Keywords: multidestination transportation [...] ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION During the late- 1990 s, the {{popularity}} of Internet applications like B 2 C (business-to-consumer) e-commerce and web-browsing led traditional network operators to seek ways which allowed their customers to access these new services. Today (2002), IP-based packet switching technology has finally matured enough to replace the circuit-switched backbones of telecommunication carriers. Convergence on the IP protocol is now happening and {{it will continue to}} happen throughout this decade. It is obvious that this one common protocol will ease the management of all wired and wireless data networks. IP will also fuel the deployment of novel applications. An important feature these applications will expect from an allIP internetwork is full support for <b>multipoint</b> <b>communications.</b> <b>Multipoint,</b> or group, <b>communications</b> are best described by the term multicast, a term associated with network support for efficient data delivery to more than one interested recipients.
