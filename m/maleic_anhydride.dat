25|$|Radicals attack double bonds. However, unlike similar ions, such radical {{reactions}} {{are not as}} much directed by electrostatic interactions. For example, the reactivity of nucleophilic ions with α,β-unsaturated compounds (C=C–C=O) is directed by the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen, resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. There are two reactions that are observed in the ionic case: the carbonyl is attacked in a direct addition to carbonyl, or the vinyl is attacked in conjugate addition, and in either case, the charge on the nucleophile is taken by the oxygen. Radicals add rapidly to the double bond, and the resulting α-radical carbonyl is relatively stable; it can couple with another molecule or be oxidized. Nonetheless, the electrophilic/neutrophilic character of radicals {{has been shown in}} a variety of instances. One example is the alternating tendency of the copolymerization of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (electrophilic) and styrene (slightly nucleophilic).|$|E

For the patients sensitized to TCPA and TMA, RAST inhibition studies demonstrate the anhydride-HSA conjugate to be a more effective inhibitor of RAST than the sodium salt of the anhydride or an anhydride-bovine serum albumin conjugate, whereas for those sensitized to PA, the free hapten is almost as an effective inhibitor as the conjugate. With each sera HSA conjugates of anhydrides to which the patient is not sensitized are weaker inhibitors than the sensitizing anhydride-albumin conjugate. These results provide strong evidence that for the patients sensitized to TCPA and TMA, the antibody combines with the anhydride and the spatially adjacent portion of the HSA molecule, whereas in the patients sensitized to PA, the antibody is specific for the hapten...|$|R
40|$|Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) {{production}} in air masses containing either anthropogenic or biogenic (terpene-dominated) emissions is investigated using the explicit gas-phase chemical mechanism generator GECKO-A. Simulations show several-fold increases in SOA mass continuing for multiple {{days in the}} urban outflow, even as the initial air parcel is diluted into the regional atmosphere. The SOA mass increase in the forest outflow is more modest (~ 50 %) and of shorter duration (1 – 2 days). The multiday {{production in}} the urban outflow stems from continuing oxidation of gas-phase precursors which persist in equilibrium with the particle phase, and {{can be attributed to}} multigenerational reaction products of both aromatics and alkanes, especially those with relatively low carbon numbers (C 4 – 15). In particular we find large contributions from substituted <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> and multi-substituted peroxide-bicyclic alkenes. The results show that the predicted production is a robust feature of our model even under changing atmospheric conditions and different vapor pressure schemes, and contradict the notion that SOA undergoes little mass production beyond a short initial formation period. The results imply that anthropogenic aerosol precursors could influence the chemical and radiative characteristics of the atmosphere over an extremely wide region, and that SOA measurements near precursor sources may routinely underestimate this influence...|$|R

40|$|Pretreatment of sarcoplasmic {{membranes}} with acetic or <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydrides,</b> which interact principally with amino groups, {{resulted in}} an inhibition of Ca 2 + accumulation and ATPase activity. The presence of ATP, ADP or adenosine 5 '-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate in the modification medium selectively protected against the inactivation of ATPase activity by the anhydride but did not protect against the inhibition of Ca 2 + accumulation. Acetic anhydride modification {{in the presence of}} ATP appeared to increase specifically the permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane to Ca 2 + but not to sucrose, Tris, Na+ or Pi. The chemical modification stimulated a rapid release of Ca 2 + from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles passively or actively loaded with calcium, from liposomes reconstituted with the partially purified ATPase fraction but not from those reconstituted with the purified ATPase. The inactivation of Ca 2 + accumulation by acetic anhydride (in the presence of ATP) was rapid and strongly pH-dependent with an estimated pK value above 8. 3 for the reactive group(s). The negatively charged reagents pyridoxal 5 -phosphate and trinitrobenzene-sulphonate, which also interact with amino groups, did not stimulate Ca 2 + release.

Cultures grown on sulphosuccinate were able to convert this substrate to sulphite which was subsequently oxidized rapidly to sulphate. The sequence of desulphonation and carbon-chain catabolism of sulphosuccinate was determined from measurements of the kinetics of sulphite and 14 C 0, release from specifically radiolabelled sulpho[l, 4 - 14 C]succinate and sulpho[2, 3 - 14 C]~~~~inate, which were synthesized from the corresponding <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydrides.</b> When each radiolabelled compound was incubated separately with washed-cell suspensions of Pseudomonas BSI, sulphite was released before 14 C 02, as shown by chemical assay and radiorespirometry, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: Surfactant {{proteins}} A, B, C and D complex with (phospho) lipids {{to produce}} surfactants which provide low interfacial tensions.

Synthetic protein-phospholipid complexes, with styrene <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> (SMAs) as the protein analogue, {{have been shown to}} have similarly low surface tensions. This study investigates the potential of modified SMAs and/or SMA-phospholipid complexes, which form under physiological conditions, to supplement natural tear film surfactants. Method: SMAs were modified to provide structural variants which can form complexes under varying conditions. Infrared spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance were used to confirm SMA structure. Interfacial behaviour of the SMA and SMA-phospholipid complexes was studied using Langmuir trough, du Nûoy ring and pulsating bubblemethods. Factors which affect SMA-phospholipid complex formation, such as temperature and pH, were also investigated. Results: Structural manipulation of SMAs allows control over complex formation, including under physiological conditions (e. g. partial SMAesterfication allowed complexation with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, at pH 7). The low surface tensions of the SMAs (42 mN/m for static (du Nûoy ring) and 34 mN/m for dynamic (Langmuir) techniques) demonstrate their surface activity at the air-aqueous interface. SMA-phospholipid complexes provide even lower surface tensions (~ 2 mN/m), approaching that of lung surfactant, as measured by the pulsating bubblemethod. Conclusions: Design of the molecular architecture of SMAs allows control over their surfactant properties. These SMAs could be used as novel tear films supplements, either alone to complex with native tear film phospholipids or delivered as synthetic protein-phospholipid complexes...|$|R
