500|$|Rather than {{utilizing}} makeup tactics, such as {{the ones}} used in A Beautiful Mind, to give Jeff Bridges a younger appearance, the character of Clu was completely computer generated. To show that this version of Clu was created some time after the events of the original film, the visual effects artists based his appearance on how Bridges looked in Against All Odds, released two years after Tron. The effects team hired makeup artist Rick Baker to construct a molded likeness of a younger Bridges head to serve as their basis for their CG work. But soon, they scrapped the mould because they wished for it to be more youthful. There was no time to make another mould, so the team reconstructed it digitally. On-set, first Bridges would perform, being then followed by stunt double John Reardon who would mimic his actions. Reardon's head was replaced on post-production with the digital version of the young Bridges. Barba – who was involved in a similar experience for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button — stated that they used four <b>microcameras</b> with infrared sensors to capture all 134 dots on Bridges face that would be the basis of the facial movements, a similar process that was used in Avatar.

40|$|Discovered in 1993 [1], the {{so-called}} ”uomo di Altamura” {{is a rare}} example of a rather complete non-modern human skeleton {{and one of the}} most amazing paleoanthropological specimen ever found in Europe. It represents a massive adult male Neanderthal with some peculiarities in its morphology and a very ancient age, ranging between 128 and 187 ka [2]. The preservation of the skeleton is exceptional, although largely incorporated within calcite concretions. In the last years, we started a thorough monitoring program, paired with a laser scanner acquisition and high-resolution photogrammetry of the cave, as well as of the skeletal elements emerging from the karst. Here we present the digital reconstruction of the cranium of the Altamura skeleton partially covered by concretions, virtually extracted from the whole matrix of our digital data. The superficial morphology of the cranium was digitally acquired in two steps, using different methodologies, given that the anterior components of the cranium are directly visible together with other bones of the skeleton, whereas many posterior and basal components are accessible only by techniques inspired to endoscopic surgery. The anterior components – most of the facial bones, the almost entire frontal bone, part of the right temporal and parietal bones, the labial and occlusal surface of the anterior dentition – were acquired with a high-resolution laser scanner (40 μm). By contrast, the posterior components – the occipital bone, large portions of the right parietal and of both temporal bones, the lower portions of the facial bones, and other elements of the cranial base – were acquired by technique of photogrammetry using HD <b>microcameras.</b> The images were processed using the software Agisoft Photoscan. The two large digital surfaces (halves) have in common the incisal edge of the anterior dentition; this allowed us to combine the two halves and adjust the mid-sagittal profile of the braincase appropriately. By means of Geometric Morphometrics, we have used 38 comparative Midto- Late Pleistocene Homo specimens (including Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis) and modern humans. The two halves of the Altamura cranium were aligned on a scaled and symmetrized version of a reference model. Using a landmark-based approach (performed separately for the anterior and posterior components), the best-fitting Neanderthal specimen for this purpose resulted to be Saccopastore 1. We have then warped the morphology of the reference specimen with dedicated software to fulfil the missing portions of the aligned two halves of Altamura. This was done in combination with mirrored part of Altamura itself; particularly, the left zygomatic process of the temporal bone, part of the right zygomatic bone and part of the lateral wall of the right parietal bone were digitally mirrored and repositioned on the corresponding missing portions on the opposite side. The complete and detailed protocol is described by Profico et al [3]. The digital reconstruction of the Altamura cranium is now suitable for morphological observations and some morphometric analyses. Among the visible features there are many traits that detach this specimen from the Neanderthal morphology. For instance, the facial districts display an advanced degree of midfacial prognathism with inflated maxillary sinuses, but the vault appears more plesiomorphic than the face: particularly the parietals are angulated in coronal section, while the mastoids are big and projecting downward. At the same time, while the occipital appears definitely Neanderthal-like in many respects – including a double-arched occipital torus and a well defined suprainiac fossa – the brow-ridges do not seem typical for a Neanderthal, since each supraorbital region (despite largely obscured by concretions) appears massive, with a marked distinction between medial and lateral aspects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Extremely {{low birth}} weight (ELBW) infants {{frequently}} require endotracheal intubation for assisted ventilation or as a route for admin-istration of drugs or exogenous surfactant. In adults and less premature infants, the risks of this intubation can be greatly reduced using video laryngoscopy, but current products are too large and incorrectly shaped to visualize an ELBW infant’s airway anatomy. We design and prototype a video laryngoscope using a miniature camera set in a curved acrylic blade with a 3 × 6 -mm cross section at the tip. The blade provides a me-chanical structure for stabilizing the tongue and acts as a light guide for an LED light source, located remotely to avoid excessive local heating at the tip. The prototype is tested on an infant manikin and found to provide sufficient image quality and mechanical properties to facilitate intubation. Finally, we show a design for a neonate laryngoscope in-corporating a wafer-level <b>microcamera</b> that further reduces the tip cross section and offers the potential for low cost manufacture.

Materials and Methods: A regular cystoscope, and a 10 mm 0 -degree laparoscope were used. Each was attached to a different <b>microcamera</b> and light source. the cameras were hooked to the back of a Twinvideo (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany), allowing a wide variety of views combining the 2 images. Cystoscopy was performed as usual and the laparoscope was used for vaginoscopy with a transparent vaginal speculum to maintain the vagina open, while allowing visualization of the vaginal wall. the 2 images were combined in picture in picture, providing confidence during the fistula identification process. Urinary leakage was viewed simultaneously with guide wire passage through the cystoscope and vaginal wall, showing the exactly fistula position. Results: the CVC procedure using 2 images in picture in picture allows precise identification during evaluation for vesicovaginal fistula. Conclusions: CVC has become a routine procedure in suspicious cases or in those of a confirmed diagnosis of vesicovaginal fistula at our institution.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} the manufacturing of a Cubesat realized within the activities of Space Robotics Laboratory and V-Lab of the II Faculty of Engineering of Bologna University {{in collaboration with the}} Space System Laboratory of the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Despite its small size, this single unit (IU) Cubesat has a system for active attitude control, a redundant telecommunication system, a payload camera and an high efficiency power control system. The subsystems developed for this Cubesat have been also designed to be scaled up for larger satellites as 2 U or 3 U Cubesats. The additional volume can be used for more complex payloads. Thus the satellite can be used as low cost platform for companies, institutions or universities to test components in space. The attitude control subsystem is based on active magnetic system with magnetorquers for detumbling and momentum dumping and three reaction wheels for fine control. It has a total dimension of about 50 x 50 x 50 mm and completely realized by the Space Robotics Laboratory during the PhD activities of one of the authors. A microcontroller implements the control law autonomously or by commands from ground,. taking data from magnetometers integrated in the control system, by solar arrays; reaction wheels and magnetic coils The Cubesat structure has been realized in plastic material (ABS) through "rapid prototyping" technique, thanks to the facilities provided by the V-Lab. The "rapid prototyping" technique has several advantages including fast implementation and low cost. Moreover, concerning the construction of a small satellite, this technique is very useful thanks to the accuracy achievable in details, which sometimes are difficult and expensive to realize with the use of tools machine. The structure must be able to withstand with the launch loads. For this reason, several simulations using a FEM code and intensive vibration test campaign have been performed in the system development phase. The developed communication subsystem has small dimensions, low power consumption and low cost. The main components of the system are the radios, the antennas (one of them is manufactured inside the ABS structure), the amplifiers and the microcontroller. It has been implemented a communication protocol used mainly by radio amateurs, the AX. 25 protocol. The communication system has the capability to transmit both telemetry and data from the payload, in this case a <b>microcamera.</b> Copyright © 2010 by the International Astronautical Federation.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the development of purebred and crossbred embryos through the time lapse of their development. Material and methods: The embryos were produced in vitro from bovine slaughterhouse oocytes and frozen thawed semen. Purebred Embryos (PE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Holstein (H) or Montbeliard (M) semen (PE = HH and MM embryos). Crossbred Embryos (CE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Montbeliard (M) or Holstein (H) semen (CE = HM and MH embryos). Semen of 3 bulls of each breed were used. We performed four sessions of 32 embryos (8 HH, 8 MM, 8 HM, 8 MH) incubated individually in microwells placed under a <b>microcamera</b> (PrimovisionTM). Pictures were taken every 15 minutes until 192 h of development. The media and atmospheric conditions were previously described (Grimard et al., 2013). Development rates and the timing of reaching the 2, 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst stages were registered. Development rates of CE and PE groups were compared using the X 2 test. Fixed effects of oocyte and semen breed and crossbreeding on embryo kinetic parameters were tested by multivariate analysis taking into account the random effect of IVF session. Results and conclusion: 128 embryos were produced. The 2 cells development rate was significantly lower in the CE than in the PE group. No differences were observed for 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst rates (78, 1 vs 92, 2 %; 67, 2 vs 75 %; 53, 1 vs 46, 9 %; 45, 3 vs 40, 6 %; 31, 3 vs 35, 9 %, CE vs PE, respectively, p> 0, 05). The timing of development was similar in both groups (p> 0, 05). On average, CE and PE groups reached 2, 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst stages at 31, 8 h + 5, 9 and 31, 6 h + 6, 0; 42, 9 h + 6, 7 and 43, 2 h + 7, 8; 63, 9 h + 19, 9 and 59, 9 h + 18, 6; 109, 3 h + 10, 4 and 108, 4 + 11, 3; 152, 3 h + 17, 7 and 150, 6 h + 15, 1; respectively.
