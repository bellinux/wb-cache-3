2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on <b>manual</b> <b>tuning</b> of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a modified Kalman filter that performs robust, real-time outlier detection, {{without the need}} for <b>manual</b> parameter <b>tuning</b> by the user. Systems that rely on high quality sensory data (for instance, robotic systems) can be sensitive to data containing outliers. The standard Kalman filter is not robust to outliers, and other variations of the Kalman filter have been proposed to overcome this issue. However, these methods may require <b>manual</b> parameter <b>tuning,</b> use of heuristics or complicated parameter estimation procedures. Our Kalman filter uses a weighted least squares-like approach by introducing weights for each data sample. A data sample with a smaller weight has a weaker contribution when estimating the current time step’s state. Using an incremental variational Expectation-Maximization framework, we learn the weights and system dynamics. We evaluate our Kalman filter algorithm on data from a robotic dog. ...|$|R

40|$|Deformable image {{registration}} is typically formulated as an optimization problem involving a linearly weighted combination of terms {{that correspond to}} objectives of interest (e. g. similarity, deformation magnitude). The weights, along with multiple other parameters, need to be manually tuned for each application, a task currently addressed mainly via trial-and-error approaches. Such approaches can only be successful {{if there is a}} sensible interplay between parameters, objectives, and desired registration outcome. This, however, is not well established. To study this interplay, we use multi-objective optimization, where multiple solutions exist that represent the optimal trade-offs between the objectives, forming a so-called Pareto front. Here, we focus on weight tuning. To study the space a user has to navigate during <b>manual</b> weight <b>tuning,</b> we randomly sample multiple linear combinations. To understand how these combinations relate to desirability of registration outcome, we associate with each outcome a mean target registration error (TRE) based on expert-defined anatomical landmarks. Further, we employ a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that optimizes the weight combinations, yielding a Pareto front of solutions, which can be directly navigated by the user. To study how the complexity of <b>manual</b> weight <b>tuning</b> changes depending on the registration problem, we consider an easy problem, prone-to-prone breast MR {{image registration}}, and a hard problem, prone-to-supine breast MR image registration. Lastly, we investigate how guidance information as an additional objective influences the prone-to-supine registration outcome. Results show that the interplay between weights, objectives, and registration outcome makes <b>manual</b> weight <b>tuning</b> feasible for the prone-to-prone problem, but very challenging for the harder prone-to-supine problem. Here, patient-specific, multi-objective weight optimization is needed, obtaining a mean TRE of 13. 6 mm without guidance information reduced to 7. 3 mm with guidance information, but also providing a Pareto front that exhibits an intuitively sensible interplay between weights, objectives, and registration outcome, allowing outcome selectio...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} method for training linear SVMs (including binary SVMs, SVM regression, and structural SVMs) from large, out-of-core training datasets. Current strategies for large-scale learning {{fall into one of}} two camps; batch algorithms which solve the learning problem given a finite datasets, and online algorithms which can process out-of-core datasets. The former typically requires datasets small enough to fit in memory. The latter is often phrased as a stochastic optimization problem [4, 15]; such algorithms enjoy strong theoretical properties but often require <b>manual</b> <b>tuned</b> annealing schedules, and may converge slowly for problems with large output spaces (e. g., structural SVMs). We discuss an algorithm for an “intermediate” regime in which the data is too large to fit in memory, but the active constraints (support vectors) are small enough to remain in memory. In this case, one can design rather efficient learning algorithms that are as stable as batch algorithms, but capable of processing out-of-core datasets. We have developed such a MATLAB-based solver and used it to train a series of recognition systems [19, 7, 21, 12] for articulated pose estimation, facial analysis, 3 D object recognition, and action classification, all with publicly-available code. This writeup describes the solver in detail.
