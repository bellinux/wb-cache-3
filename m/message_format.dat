25|$|Early {{versions}} of Usenet used Duke's A News software, designed {{for one or}} two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called B News that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983). With a <b>message</b> <b>format</b> that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. C News, developed by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, InterNetNews by Rich Salz was developed {{to take advantage of the}} continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time INN development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message of}} CDMA signals is {{transmitted}} as {{a sequence of}} text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains ephemerides for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) {{and part of the}} almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain Earth rotation parameters, ionosphere models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; UTC leap second correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver. The strings have a version tag to facilitate forward compatibility: future upgrades to the <b>message</b> <b>format</b> will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment {{will be able to use}} additional information from newer satellites.|$|E

2500|$|The high-precision {{signal is}} {{broadcast}} in phase quadrature with the standard-precision signal, effectively {{sharing the same}} carrier wave, but with a ten-times-higher bandwidth than the open signal. [...] The <b>message</b> <b>format</b> of the high-precision signal remains unpublished, although attempts at reverse-engineering indicate that the superframe is composed of 72 frames, each containing 5 strings of 100 bits and taking 10 seconds to transmit, with total length of 36 000 bits or 720 seconds (12 minutes) for the whole navigational message. The additional data are seemingly allocated to critical Luni-Solar acceleration parameters and clock correction terms.|$|E
2500|$|Noteworthy is Leitner's {{innovative}} {{energy in}} constituting poetic formats by centering {{a body of}} texts around a common principle – for example, his anthology SMS-Lyrik, on poetry in the text <b>message</b> <b>format</b> (SMS: 170 characters per message) or texts associated with the cultural sphere of Bavaria in Ois is Easy. In such projects, Leitner's editorial work has defined many formal parameters in the art form under real market conditions. In its review of the Bavarian anthology Ois is Easy, the Bayerischer Rundfunk said: [...] "Here's a collection of texts from Bavaria, in many registers, in High German and in Dialect, from every cultural and linguistic region of Bavaria. The poets lined up in this anthology range from [...] to Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Michael Krüger, Reiner Kunze, and many more to Ludwig Steinherr. This book is a fresh sounding out of the present-day literary scene in Bavaria." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} for an attacker to modify the request, in this example switching the requested waffle from [...] "eggo" [...] to [...] "liege." [...] This {{can be done by}} taking advantage of a flexibility in the <b>message</b> <b>format</b> if duplicate content in the query string gives preference to the latter value. This flexibility does not indicate an exploit in the <b>message</b> <b>format,</b> because the <b>message</b> <b>format</b> was never designed to be cryptographically secure in the first place, without the signature algorithm to help it.|$|E

Modeling for the schema flexibility this investigation needs intensive care; to allow the storage of multiple structural schemas. This way one main goal of big data can be achieved i.e. variety.
