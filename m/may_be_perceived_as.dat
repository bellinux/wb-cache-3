5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} ruling the court must {{determine}} whether a work is transformative {{in a way that}} gives a new expression, meaning or message to the original work. In this case, the court ruled that the [...] "ad <b>may</b> reasonably <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> <b>as</b> commenting on the seriousness and even pretentiousness of the original." [...] It also ruled that the ad differed from the original [...] "in a way that <b>may,</b> reasonably, <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> commenting, through ridicule on what a viewer might reasonably think is the undue self-importance conveyed by the subject of the Leibovitz photograph." ...|$|R

25|$|Any {{experience}} {{which is}} inconsistent with {{the organization of the}} structure of the self <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{features}} {{may include}} hypertension, {{and heart rate}} that may be rapid or irregular in character; these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> palpitations. Less common findings include left ventricular hypertrophy, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, systemic embolization, death from cardiovascular collapse and resistance to some drug effects (digoxin, coumadin).|$|E
25|$|Known {{members of}} the {{community}} may be accused as witches, or the witches <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> supernatural, non-human entities. In early modern Europe and Britain such accusations led to the executions {{of tens of thousands of}} people, who were seen to be in league with Satan. Those accused of being satanic witches were often practitioners of (usually benign) folk magic.|$|E
50|$|Culturally, {{however, the}} {{division}} is more ambiguous. In the eastern provinces like Jiangsu and Anhui, the Yangtze River <b>may</b> instead <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the north-south boundary {{instead of the}} Huai River, {{but this is a}} recent development.|$|R

50|$|Other {{variants}} of database publishing are the rendering of content for direct PDF output. This approach prevents manual intervention {{on the final}} output, since PDF is not (comfortably) editable. This <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a limitation in situations like report generation where manual editability is not needed or not desired.|$|R
25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|Within Christian traditions, many {{instances}} reported involve images of Jesus or other Christian figures seen in food; in the Muslim world, structures {{in food and}} other natural objects <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> religious text in Arabic script, particularly the word Allah or verses from the Qur'an. Many religious believers view them as real manifestations of miraculous origin; a sceptical view is that such perceptions are examples of pareidolia.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} involve states being {{reluctant to}} relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e.g., Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement {{negotiations with the}} European Union. Many Tanzanians are also concerned because creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of labour and capital. Free movement of labour <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> highly desirable in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance {{to the idea of}} ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda.|$|E
25|$|The above {{result may}} or <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> surprising. A {{classical}} system would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below) {{would certainly be}} required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for {{the outcome of a}} measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This <b>may</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.|$|R
50|$|Luna is {{the first}} young adult novel to feature a {{transgender}} character, aside from Carol Plum-Ucci's What Happened to Lani Garver in which the main character <b>may</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> transgender. Peters introduced {{the idea that a}} transgender person <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> an extreme form of homosexuality as one may have previously thought.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the peer}} tutor {{is seen by}} the tutee as being more at their own level, advice given by the tutor <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{accepted}} more readily than advice from a teacher. Another key {{reason for this is}} that a peer tutor does not give any grade on the paper, whereas a teacher serving in a tutor role <b>may</b> still <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> someone who grades papers.|$|R
25|$|Increased {{distress}} to tissue causes capillaries {{to break}} under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps {{into the surrounding}} tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.|$|E
25|$|Psychology of the sacred, {{taking stock}} of the human condition, conveys that people {{construct}} meaning from that which is without meaning; stated differently, culture gives context to lived experience. Therefore, both meaning and absence of meaning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> being co-existents. Cultural context as constructed meaning and memetic transmission engenders social, existential, and spiritual comfort in a tenuous and arbitrary lived experience and millieu: perception as a participatory event parsing experience into meaningful units. The crossroads or intersections of evolutionary psychology of religion, pattern recognition, neuroaesthetics and symbolic communication lend {{to the construction of}} meanings as group cohesion and bond-forming in human society.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is home to}} {{a number}} of {{perceptions}} about Canadian culture, due to the countries' partially shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features common to both the US and Canada. For example, the average Canadian <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> more reserved than his or her American counterpart. Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom, known for a more relaxed national demeanour.|$|E
5000|$|Schroeder stairs (Schröder's stairs) is {{an optical}} {{illusion}} {{which is a}} two-dimensional drawing which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> either <b>as</b> a drawing of a staircase leading {{from left to right}} downwards or the same staircase only turned upside down, a classical example of perspective reversal in psychology of perception. It is named after the German natural scientist Heinrich G. F. Schröder, who published it in 1858.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of programming idioms for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed {{in the context of}} using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a low-level programming language. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but <b>may</b> then <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> obscure or foreign.|$|R
50|$|One-time {{subscribers}} of The Bangkok Recorder included King Mongkut {{and various}} Thai nobles. The newspaper eventually closed due to unprofitability. Bradley {{wrote in the}} paper urging subscribers to pay their fees. Lack of payment <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> the result of disapproval of Bradley's subject matter. In addition to local and foreign news, Bradley wrote on general topics, including science and politics. His writings on Christianity and Buddhism <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> critical of the dominant religion.|$|R
25|$|As for irrational numbers, none of {{them have}} a finite {{representation}} in any of the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and duodecimal ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in an irrational number. For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating representation in that base). Moreover, the infinite series of digits of an irrational number does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and duodecimal representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E
500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a freak novelty by an awful lot of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|Rowe {{announced}} {{that she was pregnant}} with Jackson's second child in November 1997. The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed that he was so anxious following the birth of his daughter, that he [...] "snatched" [...] her and ran straight home [...] "with all the placenta and everything all over her". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen. Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, {{in the hope that the}} Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter. An official for the Pope informed Jackson by letter that the leader of the Catholic Church would not participate in what <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a publicity stunt.|$|E
5000|$|Some hand {{movements}} {{are not considered}} to be gestures. They consist of manipulations either of the person or some object (e.g. clothing, pencils, eyeglasses)—the kinds of scratching, fidgeting, rubbing, tapping, and touching that people often do with their hands. Such behaviors are referred to as adapters. They <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> meaningfully related to the speech in which they accompany, but may {{serve as the basis for}} dispositional inferences of the speaker's emotion (nervous, uncomfortable, bored.) ...|$|R

The silver spots {{on the underside of}} the wings <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by preditors <b>as</b> dew-drops on grass, mimicking the butterfly's favorite overnight resting place.|$|R
30|$|Age has {{an impact}} on the {{perception}} of smile esthetics in terms of maxillary gingival display and the presence of a black triangle between the maxillary central incisors, but not of the incisal edge position of the maxillary central incisors. An ideal smile based on academic considerations <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the most attractive by laypeople. Due to the variation in esthetic perception by each person, participation between orthodontists and patients for decision-making and treatment planning is crucial to generate successful results.|$|R
500|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of the}} film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> his life flashing before his eyes. At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E
2500|$|These may {{be further}} {{subdivided}} into [...] "four gates, forty levels" [...] (Dört Kapı Kırk Makam). The first gate (religious law) is considered elementary (and this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> subtle criticism of other Muslim traditions).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addressed the}} reduced impact of cues under high processing motivation of persuasion experiments. The results of 3 studies suggested that such reduced impact {{is due to}} a relevance override whereby any more subjectively relevant information swamps the effects of any less subjectively relevant information, given the recipient's sufficient motivation to process both.

Examples of minor anomalies can include curvature of the 5th finger (clinodactyly), a third nipple, tiny indentations of the skin near the ears (preauricular pits), shortness of the 4th metacarpal or metatarsal bones, or dimples over the lower spine (sacral dimples).
