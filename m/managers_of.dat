5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E
5|$|Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut {{the season}} short and {{cancelled}} the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created {{a de facto}} mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as <b>Managers</b> <b>of</b> the Year. Two franchises, the New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers, {{have not had a}} manager win the award.|$|E

Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system. The William M.

5|$|At the time, {{very few}} <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> pop groups {{knew about the}} income music {{merchandising}} could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
