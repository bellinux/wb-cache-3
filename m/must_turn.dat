5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm <b>must</b> <b>turn</b> when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need.

Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction.

5|$|Watts was {{recruited}} by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 national draft. Drafted at seventeen years of age, {{he was in the}} last draft where a player could be recruited at seventeen, with the AFL requiring that, effective from the 2009 AFL draft, a player <b>must</b> <b>turn</b> at least eighteen years of age in the year they are drafted. The hype placed on him by the club was high when he was presented with the number four guernsey by six-time Melbourne premiership player, Ron Barassi—a guernsey number previously worn by club legend and the winner of ten premierships with the club as a player and coach, Norm Smith—in a ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) two days after being drafted. Completing year twelve in 2009, the need to manage school with football saw the club electing to not play him in pre-season matches during the NAB Cup.|$|E
