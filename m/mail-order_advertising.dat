50|$|As {{the economy}} {{expanded}} {{across the world}} during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, {{the success of this}} advertising format eventually led to the growth of <b>mail-order</b> <b>advertising.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{rapid rise}} of d-CON {{has been cited}} {{as a case study}} in {{effective}} <b>mail-order</b> <b>advertising</b> and called [...] "as brilliant a record for a new product as you're likely to find anywhere, anytime." [...] At one time, Ratner's businesses were the eight largest purchaser of television ads in the United States. [...] He has been described as [...] "the king of telemarketers" [...] from the early days of television. [...] A 1954 article in Broadcasting Telecasting declared [...] "no mention of mail order on TV would be complete without mentioning the success of the active Lee Ratner." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ratner {{continued}} the aggressive advertising campaign, {{turning to the}} relatively new medium of television. [...] McKesson & Robbins was contracted with for retail distribution. [...] At the peak of its advertising spending, d-CON had ads running on 475 television and radio stations, in every farm paper in the country, and in several major newspapers. On May 1, 1951, the company ceased mail-order distribution, having placed the product in more than 40,000 drug, grocery, and hardware stores. [...] Daytime ad buys were then expanded to support retail distribution to individual consumers. [...] Over {{the first eight months}} of its existence, d-CON had spent approximately $1 million on advertising, generating sales of $100,000 a week. [...] The company's rapid rise has been cited as a case study in effective <b>mail-order</b> <b>advertising</b> and called [...] "as brilliant a record for a new product as you're likely to find anywhere, anytime." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 30-minute audio {{recordings}} {{of many of}} the [...] "missing" [...] episodes are contained in the Library of Congress in the Armed Forces Radio collection. Many 1970s-era episodes have been licensed to distributors that <b>advertise</b> <b>mail-order</b> offers on late-night TV. The later shows are stored in an underground salt mine outside Hutchinson, Kansas.|$|R
50|$|The E. F. Hodgson Company of Dover, Massachusetts, {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{companies}} who used specialty <b>mail-order</b> catalogs, to <b>advertise</b> and sell sectional and ready-cut houses. From a small New England town, the Hodgson Company competed with economic giants such as Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward, to attract the attention of a growing America in the 1890s. Using the railroad to access its market, the specialty house mail-order catalog company competed all over the United States. There is still a good argument for the theory that the Hodgson Company was in the market before Sears, and equaled them in production. But even so, Hodgson became better known outside of the United States in such places as Belgium, Italy, France, Newfoundland, and Jerusalem. From 1892 to 1944, the Hodgson Company was arguably the most important economic force of the simple agricultural community of Dover.|$|R
50|$|Suddenly the {{low price}} of {{reaching}} millions worldwide, {{and the possibility}} of selling to or hearing from those people at the same moment when they were reached, promised to overturn established business dogma in <b>advertising,</b> <b>mail-order</b> sales, customer relationship management, and many more areas. The web was a new killer appâ€”it could bring together unrelated buyers and sellers in seamless and low-cost ways. Entrepreneurs around the world developed new business models, and ran to their nearest venture capitalist. While some of the new entrepreneurs had experience in business and economics, the majority were simply people with ideas, and did not manage the capital influx prudently. Additionally, many dot-com business plans were predicated on the assumption that by using the Internet, they would bypass the distribution channels of existing businesses and therefore not have to compete with them; when the established businesses with strong existing brands developed their own Internet presence, these hopes were shattered, and the newcomers were left attempting to break into markets dominated by larger, more established businesses. Many did not have the ability to do so.|$|R
