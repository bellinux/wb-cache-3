5000|$|The device {{contains}} {{not only}} the cellular antenna but also about 22 MB (10 MB on older versions) of storage memory accessible to the operating system as a USB mass storage device formatted with CDfs, thus emulating a CD-ROM drive. In this memory, E220 devices supplied by mobile operators may contain 3G dialer software written by the operator, while Huawei-branded devices contain Huawei's original dialing software, which they call 'Dashboard'. Huawei's Dashboard and updates for it are also available from Huawei's website, or the 11.313.02.00.01 firmware for 7.2 Mbit/s from NetCom (in reality [...] 'flashing' [...] this device means writing a firmware image to its internal flash memory, which is different from [...] "updating the dashboard", which is simply writing a new CDFS disc image to the USB mass storage device that appears in the operating system). Flashing the firmware of this device doesn't change the USB <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>memory</b> used for the operator's software, therefore connection settings (such as APN) will be retained. When the device is first attached, Windows will automatically run the software stored on it, unless that feature has been turned off in Windows. This feature can be bypassed by pressing the Shift key while attaching the device, or by turning off the autostart feature entirely. It is possible to remove the operator branding by flashing the device with Huawei's Mobile Partner software.Huawei does not publicly release firmware updates for its devices, only Dashboard updates. The standard way of obtaining firmware updates is through the service provider, however some firmware updates are publicly available over the Internet and some users have cross-flashed (i.e. using a firmware provided by service provider [...] "X" [...] with modem supplied by service provider [...] "Y") their modems without trouble.Updating the modem's Dashboard does not remove or affect the network-lock (that may be in effect with modems purchased subsidized from a service provider) that prevents you from using the modem with any service provider. However updating the modem's firmware may remove this network-unlock or even the opposite, turn a network-unlock free modem into an unlocked one.|$|E

This new design, based on scanning probe techniques, combines the low volume and power consumption of the FlashRAM, with the high capacity of the hard disk. The small form factor of the device makes it an excellent candidate for mass storage in handheld embedded systems. Its hierarchical architecture allows us to make a trade-off between data-rate, access time and power consumption. The power consumption scales linearly with the desired data-rate, and is expected to be lower than what can be achieved with competing technologies...|$|E

Nanoscale epitaxial ferroelectric capacitors with terabyte per inch square equivalent density were fabricated by the deposition of top electrodes onto a pulsed laser deposited lead zirconate titanate thin film by electron beam evaporation through ultrathin anodic aluminum oxide membrane stencil masks. Using bias pulses, the nanoscale capacitors were uniformly switched and proved to be individually addressable.

An optimal controller is developed based on the integrated system model, but due to the complexity of the controllers and tremendous computational efforts involved, a multilevel technique is used in designing and implementing the controllers. The basis of the multilevel technique is described and a computational algorithm is discussed for the control of the finishing mill system. To reduce the <b>mass</b> <b>storage,</b> <b>memory</b> requirements and the computational time of the processor, a sub-optimal multilevel technique is applied to design the controllers of the finishing mill.

25|$|The {{proprietary}} {{nature of}} the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB-based card readers if necessary. These card readers present a standard USB <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> interface to <b>memory</b> cards, thus separating the operating system from {{the details of the}} underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.|$|R

40|$|Two stage open queuing {{networks}} {{are used for}} modelling the subsystem-behaviour in computers and communication networks, <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> devices, <b>memory</b> servers, and queuing analysis of wireless mobile cellular networks. The queuing analysis of wireless systems are essential in order to quantify the impacts of different factors on quality of service (QoS) performance measures so that wireless protocols can be designed and/or tuned in an optimal manner. In that sense two stage open queuing systems are particularly important to model handoff phenomena, especially for the integration of two different systems such as cellular and wireless local area networks (WLANs). Analytical solutions for two dimensional Markov processes suffer from the state space explosion problem. The numerical difficulties caused by large state spaces, {{makes it difficult to}} handle multiple servers at the second stage of a tandem queuing system together with server failures and repairs. This study presents a new approach to analytical modelling of open networks offering improvements in alleviating this problem. The proposed solution is a hybrid version, which combines well known spectral expansion, and hierarchical Markov reward rate approaches. Using this approach, two-stage open networks with multiple servers, break-downs, and repairs at the second stage and feedback can be modelled as three dimensional Markov processes and solved for performability measures. Comparative results show that the new algorithm used for solution, provides high degree of accuracy, and it is computationally more efficient than the existing approaches. The proposed model is capable of solving other three dimensional Markov processes...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload {{includes}} the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, intended to fully characterize the radiation {{environment for the}} MSL mission. The RAD instrument operations concept is intended to reduce impact to spacecraft resources and effort for the MSL operations team. By design, RAD autonomously performs regular science observations {{without the need for}} frequent commanding from the Rover Compute Element (RCE). RAD operates with pre-defined "sleep" and "observe" periods, with an adjustable duty cycle for meeting power and data volume constraints during the mission. At {{the start of a new}} science observation, RAD performs a pre-observation activity to assess count rates for selected RAD detector elements. Based on this assessment, RAD can enter "solar event" mode, in which instrument parameters (including observation duration) are selected to more effectively characterize the environment. At the end of each observation period, RAD stores a time-tagged, fixed length science data packet in its non-volatile <b>mass</b> <b>memory</b> <b>storage.</b> The operating cadence is defined by adjustable parameters, also stored in non-volatile memory within the instrument. Periodically, the RCE executes an on-board sequence to transfer RAD science data packets from the instrument <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> to the MSL downlink buffer.

40|$|Recently, flash {{memories}} {{have become}} a competitive solution for <b>mass</b> <b>storage.</b> The flash <b>memories</b> have rather different properties compared with the rotary hard drives. That is, the writing of flash memories is constrained, and flash memories can endure only limited numbers of erases. Therefore, the design goals for the flash memory systems are quite different from these for other memory systems. In this paper, we consider the problem of coding efficiency. We define the "coding-efficiency" {{as the amount of}} information that one flash memory cell can be used to record per cost. Because each flash memory cell can endure a roughly fixed number of erases, the cost of data recording can be well-defined. We define "payload" as the amount of information that one flash memory cell can represent at a particular moment. By using information-theoretic arguments, we prove a coding theorem for achievable coding rates. We prove an upper and lower bound for coding efficiency. We show in this paper that there exists a fundamental trade-off between "payload" and "coding efficiency". The results in this paper may provide useful insights on the design of future flash memory systems.
