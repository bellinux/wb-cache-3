In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer.

In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households.
