25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{formation is}} the Morrison Formation. This area covers 1.5 million square miles, stretching from Montana to New Mexico in the United States. It {{is considered one}} of the world's most significant dinosaur burial grounds, and its many fossils can be found in museums around the world. This site includes dinosaur fossils from a few dinosaur species, including the Allosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and Brontosaurus. There are also lungfish, freshwater mollusks, ferns and conifers. This deposit was formed by a humid, tropical climate with lakes, swamps, and rivers, which deposited <b>mudrock.</b> Inevitably, <b>mudrock</b> preserved countless specimens from the late Jurassic, roughly 150 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous <b>mudrock</b> {{formations}} is the Burgess Shale in Western Canada, which formed during the Cambrian. At this site, soft bodied creatures were preserved, some in whole, by the activity of mud in a sea. Solid skeletons are, generally, the only remnants of ancient life preserved; however, the Burgess Shale includes hard body parts such as bones, skeletons, teeth, and also soft body parts such as muscles, gills, and digestive systems. The Burgess Shale is one {{of the most}} significant fossil locations on Earth, preserving innumerable specimens of 500 million year old species, and its preservation is due to the protection of <b>mudrock.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shale {{is a fine}} grained, hard, {{laminated}} <b>mudrock,</b> {{consisting of}} clay minerals, and quartz and feldspar silt. Shale is lithified and fissile. It must have at least 50-percent of its particles measure less than 0.062mm. This term is confined to argillaceous, or clay-bearing, rock.|$|E
50|$|Rocks {{that are}} {{classified}} as <b>mudrocks</b> are very fine grained. Silt and clay represent at least 50% of the material that <b>mudrocks</b> are composed of. Classification schemes for <b>mudrocks</b> tend to vary but most {{are based on the}} grain size of the major constituents. In <b>mudrocks,</b> these are generally silt, and clay.|$|R
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of civilization, when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand, to now, <b>mudrocks</b> have been important. The first book on <b>mudrocks,</b> Geologie des Argils by Millot, was not published until 1964; however, scientists, engineers, and oil producers have understood the significance of <b>mudrocks</b> since {{the discovery of the}} Burgess Shale and the relatedness of <b>mudrocks</b> and oil. Literature on this omnipresent rock-type has been increasing in recent years, and technology continues to allow for better analysis.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>mudrocks</b> form in oceans or lakes, {{because these}} environments provide the quiet waters {{necessary}} for deposition. Although <b>mudrocks</b> {{can be found}} in every depositional environment on Earth, the majority are found in lakes and oceans.|$|R
25|$|Eventually, the <b>mudrock</b> {{will move}} its way {{kilometers}} below the subsurface, where pressure and temperature cook the mudstone into a metamorphosed gneiss. The metamorphosed gneiss will {{make its way}} to the surface once again as country rock or as magma in a volcano, and the whole process will begin again.|$|E
25|$|After being {{deposited}} {{in their final}} resting places the carcasses were torn apart, had their bones trampled and chewed by scavengers. These processes left the abrasion and toothmarks seen on the bones preserved at H97-02. Chemical reactions between the decaying dinosaur flesh and floodwaters caused iron to precipitate {{out of the water}} and formed the ironstone concretions commonly found in the <b>mudrock</b> hosting the mega-bonebed.|$|E
25|$|Sandstones and carbonates record high-energy {{events in}} our history, {{and they are}} much easier to study. Interbedded between the high-energy events are <b>mudrock</b> {{formations}} that have recorded quieter, normal conditions in our Earth's history. It is the quieter, normal events of our geologic history we don't yet understand. Sandstones provide the big tectonic picture and some indications of water depth; mudrocks record oxygen content, a generally richer fossil abundance and diversity, and a much more informative geochemistry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mudrocks</b> are {{a diverse}} group of very {{fine-grained}} argillaceous sedimentary rocks that are frequently encountered in most types of engineering projects. Upon excavation, the release of overburden stress and changes in the moisture content may cause certain apparently well indurated <b>mudrocks</b> to slake, producing a soil-like material. Because many <b>mudrocks</b> are nondurable, they have gained a reputation as problematic soft rocks. Geologists and engineers are confronted with the problem of selecting adequate parameters for accurately evaluating engineering behavior of <b>mudrocks.</b> The use of a single parameter (e. g. grain-size) is never considered to be enough and a combination of several parameters are normally preferred for the classification of <b>mudrocks.</b> Compressive strength, slake durability index, plasticity characteristics, swelling potential, absorption and density are some of the parameters that had been used by several investigators in the past. In order to overcome this problem, considerable research attention has recently been devoted to the use of geological properties (grain size, clay content and clay composition, texture, fracture frequency, degree of lamination, etc.) in conjunction with the engineering characteristics for classification purposes.

2500|$|<b>Mudrocks</b> are a {{class of}} fine grained siliciclastic {{sedimentary}} rocks. The varying types of <b>mudrocks</b> include: siltstone, claystone, mudstone, slate, and shale.

25|$|Mudrocks, {{especially}} black shale, are {{the source}} and containers of precious petroleum sources throughout the world.

Mudrocks have low porosity, they are impermeable, and often, if the <b>mudrock</b> is not black shale, it remains useful as a seal to petroleum and natural gas reservoirs. In the case of petroleum found in a reservoir, the rock surrounding the petroleum is not the source rock, whereas black shale is a source rock.|$|E
25|$|A {{claystone}} is lithified, and non-fissile <b>mudrock.</b> In {{order for}} a rock {{to be considered a}} claystone, it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of a millimeter in particle size. Clay minerals are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, or able to flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.|$|E

Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was not for him, he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and <b>Mudrock,</b> who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The diagenetic {{history of}} an {{interbedded}} sequence of Middle Jurassic Sleipner (or Pentland), Hugin and Heather Formation sandstones and <b>mudrocks</b> from the Brae Area {{has been investigated}} using petrographic, stable isotope, fluid inclusion and K-Ar dating techniques. Generally, similar diagenetic processes affected both the <b>mudrocks</b> and sandstones resulting {{in the formation of}} carbonate, quartz and clay cements and evidence of dissolution and secondary porosity except for the absence of kaolinite in the Hugin Formation. The <b>mudrocks</b> were possible sources of some components involved in sandstone diagenesis but were not passive xporters of such reactants as similar reactions also occurred in the <b>mudrocks.</b> The stable isotope data indicate that most of the diagenetic processes occurred in the presence of marine or evolved marine pore-waters. The Middle Jurassic sequence encountered by wells in the North Brae-East Miller Area (UK Blocks 16 / 7 and 16 / 8) on the western margin of the South Viking Graben (Fig. 1 A) is summarized in Fig. lB.

5000|$|According to Blatt, Middleton and Murray [...] <b>mudrocks</b> {{that are}} {{composed}} mainly of silt particles {{are classified as}} siltstones. In turn, rocks that possess clay as the majority particle are called claystones. In geology, a mixture of both silt and clay is called mud. Rocks that possess large amounts of both clay and silt are called mudstones. In some cases the term shale {{is also used to}} refer to <b>mudrocks</b> and is still widely accepted by most. However, others have used the term shale to further divide <b>mudrocks</b> based on the percentage of clay constituents. The plate-like shape of clay allows its particles to stack up one on top of another creating laminae or beds. The more clay present in a given specimen, the more laminated a rock is. Shale, in this case, is reserved for <b>mudrocks</b> that are laminated, while mudstone refers those that are not.|$|R

40|$|<b>Mudrocks</b> {{from three}} lower Paleozoic basins in the British Caledonides (southern Lake District, {{northern}} Lake District and Southern Uplands) were investigated {{to determine the}} influence of sub-greenschist facies metamorphism on Li and the factors that control Li in fine-grained terrigenous sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic grade, as determined by KI (KÃ¼bler index) does not correlate with Li content ([Li]) and Î´ 7 Li, indicating that sub-greenschist facies metamorphism has negligible effect on Li in these rocks. Collectively, the data for all three basins show a negative correlation between [Li] and Î´ 7 Li and a positive correlation between [Li] and the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), suggesting that provenance exerts the greatest control on Li in <b>mudrocks.</b> Samples from the northern Lake District, which were deposited in an extensional basin, have homogeneous REE patterns, similar to shale composites (PAAS), the highest CIA, Th/U and [Li] and the lowest Î´ 7 Li and ÎµNd, consistent with their derivation from a highly weathered, ancient continental source. By contrast, <b>mudrocks</b> from the Southern Uplands range to the lowest CIA, Th/U and [Li] and have the highest Î´ 7 Li and ÎµNd. These samples were deposited in a forearc basin on the southern margin of the Laurentian craton and contain volcanic detritus. Their REE patterns are the most variable, ranging from average shale-like patterns to less LREE-enriched patterns. The compositional heterogeneity within the Southern Uplands <b>mudrocks</b> is consistent with a mixed provenance that includes juvenile crustal materials (lower [Li], ÎµNd and Th/U, higher Î´ 7 Li), likely derived from the arc, as well as more highly weathered continental detritus. <b>Mudrocks</b> from the southern Lake District were deposited in a foreland basin, and exhibit geochemical characteristics intermediate between the northern Lake District and the Southern Uplands <b>mudrocks,</b> indicating their derivation from a mixed source. Our study shows that Li concentrations and Î´ 7 Li can provide additional information on the degree of weathering of the provenance of <b>mudrocks...</b>|$|R
