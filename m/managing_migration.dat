40|$|The United Kingdom, {{like many}} {{developed}} world economies, has witnessed unprecedented immigration {{since the early}} 1990 s. Also in line with other developed world economies, the UK has adopted a “managed migration” policy paradigm. The paper argues that the operation of this paradigm is best understood with reference to two key concepts: migration policy “venues” and migration policy “filters. ” In terms of the former, the paper argues that <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> policy is associated with outward, upward, and downward rescaling and commensurate venue growth and diversification. In terms of the latter, the paper argues that six policy filters (legal, geographical, credential, transfer-based, monetary, and humanitarian) are commonly used to determine legitimate forms of migration but that one (the geographical filter) has been particularly prominent within the UK's <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> policy paradigm...|$|R

By surveying a UN report provided by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations, this paper attempts to offer a managerial perspective on the cultural aspects of migration, as effected by the involvement of the United Nations in handling this global crisis. Particularly, this study focuses on raising the cultural question about the managerial methods used by the UN in calibrating this reality within the framework of the historical and territorial perspective of the phenomenon itself. The findings of this study are relevant in the context of developing new tactics for <b>managing</b> <b>migration,</b> applicable to specific international institutions and geographic areas...|$|E
40|$|Of the 175 {{million people}} (2. 9 % of the world's population) living outside {{their country of}} birth in 2000, 65 million were {{economically}} active. The {{rise in the number}} of people migrating is significant for many developing countries because they are losing their better-educated nationals to richer countries. Medical practitioners and nurses represent a small proportion of the highly skilled workers who migrate, but the loss for developing countries of human resources in the health sector may mean that the capacity of the health system to deliver health care equitably is significantly compromised. It is unlikely that migration will stop given the advances in global communications and the development of global labour markets in some fields, which now include nursing.

40|$|By definition, {{migration}} {{stands between}} states, individuals and global regimes. It touches on legitimate concerns of different communities, individuals and global actors. Hence, the very possibility of <b>managing</b> <b>migration</b> {{in a way}} that satisfies the legitimate justice claims of all involved is constrained {{by the nature of the}} issue. Accordingly, the EU seems to be particularly well equipped to strike a balance among the different justice claims of states, humans and subjective individuals. This is so precisely because of the EU’s nature as a complex polity with a sui generis governance (including states, individuals, groups), traditionally compliant with and attentive to the development of international law, and a peculiar understanding of its ‘problematic’ borders. Whether the Union succeeds or not in this titanic enterprise remains however to be explored, and this report presents the first steps in GLOBUS’ exploration of the EU’s contribution to global justice in the area of migration...|$|E

40|$|What can {{the case}} of {{temporary}} labor migration regulation {{tell us about the}} rule of law and administrative justice from managed to neoliberal capitalism in the United States? This paper demonstrates how the enforcement of temporary migrant labor contracts from state-led economic planning into a market-driven order (1942 - 2011) challenges dominant understandings of economic rights in jurisprudential theory and histories of the American administrative state. Contrary to existing conceptualizations of the managed capitalist state as a rights-abrogator, I show how regulatory agencies created and backed private contracts (1942 - 64). I subsequently trace what happened to this legal form through the roll-back of <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> in the post- 1964 period. Counterintuitively, from the perspective of temporary labor migration, neoliberalism is not about the strengthening of private contract, but contract's changing form in kind and process. Through the retreat of <b>managed</b> <b>migration,</b> private contracts are deformalized and subsumed to a fragmented, "bottom-up" administrative justice, empowering employers in the legal process...|$|R

The Migration policies pursue two major objectives: regulating the outflow of migrants and protection of their rights during their stay abroad, the main objective being protection of migrant’s rights. According to scholars the migration from the Philippines is going through a transition these years caused by a growth in the annual outflow and a geographic diversification, which puts pressure on the model {{as well as on the}} states ability to secure their citizens overseas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pakistan and the Philippines are {{two leading}} source {{countries}} for international migration. Currently about 3. 75 million Pakistanis and 7. 0 million Filipinos {{are estimated to}} be living or working overseas. Both the countries have nearly 3 decades of experience of <b>managing</b> <b>migration</b> through sets of policies and programs aimed at promoting overseas employment opportunities for their citizens, maximizing the benefits of migration for migrants, protecting migrants against exploitation and hazards and improving the welfare of migrants and their families. Policies have also been introduced for maximizing the inflow of cash remittances through formal institutional channels. The relevance and adequacy of the policy measures is examined from the perspectives of making migration more “affordable ” to include more social groups, and productive use of capital and human assets resulting from migration for improved and sustainable livelihoods of migrants and their families. The paper highlights policy strengths and gaps based on available empirical evidence from the two countries and makes recommendations for policy improvements and further research...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2008 South Africa (SA) had 1631 {{registered}} advanced {{life support}} (ALS) paramedics to provide pre-hospital advanced life support care to {{a population of}} approximately 50 million. Compared to globally accepted ratios, the number of ALS paramedics in South Africa {{can be considered as}} grossly inadequate. This current shortage may be ascribed to migration. However, the extent and nature of this migration, the factors that have contributed to them leaving the country and the existence or effectiveness of implemented strategies that attempt to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of SA ALS paramedic is not known for sure. Methods: The study consisted of a two-phase mixed method descriptive survey. A subset of SA ALS paramedics made up the study population. Quantitative data (Phase One) was obtained from a web-based survey distributed to the accessible population (N =  97). Thereafter, qualitative data (Phase Two) was gathered through in-depth interviews with selected information rich participants (n =  10) also from within the accessible population. Through methodological triangulation, data from Phase One and Phase Two were integrated to obtain an in-depth understanding of South African ALS paramedic migration. In addition, the study investigated whether strategies that attempted to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of SA ALS paramedics existed, and if they did, how effective have they been. Result: Fifty-one of 97 (53 %) ALS paramedics responded to the questionnaire in Phase One. Of those, 24 (47. 1 %) were found to be working inside South Africa, while 27 (52. 9 %) were working outside South Africa. Working conditions, physical security, and economic considerations were ranked as the top three major factors contributing to the decision or intended decision to migrate. Initiatives to manage the shortage of ALS paramedics in the public sector EMS do exist; however, it appears to be inadequate at its current rate of progress. Conclusion: This study suggests that ALS paramedics in SA are leaving to find work outside the country because of working conditions, physical security, and economic considerations. The current measures to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> appear to be ineffective, indicating that new or additional strategies to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of ALS paramedics in SA may be required...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the Chinese {{government}} replaced strict control over outmigration with measures of ‘infrastructural governance’. Instead of dictating who can and who cannot leave, the state <b>manages</b> <b>migration</b> by influencing the sociotechnical conditions of mobility, for instance by defining what responsibilities commercial intermediaries should shoulder and what training a migrant should receive before departure. This article unpacks infrastructural governance {{by examining the}} working of ‘base’, or jidi in Chinese. A base is a tight cluster {{of public and private}} institutions in a labour source place, designated by the government as an important player in the recruitment of migrant workers. The base <b>manages</b> <b>migration</b> by conditioning the activities that lead to migration, such as how people choose destinations, make payments, and deal with uncertainties in preparing for migration. The base also works on migrants’ relations with family members, village cadres and fellow migrants in order to shape their mobilities. The ethnographic research on the base shows that, infrastructural governance regulates migration effectively, but makes migration more complicated and more costly for the migrants. Infrastructural governance empowers commercial intermediaries and local government, and as such affects broader social relations in the community...|$|R

Preference of residence approval and status change has also been given to temporary residents who have local work or study experience. As temporary residents in their host countries, international students are seen as potential skilled workers who are more easily integrated into local labour markets due to their verified credentials, country-specific experience and skills, and social connections (Tremblay 2005; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD 2007; Chaloff and Lemaître 2009).|$|E
40|$|Migration {{policy and}} its role in {{implementation}} of population development strategy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Abstract This work addresses the issues of migration policy {{and its role}} in population development of Kazakhstan. Migration and demographic development of the Republic of Kazakhstan had become prominent subjects of strategic policy under the new geopolitical reality and socio-economic development since the early 1990 s. The intensive outflow of population during this period resulted in change of different quantitative as well as qualitative population characteristics. At the same time, the ethno-demographic disproportions maintained in the previous decades speeded up the "nation-building" process which was represented namely by policy on ethnic return migration. Thus, under these circumstances migration and demographic policies were placed among the priority issues of national security of the RK.
