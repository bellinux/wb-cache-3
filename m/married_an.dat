5|$|Bohemond {{remained}} a close {{ally of the}} Byzantine Empire. He fought against Mleh, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, assisting in the restoration of Byzantine rule in the Cilician plain. He also made alliances with the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damascus against Saladin, who had begun to unite the Muslim countries along {{the borders of the}} crusader states.

30|$|Figure  1 {{shows that}} {{migrants}} who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German have lower intensions to return {{both before and}} after marriage than their counterparts who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse. Among women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse, we actually observe a drop in intentions to return a few years before marriage. For women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse, intentions to return slightly increase for a few years subsequent to marriage. We see a similar increase in intentions to return in the years around marriage for male migrants who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German, and their intentions to return remain high (about 87 % intend to return). In comparison, far fewer men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse intend to return throughout the 15 -year period (roughly 77 %).|$|R
50|$|In 2000, the 20th Century Fox Television {{produced}} a made-for-TV remake called How to <b>Marry</b> <b>a</b> Billionaire: A Christmas Tale.

5|$|Born {{into the}} nobility, de Bourgoing was educated at court and <b>married</b> <b>an</b> {{artillery}} officer, Joseph Fortoul. Widowed, after raising her children, de Bourgoing chose {{the field of}} nursing {{as a means of}} helping alleviate poverty and participated in the first formal nursing classes offered in Paris. After she began working as a nurse, she went abroad with the Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires, a forerunner of the French Red Cross, to work in North Africa. In 1907, she joined the SSBM and that same year, travelled to Morocco, where she established an infirmary in Casablanca. Fifteen months later, she assisted in disaster relief following an earthquake in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later <b>married</b> <b>an</b> ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Mike Delfino (James Denton) <b>married</b> <b>an</b> unidentified bride, who was either Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), his ex-wife, or Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), his fiancée and Susan's close friend. Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) learned that she and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), are expecting twins, two of what will be six children. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) agreed to take in his niece, Ana (Maiara Walsh), and she and Gabrielle began to antagonize one another. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) sought a divorce from her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan); however, Orson refused to end their marriage and blackmailed her into staying in the relationship. As a result, Bree began an affair with her divorce lawyer and Susan's ex-husband, Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi).|$|E
30|$|By contrast, Figure  2 {{depicts a}} much smaller {{difference}} {{in the proportion of}} migrants who send remittances and <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse rather than a non-German. Figure  2, panel a depicts an upward shift in the number of men who send remittances after marriage. The shift is especially large for men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse, among whom, few report sending remittances before marriage. Interestingly, more men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse remit before marriage than their counterparts who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German. But after marriage slightly more male migrants who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German remit. The number of women who remit is much more constant around marriage. Similar proportions of women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German and a non-German spouse send remittances until about three years after marriage, then many women who <b>married</b> <b>a</b> German spouse stop remitting. Observations for the year of marriage seem to be extremely noisy and are thus excluded from the analysis.|$|R

The marriage was allegedly set up by Bure's agents as a preventative measure against deportation in the event he and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract. Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage, which was dissolved the following year. Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry.|$|E
5|$|Hu Die {{retired in}} 1966, after a career {{spanning}} {{more than four}} decades. It was said that in 1967 she <b>married</b> <b>an</b> admirer named Zhu Fangkun (or Song Kunfang), who had given her financial support in the difficult period following Pan Yousheng's death. She emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975 to join her son. She lived a low-key life and avoided attention by using the name Pan Baojuan. She dictated her memoir in 1986, which first appeared in Taiwan's United Daily News in serials, and was published in mainland China in 1987. She died on 23 April 1989, after suffering a stroke.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the Returned and Services League (RSL), a {{veterans}} organisation, recommended Saunders {{for inclusion}} in the official Australian contingent to the coronation of Elizabeth II; the Federal government rejected the suggestion on the grounds that including Saunders would have meant excluding an officer who had been previously selected. Following his service in the Korean War, Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for national servicemen at Puckapunyal. Away from active service, however, he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged at his own request. The same year, he <b>married</b> <b>an</b> Irish nurse, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea.|$|E

5|$|Sitric <b>married</b> <b>an</b> unnamed {{sister of}} Æthelstan in 926. Historians {{generally}} describe her as Æthelstan's only full sister, but Maggie Bailey {{points out that}} this rests on the late testimony of William of Malmesbury, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no such distinction when recording her marriage to Sitric. William did not know her name, but traditions first recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century identify her as Saint Edith of Polesworth. The truth of his identification is debated, but regardless of her name {{it is likely that}} she entered a nunnery in widowhood. According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, Amlaíb Cuarán was the son of Sitric and this West Saxon princess.|$|E
5|$|The Vorontsov Palace was {{commissioned}} {{as a summer}} residence for the Governor-General of Novorossiya, Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (born 1782 – died 1856). The Prince was a dedicated Anglophile. His father, Semyon Vorontsov, had been Catherine the Great's ambassador to England, and the Prince had been educated in London. His sister, Catherine, had <b>married</b> <b>an</b> English aristocrat and become the châtelaine of one of England's grandest country houses, Wilton House. On the accession of Paul I, in 1796, Semyon Vorontsov fell from favour and his estates confiscated and not returned until 1801, after the accession of Alexander 1. It is therefore unsurprising that he chose to reside with his daughter in England until his death and that Mikhail Vorontsov was a frequent visitor to that country.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} of Dokeianos is {{considered}} to derive from Dokia in the Armeniac Theme. The family only came into prominence in the mid-11th century, with Michael {{one of the first}} to be mentioned. He is generally considered as the Dokeianos who <b>married</b> <b>an</b> unnamed daughter of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos and sister of the future emperor Isaac I Komnenos (reigned 1057–59), probably ca. 1030. Together, they had a son, Theodore Dokeianos. According to the near-contemporary official and historian John Skylitzes, Michael Dokeianos was a simple man and not suited for command, and according to the modern scholar Konstantinos Varzos he owed his rise to high office to his family ties with the Komnenoi. It is known that he was wealthy, and possessed estates in Paphlagonia, possibly adjacent or part of the Komnenos family estates in the same region.|$|E
