40|$|This is {{a notice}} of {{construction}} (NOC) application for thermal stabilization of plutonium in a polystyrene matrix (polycubes) in the <b>muffle</b> <b>furnaces</b> at the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP). This NOC application {{is required by}} Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 460 - 040. During the 1960 's and 1970 's, polycubes were thermally stabilized using a pyrolysis process at PFP. The proposed process of thermal stabilization of polycubes in <b>muffle</b> <b>furnaces</b> results in emissions of air contaminants not emitted since implementation of WAC 173 - 460 (effective 9 / 18 / 91).

The resulting plutonium oxides would be packaged to meet storage requirements specified in Stabilization, Packaging, and Storage of Plutonium Bearing Materials (DOE-STD- 3013). The PFP {{is located in the}} 200 West Area of the Hanford Site. The PFP consists of several large and small buildings that are grouped to form the processing complex. The PFP activities are focused on the stabilization of plutonium-bearing materials to a form suitable for long-term storage; immobilization of residual plutonium-bearing materials; and removal of readily retrievable, plutonium-bearing materials left behind in process equipment and process areas...|$|R

Finally, the solidified uranium metal (derby) was separated from the slag and liner materials in a sequence of manual and mechanical operations that {{take place at the}} breakout station.

For years, researchers {{have been looking for}} various ways to overcome the problems of such large quantities of waste plastics. On the other hand, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are materials with extraordinary physical and chemical properties which often have energy- and resource-intensive production processes. In recent years, some researchers have suggested the idea of using plastic polymers as the carbonaceous feed of CNT production. The studies undertaking such a feat are rather scattered. This review paper is {{the first of its kind}} reporting, compiling and reviewing these various processes. The production of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) from plastic polymers is seen to be satisfactorily achievable through a variety of different catalytic and thermal methods in autoclaves, quartz tube reactors, <b>muffle</b> <b>furnaces,</b> fluidized beds, amongst others. Still, much work needs to be done regarding the further investigation of the numerous parameters influencing production yields and qualities. For example, differences in results are seen in varying operating conditions, experimental setups, catalysts, and virgin or waste plastics being used as feeds. The area of producing CNTs from plastic wastes is still very open for further research, and seems as a promising route for both waste reduction, and the synthesis of value-added products such as carbon nanotubes. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The increased use of opportunity fuels and low emission combustion modes have aggravated the corrosion on boiler tube walls in power plants. Corrosion-induced equipment failure could lead to catastrophic damage and inflict significant loss of production and cost for repair. Monitoring fireside corrosion in a reliable and timely manner can provide significant benefits to the plant operation. Current corrosion inspection and measurement are typically performed during scheduled maintenance outages, which is often after the damage is done.

Gasification technology has a high potential for reducing biomass energy consumption whilst increasing access to modern energy services. The key aspect for the failure of gasification operations in the Lake Victoria Basin is inadequate adaptation of gasification equipment to fuel characteristics, lack of fuel specification and inappropriate material choice.

The aim of this work was to study the features of the luminescence and the effect of UV irradiation and heat treatment on luminescence and the state of cerium ions and antimony in glass. We investigated glass system Na 2 O-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -NaF-NaBr with additives CeO 2 and Sb 2 O 3. Synthesis was carried out in platinum crucibles in the air at 14500 C. The samples were polished glass plates with a thickness of 0. 5 - 1 mm. UV irradiation was carried out with a mercury lamp having a wide range of radiation in the spectral range 240 - 390 nm. It was conducted in a Nabertherm <b>muffle</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Luminescence spectra and excitation spectra were measured using a spectrofluorimeter MPF- 44 A (PerkinElmer) at the room temperature. Measured luminescence spectra were corrected in view of the spectral sensitivity of the photodetector for spectrofluorimeter. Adjustment of the excitation spectra for the spectral dependence of the intensity of the excitation source was not carried out. During the experiments it was found that in silicate glasses Sb 3 + ions can exist in two energy states, which corresponds to a different environment with oxygen ions. Heat treatment of these glasses in an oxidizing atmosphere leads to an increase in ion concentration of Sb 3 + ions with a greater amount of oxygen in the environment. In glasses containing antimony and cerium ions, ultraviolet irradiation causes a change in the valence of cerium ions and antimony, which is accompanied by luminescence quenching. Subsequent heat treatment of glass leads to the inverse processes and restore luminescence excitation spectra. The study of fluorescent properties of silicate glasses with cerium and antimony ions led to the conclusion of the practical significance of this work. Promising multifunctional materials can be created {{on the basis of these}} glasses that meet all the needs of modern photonics...|$|R
