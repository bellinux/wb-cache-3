50|$|On locomotives, these trucks {{may have}} two, three or {{possibly}} <b>four</b> <b>axles,</b> making the truck quite long. Such a long truck, particularly the three and <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> variants, {{makes it difficult}} for the wheels to go around curves. To solve this problem, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) designed the Radial Steering Truck. This design allows the wheels to pivot around the center of the curve somewhat, allowing less wear on the wheel flanges and rails.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the orders}} lacked for the GR12 {{due to the}} weight {{and size of the}} locomotive, EMD revised and {{designed}} the lighter G22 series model to accommodate the Flexicoil Type-C truck and introducing the new EMD 645 series engine. With relocation of the batteries within the carbody and increasing the fuel tank capacity, the G22C series was the same length to that of its <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> counterpart, the G22. Production spanned longer than the <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> G22 version, but with smaller orders.|$|R

40|$|A <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> {{aircraft}} {{is designed}} with the open source firmware MWC {{is used as}} the flight control board. The MPU 6050 gyro sensor and BMP 085 pressure sensor are used to acquire the attitude data of aircraft in real time. Combining the Calman filtering and mean filtering, the attitude data is filtered and fused to obtain more accurate attitude information. In the control algorithm, the PID control algorithm is adopted to control {{the speed of the}} motor, which ensures that the aircraft can quickly and stably change the attitude of the flight. The Android handset is connected to an aircraft by using the WiFi signal which is launched on the <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> aircraft. The user can control the aircraft by using the appropriate App. Experimental results show that: The <b>four</b> <b>axle</b> aircraft can realize the functions of attitude, heading and hover under the control of App, and the system has friendly interface, flexible operation, stable and reliable...|$|R
