Multiple existing methods are explored, discussed, {{and some new}} algorithms are introduced to allowvery accurate detection of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and surfacewater changes. Themethods range in applicability from the local level to global, and from detecting high-frequency changes to low-frequency changes. Their trade-offs regarding the accuracy and applicability of the <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> detection methods are also discussed. Several applications are presented to test the introduced methods. One of the studies focuses on a long-term global <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> change detection over the past 30 years at 30 m resolution. The other application looks at the generation of a permanent <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> mask for Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia. Additionally, an in-depth validation for a small reservoir in California, USA is presented, to demonstrate performance of the new methods. The algorithms discussed in the thesis were applied and tested to process both passive optical multispectral and active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. Combining data fromall freely available satellite sensors requires harmonizations of the satellite data, but also, significant computing resources.

40|$|Fourteen {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) were measured in <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> and precipitation inputs to Lake Maggiore, a subalpine lake in Northern Italy, from July 2003 to January 2004. Particulate and dissolved phases in <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and rain samples were determined. Analyses of PAHs were performed using XAD- 2 resin to isolate the dissolved PAHs and subsequent extraction by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Both the dissolved and particulate phase PAH patterns in <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and rainwater samples were dominated by the low molecular weight compounds (e. g., phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene). More than 85 % of PAHs in <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> and 72 % of PAHs in rainwater were associated to the dissolved phase. The RPAH concentrations in <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> (particulate and dissolved phases) were 0. 584 ± 0. 033 ng/l, 2. 9 ± 0. 312 ng/l and in rainwater (particulate and dissolved phases) 27. 5 ± 2 ng/l, 75. 4 ± 9 ng/l, respectively.

The {{purpose of this}} research was to investigate the water balance, flushing time, and water chemistry of Taylor Slough; one of the main natural waterways of the coastal Everglades, during its early stages of restoration. Both the water balance and flushing times were calculated on a monthly basis from 2001 to 2011. <b>Surface</b> <b>water</b> chemistry was analyzed using 3 -day composite samples collected every 18 h. Current restoration efforts have been able to increase <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> inputs to southern Taylor Slough, but rainfall was still the dominant water input.
