5|$|From 1965 through 1968, {{the war in}} the {{northeast}} followed the monsoon cycle, with dry season communist offensives followed by wet season Hmong (and later Thai) counteroffensives.

5|$|The {{beginning}} of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be {{more powerful than the}} two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.|$|E

25|$|The first {{identification}} of fossil {{content of the}} Cuche Formation was done by Botero, who studied the formation in 1950. Research in the early 1980s revealed the presence of many more fossils in the formation and among the first fossil flora found were species then identified as the genera Ginkgo and Baiera. The lower units show poorly preserved plant remains and the overlying shales provided arthropods and crustaceans. In the middle units of the formation, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> preserved plant fossils were found alongside bivalves, ostracods (of the genus Welleria) and arthropods.|$|E

25|$|The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, {{in which}} Spain settled a border dispute and ceded Florida to the United States, brought big changes to St. Augustine. The only {{city on the}} Florida peninsula, it became a {{destination}} for curiosity-seekers and consumptives on doctors' orders to escape cold northern winters. The presence of Castillo de San Marcos, a coquina fort built by the Spanish and now controlled by the U.S. military and renamed Fort Marion, brought a larger military presence to town. A decade after Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, the need for <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> visitor accommodations became pressing. Local residents began advertising rooms for rent with board (meals) included. This kind of lodging was in most cases a step above staying at a hotel.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Germans had <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> {{equipment}} for trench warfare, with good quality hand grenades, rifle grenades and trench mortars; the Germans made more effort to repair and improve defences {{and with a}} homogeneous army, {{found it easier to}} move artillery, ammunition and men along the front. A substantial cadre of the pre-war trained officers and conscripts remained, to lead the wartime recruits. British tunnellers achieved an ascendancy over their German equivalents but in ground operations, the number of operational machine-guns and the volume and accuracy of artillery fire, had more effect than individual skill and bravery; the quantity of heavy guns often determined the course of engagements. The success of a local attack left the victors vulnerable to a counter-attack and captured positions were often more costly to hold, than the previous positions.|$|E
25|$|A fourth line of defence was dug from Le Transloy to Ligny-Thilloy, a fifth one {{closer to}} Bapaume and work begun on a sixth line further east. Reverse slopes {{were chosen for}} the defences, to evade {{artillery}} fire directed by ground observers, which made more demands on Anglo-French air observation crews, {{during a period of}} rain and poor visibility. <b>More</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> German aircraft became available, which were used to challenge Anglo-French air superiority and a substantial amount of the German artillery at Verdun was brought to the Somme front. Despite ammunition shortages and inferior quality ammunition being supplied (caused by substitute materials being used in ammunition manufacture), more destructive fire was used to try to disrupt Allied infantry before they crossed no man's land, rather than continue with wasteful, unobserved area bombardments. The Anglo-French had made important gains of ground and inflicted many casualties on the German armies but their advance in the Morval area had been contained, leading to more mutually costly fighting in the Battle of Le Transloy (1 October – 5 November) in colder and wetter autumnal weather.|$|E

25|$|In early 1916, the Germans had an {{advantage}} in trench warfare equipment, being equipped with <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> hand grenades, rifle grenades and trench mortars. It was easier for the Germans to transfer troops, artillery and ammunition along the Western Front than the Franco-British, who had incompatible weapons and ammunition and a substantial cadre of German pre-war trained officers, NCOs and soldiers remained. The British wartime volunteers gained experience in minor tactics but success usually came from machine-guns and the accuracy and quantity of artillery support, not individual skill and bravery; in the air the RFC overcame the Fokker Scourge and underground, the BEF tunnellers overtook the Germans in technology and ambition. When the Bluff was captured, the British retook it; Mount Sorrel and Tor Top were retaken by the Canadians and British successes at St Eloi and Vimy Ridge were short-lived. Constant local fighting was costly but it enabled the mass of inexperienced British troops to gain experience, yet had the front been less densely occupied, more troops could have had more training; the wisdom of each policy was debated {{at the time and}} since.|$|E
25|$|May wrote that, when Hitler {{demanded a}} plan to invade France in September 1939, the German officer corps {{thought that it was}} foolhardy and {{discussed}} a coup d'état, only backing down when doubtful of the loyalty of the soldiers to them. With the deadline for the attack on France being postponed so often, OKH had time to revise Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) for an invasion over the Belgian Plain several times. In January 1940, Hitler came close to ordering the invasion but was prevented by bad weather. Until the Mechelen Incident in January forced a fundamental revision of Fall Gelb, the main effort (schwerpunkt) of the German army in Belgium would have been confronted by first-rate French and British forces, equipped with <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> tanks and with a great advantage in artillery. After the Mechelen Incident, OKH devised an alternative and hugely risky plan to make the invasion of Belgium a decoy, with the main effort switched to the Ardennes, to cross the Meuse and reach the Channel coast. May wrote that although the alternative plan was called the Manstein Plan, Guderian, Manstein, Rundstedt, Halder and Hitler had been equally important in its creation.|$|E
