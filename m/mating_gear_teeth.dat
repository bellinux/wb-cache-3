It is believed that this procedure will greatly extend both the range of applicability and the accuracy of gear contact stress analysis. Point load superposition is based upon fundamental solutions from the theory of elasticity. It is an iterative numerical procedure which has distinct advantages over the classical Hertz method, the finite element method, and over existing applications with the boundary element method. Specifically, friction and sliding effects, which are either excluded from or difficult to study with the classical methods, are routinely handled with the new procedure. Presented here are the basic theory and the algorithms. Several examples are given. Results {{are consistent with those}} of the classical theories. Applications to spur gears are discussed...|$|E

In the EV mode, however, jerk can be induced {{since there are}} insufficient damping elements in the drive-train. Though the jerk gives demoralizing influence upon driving comport, adding a physical damper is not applicable due to constraints of the layout. This study suggests the jerk reduction control, composed of active damping method and torque profiling method, to suppress the jerk without hardware modification. The former method creates a virtual damper by generating absorbing torque {{in the opposite direction}} of the oscillation. The latter method reduces impulse on the <b>mated</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> of the drive-train by limiting the gradient of traction torque when the direction of the torque is reversed. To validate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy, a series of vehicle tests are carried out and it is observed that the amplitude of the oscillation can be reduced by up to 83 %...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers, which treat the modelling of a spur gear set and a disc brake, and {{the interaction between the}} machine elements. Features of the performance are studied in relation to the initial stated assumptions. Initially, a method for analysing the influence of profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears was proposed. The contacts between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> were identified in the deformed state. In addition, artificial neural networks were employed for system identification. The discussion was focused upon the dependency between the contact ratio and the load in addition to the influence of profile and pitch errors. Experimental data validated the reliability of the approach. Following, a non-linear damping model for shaft torsional vibration studies was proposed and experimentally validated. The experiments showed that the internal shaft damping was highly non-linear. The damping tended to be not only stiffness related but also noticeably depended on the type of material. Friction induced noise due to the interaction of the mating teeth of a spur gear set was studied. For the shaft bearings, a non-linear damping model based upon the coefficient of restitution describing the interaction between the rolling elements and the inner- and outer race of the bearing was proposed. The non-linear support bearing model created a relation between the bearing stiffness in the path of contact of the mating teeth and the movement of the gears perpendicular to the path of contact. The presence of friction had its greatest effect upon the bearing force in the path of contact of the <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> at low angular velocities, and at mesh frequencies close to the natural frequency of the vibration perpendicular to the path of contact. Finally, the influence of the interaction between the disc of a floating disc brake assembly and connecting members was studied. In the initial process of the experimental research, high drag torque was acquired without applying force to the pads. The spline profile and the nave width were proven to have little effect upon drag, whilst the position on which the caliper was mounted had a considerable influence. Both the analytical study and the experimental measurements showed a strong correlation between the caliper position and the drag torque...|$|E
40|$|This Work Presents The Possibilities Of Percentage Of Reduction In The Root Fillet Stress Of Spur Gear By Introducing Circular Stress Relieving Feature Of Various Sizes At Different Locations. Two Categories Of Systematic Analyses Are Carried Out Using Finite Element Model Of Spur Gear. In The First Category Of Analyses Emphasize Is Given To Determine The Maximum Root Fillet Stress Which Is Required As Reference To Determine The Stress Reduction Factor. In Addition To This, The Effect Of Number Of Teeth, Pressure Angle, And Basic Parameters Of Rack Cutter On Root Fillet Stress Is Investigated. In Second Category Which Is The Prime Focus Of This Work; The Effect Of Introducing Geometric Stress Relief Feature Is Carried Out. Circular Stress Relief Feature Of Different Size At Strategic Locations On A Spur <b>Gear</b> <b>Tooth</b> Are Introduced. This Reduces The Root Fillet Stress. The Magnitude Of The Load Shared By A <b>Gear</b> <b>Tooth</b> Depends On The Position Of The Point Of Contact Of Teeth Engagement Along The Line Of Action. It Also Depends On Contact Ratio. High Contact Ratio Gear Teeth Pairs Are Subjected Low Load In Comparison Low Contact Ratio Gear For Transmitting Same Amount Of Torque. A Tooth Is Released From The Load As Soon As It Disengages With The <b>Mating</b> <b>Gear</b> <b>Tooth</b> And It Is Taken By The Next Conjugate <b>Tooth.</b> Therefore The <b>Gear</b> Teeth Are Subjected Varying (Fatigue) Load. If A Gear Fails By Bending Fatigue, The Failure Is Catastrophic And Occurs With Little Or No Warnings. The Maximum Root Fillet Tensile Stress Is One Of The Key Factors Which Determine The Fatigue Life Of The Gear. Therefore The Magnitude Of The Maximum Value Of The Root Fillet Tensile Stress Can Be Treated As The Index Of Fatigue Life Of Gear. Even Slight Reduction In Root Fillet Stress Leads To A Large Increase In Fatigue Life Of The Gears Designed For The Stress Level Above Endurance Limit. This Type Of Design Consideration Is Very Common, Where Safety And Light Weight Are The Principal Design Criteria.

In this study optical interferometry is used to determine distribution of lubricant film thickness. This work includes new and original results which clarify the studied problem. It was found that the direction of sliding velocity affects shape of the film at high speeds. This relates to the effect on heat flow through the contact.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{analysing}} {{the influence of}} profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears is proposed. The analysis is based upon a static, two-dimensional finite element approach. The contacts between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> are identified in the deformed state, and the nodal point density permits contact pressure distribution emulation for moderate to high load levels. In addition, artificial neural networks are employed for system identification in order to calculate load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness trends for low tooth load levels. The effect of tip relief on load-sharing properties is discussed. The contact force and the transmission error are simulated for two medium-quality spur gears where the profile and pitch errors are known. Experimental data validate {{the reliability of the}} approach. The contact ratio is shown to be highly load dependent due to profile and pitch errors. The discussion is focused upon the size of the area where the relation between torque and angular displacement is highly non-linear, i. e. load depending.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation for the dynamic response of high-contact-ratio spur gear transmissions is presented. High contact ratio gears {{have the potential}} to produce lower dynamic tooth loads and minimum root stress but they can be sensitive to tooth profile errors. The analysis presented examines various profile modifications under realistic loading conditions. The effect of these modifications on the dynamic load (force) between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> and the dynamic root stress is presented. Since the contact stress is dependent on the dynamic load, minimizing dynamic loads will also minimize contact stresses. It is shown that the combination of profile modification and the applied load (torque) carried by a gear system has a significant influence on gear dynamics. The ideal modification at one value of applied load will not be the best solution for a different load. High-contact-ratio gears were found to require less modification than standard low-contact-ratio gears. High-contact-ratio gears are more adversely affected by excess modification than by under modification. In addition, the optimal profile modification required to minimize the dynamic load (hence the contact stress) on a gear tooth differs from the optimal modification required to minimize the dynamic root (bending) stress. Computer simulation can help find the design tradeoffs to determine the best profile modification to satisfy the conflicting constraints of minimizing both the load and root stress in gears which must operate over a range of applied loads...|$|E

The main aim {{of the study was}} to establish an applicable practical means of measuring the amount of wear on gear tooth surfaces and to eventually integrate this metrology approach with finite element methodology for use in a maintenance strategy. Various methods found in the literature were reviewed. Due to the fact that the gears would only be available for periods when the draglines are serviced, the mould between two of the gear teeth seemed to be an appropriate suggestion. The mould would form the inverse of the gear tooth profile and be used for experimental tests. As certain detail was seen as confidential regarding the draglines, the study had to be done on a more available gear. A manageable size gear was donated for research by Reumech-Gear Ratio. The gear tooth profile as well as the mould were measured using a height gauge, and a gear-tooth calliper. The profile was also scanned by means of a digital scanner with a stylus gradually moving over the gear, and shown on a computer screen. The theoretical involute gear profile was generated and used as a reference to which the measured results could be compared by superimposing the profiles onto the reference gear profile. By comparing the measured results with the theoretical profile, it could be seen that both manual and automated results were within acceptable tolerance. Accuracy versus cost by comparison, therefore, would be the deciding factor. Further, the contact between two <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> was simulated using the finite element method. Gap elements were used to connect the nodes moving to one another. The finite element methodology could be used as a helpful maintenance instrument to link the measured gear wear to the equivalent stress levels during the different operational phases of the gear system. This could be a valuable means to manage gear life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Gear rattle is caused by engine torsional vibration (engine order response) imparted to the transmission components, further causing the gears to oscillate within their functional backlashes. These oscillations lead to the repetitive impact of gear teeth, which lead to noisy responses, referred to as gear rattle. The lack of in-depth research into the effect of lubricant on gear rattle {{has been identified as}} a deficiency in the previous research in rattle. The aim ofthe current work is to address this shortcoming. The thesis outlines a new approach in investigating the problem of idle gear rattle. The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that under idling condition the teeth-pair impact loads are sufficiently low and the gear speeds are sufficiently high to permit the formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant film between the <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth.</b> This film acts as a non-linear spring-damper that couples the driver and the driven gears. A torsional single-degree of freedom model is used in the development of the theory. The model is then expanded into a seven-degree of freedom torsional model and finally into an Il-degree of freedom model that also includes the lateral vibrations of the supporting shafts. The Il-degree of freedom model is based on a real life transmission that is also used in experimental studies to validate the model. It is found that lubricant viscosity and bearing clearance (lubricant resistance in squeeze) play important roles in determining the dynamics of the system and its propensity to rattle. At low temperatures, the lateral vibrations of the shafts, carrying the gears interfere with the gear teeth impact action. The severity of rattle is determined by the relationship between the entraining and squeeze film actions of the hydrodynamic film. When the latter dominates, the system can rattle more severely. The numerical results are found to correlate well with the experimental findings obtained from vehicle tests in a semi-anechoic chamber and also with those from a transmission test rig in the powertrain laboratory...|$|E

Often, by using these test machines real component contact conditions, such as the contact between <b>gear</b> <b>mating</b> <b>teeth,</b> are experimentally replicated. Gearboxes are mechanical transmission systems extensively used in the automotive and aeronautical industries. Several R&D activities are carried out {{around the world in}} order to improve the performances of these components. The main areas of R&D for these components are: design, materials and lubricants. Bespoke gear test rigs have been built in order to test innovative design of gears, new heat treatments, surface coatings and lubricants. These test systems can be grouped in three main groups (types) : Full scale gear box test systems, gear test systems and simplified (basic) test systems. Full scale gear-boxes development tests can be very expensive and generally such tests are carried out only at the very last stage of the development process and quite often only if product certification is required.

This paper proposes a numerically efficient and accurate contact model to calculate the contact locations and penetrations between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks by making use of the ease-off concept. The proposed approach exploits the fact that <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks {{are designed to be}} close-to-conjugate and can account for possible micro-modifications and relative motion between the meshing gear flanks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an extension to the ease-off based contact modeling which enables accounting for misalignments without the need to recalculate the ease-off topography for each new misaligned configuration. In a preprocessing step to the actual contact detection algorithm, the surface of roll angles and ease-off topography for a given gear pair under a given kinematic configuration are calculated, starting from a cloud-of-point representation of the different gears. The use of a cloud-of-point representation, combined with the knowledge of the surface normal vectors, allows for the analysis of different types of gears, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the created algorithm can account for different gear geometries, ranging from cylindrical gears to bevel and hypoid gears. status: publishe...|$|R

When a fault, either distributed or localised, is incurred by gears, the stiffness and consequently vibration characteristics of the damaged tooth will change. A possible non-destructive technique for damage detection and severity assessment {{can be derived from}} vibration analysis. This paper presents the use of vibration analysis in the detection, quantification, and advancement monitoring of damage incurred by spur <b>gear</b> <b>teeth.</b> The stiffness of a single spur <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> is analysed theoretically, and due to the difficulties in measuring the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> stiffness, an experimental procedure based on the modal analysis is developed to assess the severity of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> damage. A pair of spur gears was tested under accelerated wear conditions, and conventional time and frequency domain techniques are applied to the gear vibrations to indicate the presence and progression of the wear. The developed modal stiffness assessment technique is then used to quantify the resulting wear damage to the spur <b>gear</b> <b>teeth...</b>|$|R
