40|$|This study {{surveys the}} issue of <b>{{military}}</b> <b>coups</b> in Nigerian politics. An attempt is made to explain the causes of coups d'etat. To this end, Thompson's thesis of military grievances has been rigorously employed to explain the occurrences of <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> in Nigeria. The Thompson thesis asserts that coups occur because the military is aggrieved. A study of the opinions of expert observers familiar with Nigerian politics confirmed that four out of the six <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> occurred due to problems emanating from the Nigerian military establishment. Although military grievances such as its political positions, resource bases, ethnicity, and factions within the <b>military</b> caused most <b>coups,</b> there is sufficient evidence that societal factors like economic crises, election decisions, {{and the need for}} reforms also encouraged the military to overthrow governments in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|From a {{military}} standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held {{the upper hand}} during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the Carnation Revolution backed by portions {{of the military in}} Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's <b>military</b> <b>coup,</b> and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E

Political stability, verdicts devoid of justice, <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> and interventions, oligarchical bureaucratic structure, and terrorism are important factors assumed to be fixed. Although these factors may seem irrelevant at first glance, they have crucial impacts on economies. Important determinants of Turkey’s economic performance have been political decisions, the verdicts devoid of justice, in other words biased verdicts, <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> and interventions, oligarchical bureaucratic structure, and terrorism rather than economic policies. In this study, it is discussed that the effects of <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> and interventions on the performance of the economy in the context of Turkey example; and the hypothesis is validated within the framework of an econometric model...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the causes of}} <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> {{and the consequences of}} military rule in the Third World during the 1960 - 1985 period. Using a coup d" etat score, including both successful and unsuccessful coups, as a dependent variable and collecting data for 109 developing nations from the World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators, The New York Times Index, and public documents, sixteen hypotheses derived from the literature on the causes of <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> were tested by both simple and multiple regression models for the Third World as a whole, as well as for four regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa) and in two time periods (1960 - 1970 and 1971 - 1985). Similarly, three models of military rule (progressive, Huntington's, and revisionist models) were analyzed to assess the consequences of military rule. The results of the study concerning the causes of <b>military</b> <b>coups</b> suggest four conclusions. First, three independent variables (social mobilization, cultural homogeneity, and dominant ethnic groups in the society) have stabilizing consequences. Second, six independent variables (previous coup experience, social mobilization divided by political institutionalization, length of national independence, economic deterioration, internal war, and military dominance) have destabilizing consequences. Third, multiple regression models for each region are very useful; most models explain more than 50 % of the variance in <b>military</b> <b>coups.</b> Fourth, the time period covered is an important factor affecting explanations of the causes of <b>military</b> <b>coups.</b> In the analysis of the consequences of military rule, this study found that military governments did not differ significally from civilian governments in terms of economic, education, health, and social performances. However, the study found that military rule decreased political and civil rights. Its findings are thus very consistent with the best of the literature...|$|R
