However, the use of the built-in matrix functions within spreadsheet programs, such as Excel, is not particularly straightforward, lowering the value of spreadsheet programs for matrix-based computations, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analyses.</b> Therefore, this study first developed two applications for Excel to perform <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> in a much more user-friendly manner.

Vessel diameters were expressed as central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) and central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE). <b>Multiple</b> linear <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> and Cox <b>regression</b> models were used. Results. <b>Multiple</b> linear <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> showed that narrower CRAE {{was associated with}} higher systolic blood pressure, age, and higher HDL cholesterol, whereas wider CRAE and CRVE were associated with smoking. Narrower CRVE was associated with higher HDL cholesterol. In an age-adjusted model, associations between wider CRVE and risk of ischemic heart disease were found (P< 0. 001).

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of transdermal nicotine patches, subjects were a total of 118 adult male smokers, who were followed up for 12 months. Univariable logistic regression analysis and stepwise <b>multiple</b> logistic <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> were performed to identify the predictors of smoking cessation.

In the univariable logistic regression analysis, predictors of successful smoking cessation were the low consumption of cigarettes per day and the low Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores (p< 0. 05) at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. In the stepwise <b>multiple</b> logistic <b>regression</b> <b>analyses,</b> predictors of successful smoking cessation, which were different according to the follow-up periods, were found to be the low consumption of cigarettes per day at the short-term and midterm follow-up (≤ 6 months), older age, and the low consumptio...|$|R

Descriptive statistics were used to present the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension. <b>Multiple</b> logistic <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> were performed to examine the influence of socio-demographic and other variables on awareness and on current medication use. The results reveal that only 41 % of the total hypertensive persons were aware of their hypertension status, and only 59 % of them were on medication. Of those treated, only 5 % had controlled hypertension. <b>Multiple</b> logistic <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> reveal that gender, age, pulse rate and education were significantly associated with awareness of hypertension whereas age is the only significant factor associated with medication use. The Hosmer and Lemeshow tests for goodness of fit reveal that these regression models are a good fit. The study concludes that undiagnosed hypertension is considerable. Awareness, treatment and control of hypertension are not adequate among socioeconomically disadvantaged migrants.

40|$|The {{experience}} of cancer {{can be understood}} as a psychosocial transition, producing both positive and negative outcomes. Psychological adjustment to cancer is often impacted by a number of dispositional, coping process, and social-environmental factors. Social-cognitive processing theory provides a framework for understanding the interaction of these factors and examining the differential paths predicting positive and negative psychosocial outcomes. Fifty-five post-treatment, colorectal cancer survivors (M= 65. 9 years old; SD= 12. 7), an average of thirteen months post-diagnosis, were recruited from a state cancer registry and completed baseline and three-month questionnaires assessing dispositional (openness to experience, emotional intelligence, social desirability), social-environmental (social support, social constraints), coping process (cognitive intrusions, cognitive rehearsal, emotional approach coping), and psychological adjustment variables (posttraumatic growth (PTG), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, global mental health).

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the penetration and adaptation of two different sealant materials applied under different conditions of contamination using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Materials and Methods: A total of 56 extracted human third molar teeth were randomly assigned into eight equal groups. The treatment groups were defined by the combination of two sealant materials (glass ionomer fissure sealant "Fuji Triage" or resin-based fissure sealant "Clinpro TM") and four surface conditions (dry condition, water contamination, saliva contamination or saliva contamination and air-drying). Penetration depth, sealant adaptation and fissure types were evaluated under SEM after sectioning the teeth. Tukey′s test and <b>multiple</b> linear <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> were used for statistical analysis. Results: No significant difference in the sealant penetration and adaptation was found between both materials under dry conditions. However, under wet contaminations, resin-based sealant showed less adaptation and penetration with a significant difference when compared to glass ionomer sealant (P < 0. 05). The <b>multiple</b> linear <b>regression</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed significant impact of different materials and types of contamination on the sealant penetration and adaptation.
