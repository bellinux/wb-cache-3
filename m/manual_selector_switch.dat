50|$|Introduced in 1998, {{this made}} the {{distinction}} between uplink and normal ports and <b>manual</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> on older hubs and switches obsolete. If {{one or both of}} two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature, {{there is no need for}} crossover cables.|$|R
50|$|Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration is {{specified}} as {{an optional}} {{feature in the}} 1000BASE-T standard, meaning that straight-through cables will often work between gigabit-capable interfaces. This feature {{eliminates the need for}} crossover cables, making obsolete the uplink/normal ports and <b>manual</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a trigger {{assembly}} {{equipped with a}} <b>manual</b> fire control <b>selector</b> (the fire selector lever {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (<b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire selector lever also operates the external safety mechanism (lever in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|R

50|$|Tap changers {{typically}} use numerous tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> {{which may}} not be switched under load, broken into even and odd banks, and switch between the banks with a heavy-duty diverter switch which can switch between them under load. The result operates like a dual-clutch transmission, with the tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> taking the place of the gearbox and the diverter switch taking the place of the clutch.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{experts are}} {{concerned}} over the awkward {{position of the}} safety lever {{near the end of}} the rifle away from the shooter's hand. This position makes it difficult to quickly select [...] "fire" [...] when it is in [...] "safe" [...] mode. This is resolved on the [...] "G" [...] ("Gai", 改; literally: [...] "modified") variant (QBZ-95-1) where the fire <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> is repositioned above the pistol grip, giving it a thumb fire <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> for easy firing mode transition.|$|R

50|$|The Multimonica II {{featured}} no microphone input, {{and only}} one loudspeaker, but provided more types of harmonics filtering, and the electromechanic vibrato was changed to a tube based and more sophisticated design. The front panel controls of the Multimonica II {{from left to right}} are: power switch and overall volume knob; six <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for different preset sounds of the synthesizer; tuning knob; two <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for different harmonics filtering; three switches for the vibrato speed and amplitude; power switch for the blower fan.|$|R

2500|$|Access to {{the control}} panel was poor, as it was partly {{obstructed}} by an emergency pump for the aircraft's hydraulic equipment. The fire extinguisher control panel included <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for the co-pilot to select which of the four engines to douse with CO2. Investigators found that aboard KG867 the <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> for the port engines was in the [...] "off" [...] position and the selector for the starboard engines was switched to extinguish the inner starboard engine. This suggested that in the emergency, Warrant Officer Brož may have selected to extinguish the wrong engine by mistake.|$|R

The [...] "AZ" [...] (impact) setting triggers detonation when the bomb hits the ground. The fuze is armed if 4 screw threads {{at the base of}} the arming spindle are visible. This fuze is highly sensitive to disturbance if the <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> is set to [...] "Zeit" [...] and the bomb is unexploded. The particular switch setting of any type 41 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior.|$|R
50|$|Electronically, the Tele Deluxe also {{resembles the}} Gibson Les Paul - as both models have dual humbucking pickups, an upper-bout mounted 3-way pickup <b>selector</b> <b>switch,</b> and {{independent}} volume/tone controls {{for each individual}} pickup.|$|R
50|$|The SLAM has an {{anti-tamper}} {{feature that}} is only active in the bottom- and side-attack modes. The SLAM will detonate when an attempt is made to change the <b>selector</b> <b>switch's</b> position after arming.|$|R
