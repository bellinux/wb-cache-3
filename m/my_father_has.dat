2500|$|Phillips, {{a native}} of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood.

Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, [...] "I thank God every day for giving me a father who did the things he did for me... I've seen a lot of people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me. I always had a gym to go to. What <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> done has saved so many lives." ...|$|E
