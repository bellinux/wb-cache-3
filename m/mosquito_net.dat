The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts of garlic, probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net.</b> However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for more mundane purpose of avoiding the discomfort of mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E

This study determined the effect of adequate malaria knowledge and pregnancy status of women on use of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and reported malaria fever morbidity. The data were collected during the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) from 4632 women. Data analyses were carried out with descriptive statistics and Seemingly Unrelated Bivariate Probit regression. Results show that 13. 19 % of the women were pregnant, of which about one-third slept under <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets.</b> Also, 25. 26 % reported malaria associated fever in the previous two weeks to the time of interview, while 78. 28 % correctly answered that mosquitoes are responsible for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevention was low with 55. 70 % and 14. 93 % indicating sleeping under <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and ITN, respectively. Probability of sleeping under <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> significantly increased with knowing that sleeping under <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and ITN could prevent malaria while it decreased with having fever, age, urban residence and knowing that use of mosquito spray and coil can prevent malaria. The probability of having fever increased significantly with household size, being pregnant and age at first birth but decreased with age, knowing that sleeping under ITN, cutting grasses and closing door/windows would prevent malaria. Use of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> among the women was low. Also, efforts to enhance their knowledge on malaria prevention and ensuring adequate access to <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> especially for pregnant women would curtail the impact of malaria.

40|$|Abstract. A {{randomized}} controlled trial investigated {{the impact of}} community-wide use of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> im-pregnated with lambda-cyhalothrin alone or with dapsone/pyrimethamine (d/p) prophylaxis on clinical malaria due to perennially transmitted Plasmodium falciparum in children in the Bo district of Sierra Leone. The 17 study com-munities were pair-matched and randomly allocated to receive treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> or no nets and the children (age range 5 3 months– 6 years) in each community were randomly allocated to receive d/p or placebo individually every two weeks. This resulted {{in each of the}} approximately 2, 000 children recruited being in one of four study groups (impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and d/p prophylaxis, impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets,</b> d/p prophylaxis, and controls). The intervention phase of the study lasted 12 months. A total of 1, 800 children attended more than 25 % of the 48 total weekly morbidity surveillance surveys and were included in the analysis. The effects of the exclusive use of either treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> or d/p prophylaxis on protection against clinical malaria due to P. falciparum was significantly similar (49 % and 42 %, respectively), while in combination this protective efficacy was significantly increased to 72 % (95 % confidence interval 5 67 – 76 %). Children in the control group had an average of 1. 3 clinical malaria episodes per child annually compared with 0. 65 episodes or 0. 78 episodes for those using treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and d/p, respectively. Children using both treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and d/p prophylaxis had and average of 0. 37 episodes per child.

40|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{indicated}} that treating <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> with insecticide could be a potentially cost-effective method of preventing malaria. As malaria {{is one of the}} most common causes of death in children under five in developing countries, there has been substantial interest in whether such findings can be replicated for a country's control programme in practice. The cost-effectiveness of the Gambian National Insecticide-impregnated Bednet Programme (NIBP), from the viewpoint of providers (government and non-governmental agencies) and the community, has been calculated. Information was collected from existing records, interviews with NIBP personnel, observation and household surveys. Information is provided on the resource use consequences of the NIBP in terms of reduced expenditure on anti-malaria preventive measures, treatment in government health services, household financed treatment and "charity" (burial, funeral and mourning activities), as well as cash income lost as a result of child death. The annual implementation cost of the NIBP was D 757 875 (US$ 91 864), of which 86 % was recurrent cost. The estimated number of deaths averted was 40. 56. The net implementation cost-effectiveness ratio per death averted and discounted life years gained were D 3884 (US$ 471) and D 260 (US$ 31. 5), respectively. Adding the cost of all <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> would increase the cost-effectiveness ratios by over five times, which is an important consideration for countries with a lower coverage of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> per capita. It is concluded that insecticide-impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> are one of the more efficient ways of reducing deaths in children under 10 years in rural Gambia. malaria insecticide-impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> cost-effectiveness analysis...|$|R
