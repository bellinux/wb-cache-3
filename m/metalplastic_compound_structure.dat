As a special damping material, rubber has attracted great interest in the field of vibration and noise for its low Young’s modulus and high strain recovery features. Based on wave transfer propagation theory in infinite layered medium, sound absorption performance for underwater <b>compound</b> damping <b>structures</b> is investigated using transfer matrix method. A new anechoic coating containing different varying sectional cavities is proposed. Simulation results show that the new anechoic coating keeps good absorption performance in high frequency and its sound absorption coefficient is increased notably in low frequency. Simulations also show that the property of rubber material influences structural sound absorption greatly. Soft rubber as well as those with large loss factor may improve sound absorption performance of the whole structure remarkably. New anechoic coating containing varying sectional cavities have great advantages over the uniform <b>compound</b> <b>structures.</b> It's a good way to make different varying sectional cavities inside multi-layered rubber <b>compound</b> <b>structures</b> for improving sound absorption property. The sound absorption coefficient can be modulated by changing the thickness of the three different varying sectional cavities, and not the more the cavities are, the better sound absorption will achieve. As a new kind of complex multilayered rubber <b>compound</b> <b>structures,</b> <b>compound</b> <b>structure</b> containing varying sectional cavities has better sound absorption property than rubber interlayer with cylindrical cavities <b>compound</b> <b>structure</b> and homogeneous rubber <b>compound</b> <b>structure.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Computer Engineering and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2009. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2009. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 66 - 69 The {{common goal}} of object-based image analysis techniques {{in the literature}} is to partition the images into homogeneous regions and classify these regions. However, such homogeneous regions often correspond to very small details in very high spatial resolution images obtained from the new generation sensors. One interesting way of enabling the high-level understanding of the image content is to identify the image regions that are intrinsically heterogeneous. These image regions are comprised of primitive objects of many diverse types, and can also {{be referred to as}} <b>compound</b> <b>structures.</b> The detection of <b>compound</b> <b>structures</b> can be posed as a generalized segmentation or generalized texture detection problem, where the elements of interest are primitive objects instead of traditional case of pixels. Traditional segmentation methods extract regions with similar spectral content and texture models assume specific scale and orientation. Hence, they cannot handle the complexity of <b>compound</b> <b>structures</b> that consist of multiple regions with different spectral content and arbitrary scale and orientation. In this thesis, we present an unsupervised method for discovering <b>compound</b> image <b>structures</b> that are comprised of simpler primitive objects. An initial segmentation step produces image regions with homogeneous spectral content. Then, the segmentation is translated into a relational graph structure whose nodes correspond to the regions and the edges represent the relationships between these regions. We assume that the region objects that appear together frequently can be considered as strongly related. This relation is modeled using the transition frequencies between neighboring regions, and the significant relations are found as the modes of a probability distribution estimated using the features of these transitions. Furthermore, we expect that subgraphs that consist of groups of strongly related regions correspond to <b>compound</b> <b>structures.</b> Therefore, we employ two different procedures to discover the subgraphs in the constructed graph. During the first procedure the graph is discretized and a graph-based knowledge discovery algorithm is applied to find the repeating subgraphs. Even though a single subgraph does not exclusively correspond to a particular <b>compound</b> <b>structure,</b> different subgraphs constitute parts of different <b>compound</b> <b>structures.</b> Hence, we discover <b>compound</b> <b>structures</b> by clustering the histograms of the subgraph instances with sliding image windows. The second procedure involves graph segmentation by using normalized cuts. Since the distribution of significant relations within resulting subgraphs gives an idea about the nature of corresponding <b>compound</b> <b>structure,</b> the subgraphs are further grouped by clustering the histograms of the most significant relations. The proposed method was tested using an Ikonos image. Experiments show that the discovered image areas correspond to different high-level structures with heterogeneous content such as dense residential areas with high buildings, dense and sparse residential areas with low height buildings and fields.

In contrast to prior works (based on Al 99. 5) the goal of this paper is to apply the zincate treatment to different aluminum wrought alloys. This enables the possibility to create <b>compound</b> <b>structures</b> with enhanced mechanical properties. During zincate treatment the aluminum oxide layers are dissolved and a thin layer of zinc (< 500 nm) prevents reoxidation. Coating parameters are optimized especially for compound castings: maximum coverage of the surface and high coating adhesion implemented by double zincate treatment. The pretreated inserts are embedded in an aluminum component by high pressure die casting. A sound metallic bonding between both aluminum alloys develops due to diffusion and reaction zones. Mechanical tests confirm a sound metallic bonding. Depending on the integrated wrought alloy enhanced mechanical properties of the <b>compound</b> <b>structure</b> can be achieved.
