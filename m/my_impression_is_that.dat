500|$|The {{relative}} importance given {{to each of}} these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. [...] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. [...] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. [...] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: [...] "In most of their theologizing, however, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner." [...] In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E
2500|$|He {{describes}} it, {{near the}} Big Falls, about one {{hundred yards from}} the top of the mountain at Loup Creek, [...] "When I first saw it, fifty-eight years ago, it was in a much better state of preservation than it now is. At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable a half century ago. From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E

6000|$|It was Mr. Pike to the rescue. I {{understand}} now the Western hyperbole of [...] "hitting the high places."

Bill Quigley was kicked clear away from me, and the next moment he was flying overboard. It was a clean throw. He never touched the rail.|$|R

60|$|The Duke of Argyle {{said that}} Chevalier Bunsen had been {{speaking}} to him {{in relation to a}} college for colored people at Antigua, and inquired my views respecting the emigration of colored people from America to the West India islands. I told him <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Canada would <b>be</b> a much better place to develop the energies of the race. First, on account of its cold and bracing climate; second, because, having never been a slave state, the white population there are more thrifty and industrious, and of course the influence of such a community was better adapted to form thrift arid industry in the negro.|$|R

In 2013, {{he was arrested}} on drug delivery charges. “He had {{the opportunity for a}} new chance. It did not work out, though. That’s sad,” said Joseph Carroll, the former Chester County district attorney who dealt with Johnston Jr. in connection with his testimony against his father {{and other members of the}} gang. [...] “I think some of us felt bad for the guy,” added Carroll. “You grow up in that environment and what could your future <b>be?</b> <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> a victim of circumstance in where he grew up.“ He is currently serving a sentence of 7-14 years.|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Küntzel said he {{had given}} similar {{addresses}} (at Yale University, as well as universities in Jerusalem and Vienna) {{around the world and}} there had been no problems.

My feeling <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> a kind of censorship."Dr. Küntzel also said that the contents of emails described to him did not overtly threaten violence but [...] "they were very, very strongly worded". He added: [...] "It's stupid, because I also talk about Christian anti-semitism."

6000|$|... "Well, I {{believe that}} you would.

40|$|The {{first time}} I visited an American {{classroom}} I attended a statistics lesson in grade 5. When the teacher {{asked a question}} that sounded statistical but did not require a measure of center, a boy thoughtlessly muttered “meanmedianmode, ” as if it <b>were</b> one word. <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these students had been drilled to calculate mean, median, and mode, and to draw bar graphs, but did not use their common sense in answering questions. This small incident exemplifies what a litany of research in statistics education reports on: too often, students learn statistics {{as a set of}} techniques that they do not apply sensibly.

5000|$|It was by providential {{dispensation}} <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> able {{fully to}} understand the language and practical side of devotion after I had met the practicing master Kishora Das Babaji....No education could have prepared me for {{the good fortune of}} understanding my master's attitude....Before I met him <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the writings of the devotional school could not be fully realised in a practical life in this world. My study of my master, and then the study of the books, along with the explanations by Thakura Bhaktivinoda father Kedarnatha Datta, gave me ample facility to advance toward true spiritual life. Before I met my master, I had not written anything about real religion. Up to that time, my idea of religion was confined to books and to a strict ethical life, but that sort of life was found imperfect unless I came in touch with the practical side of things.|$|R
