50|$|Usually, a {{teratoma}} {{will contain}} no organs but rather {{one or more}} tissues normally found in organs such as the brain, thyroid, liver, and lung. Sometimes, the teratoma has within its capsule one or more fluid-filled cysts; when a large cyst occurs, {{there is a potential}} for the teratoma to produce a structure within the cyst that resembles a fetus. Because they are encapsulated, teratomas are usually benign, although several forms of <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> are known and some of these are common forms of teratoma. A mature teratoma is typically benign and found more commonly in women, while an immature teratoma is typically malignant and is more often found in men.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty six {{patients}} with advanced germ cell testicular tumours (38 seminomas and 108 malignant teratomas) treated by combination chemotherapy were studied over 10 years. Most of the improvement seen was {{in patients with}} <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> undifferentiated. In the most recently treated patients (1984 - 1987) 75 % of drug resistant cases were <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> intermediate compared with 26 % in the series treated between 1978 - 1983. The microscopic features of 52 primary testicular tumours were compared with features seen in excised retroperitoneal lymph nodes after completion of chemotherapy. Primary <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> intermediate had {{a higher incidence of}} viable malignancy in the excised tissue than <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> undifferentiated. Mature teratoma or fibronecrotic tissue within resected tissue was associated with a good prognosis. If resection was complete patients with drug resistant <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> intermediate had a more favourable prognosis than drug resistant <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> undifferentiated.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} specific for neurofilament proteins, glial filament protein, or myelin basic protein {{were used}} with immunohistochemistry {{for evaluation of}} a series of 14 human benign and <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> for the presence of these neural specific antigens. The results indicate that human teratomas can express all of these neural antigens, reflecting the presence of differentiated neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia, respectively. Although the tumors were selected because neural tissue had been noted on microscopic examination, 2 of the 15 cases lacked all of these neural antigens, and both were <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas.</b> In the remaining cases, 2 or 3 of these neural antigens were detected. The presence of all 3 was correlated with the presence of mature, and the absence of immature, neural elements.

Differences between survival curves were tested for statistical significance. A diameter greater than 5 cm in the largest tumour mass, and greater than 8 pulmonary metastases were adverse prognostic factors (P = 0. 004 and 0. 008 respectively). Patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma,</b> trophoblastic, fared worse than those with <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma,</b> undifferentiated, and <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma,</b> intermediate (P = 0. 011 and 0. 023 respectively).

40|$|The {{files of}} the Childhood Cancer Research Group and of the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers were {{scrutinized}} for all the ovarian neoplasms registered in England, Scotland and Wales in children under age 15 years throughout the period 1962 - 78. Among 172 cases confirmed as malignant ovarian tumours, 145 (84 %) were tumours of germ cell origin (54 dysgerminomas, 36 <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas,</b> 26 endodermal sinus tumours, 4 embryonal carcinomas, 2 pure choriocarcinomas, 20 mixed germ cell neoplasms, 3 gonadoblastomas), 13 (8 %) were epithelial carcinomas (3 serous or undifferentiated, 10 mucinous), 9 (5 %) were sex-cord stromal tumours (3 granulosa cell, 3 Sertoli-Leydig, 3 unclassified) and 5 (3 %) were other miscellaneous tumour types. Less than 10 % of the neoplasms occurred at age less than 5 years, approximately 20 % from 5 - 9, and greater than 70 % from 10 - 14 years. Germ cell neoplasms of greater malignancy (immature teratomas, endodermal sinus tumours) occurred in a significantly higher proportion at younger age (less than 10 years) than dysgerminomas (P = 0. 01). The overall incidence (approximately 1. 7 cases per 10 (6) per annum) did not show any noticeable trend over the 17 -year period considered. The clustering of two confined cases and, possibly, a third case, of germ cell neoplasms in three generations of the same family pointed to a genetic component in the aetiology {{of some of these}} neoplasms. A large number of sex related and mental or neurological abnormalities was also reported in case children. The 10 -year survival rates, determined by the life-table method were: epithelial carcinomas 73 %, sex-cord stromal tumours 44 %, dysgerminomas 73 %, <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> 33 %, endodermal sinus tumours 39 %, embryonal carcinomas 25 %, other germ cell neoplasms 30 % and gonadoblastomas 100 %. Apart from cell-type, factors associated with prognosis were clinical stage (in all types), size and degree of histological differentiation (in <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas,</b> but only when stage was not allowed for).

40|$|Background: Information on {{long-term}} follow-up {{of children and}} adolescents treated for intracerebral germ-cell tumour is scant. We report on the results of a small series of patients treated at a single institution. Patients and methods: Hospital records from 15 patients treated between 1980 and 1998 were reviewed. An attempt was made to correlate sequelae to tumour location and treatment modalities. Results: This cohort constitutes 5. 5 % of all brain tumours diagnosed at our institution. Histology: 10 germinomas, 2 benign <b>teratomas,</b> 2 <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas,</b> and one mixed germ-cell tumour. Overall survival was 87 %, with a mean follow-up time of 7 years and 8 months. The majority of patients have long-term sequelae involving one or several organ systems. In 66 % endocrine, in 47 % ophthalmologic, in 60 % neuropsycho-logical defects were observed. Endocrine and ophthalmologic sequelae show a correlation to tumour location. Neuropsycho-logical long-term abnormalities are frequent and are associated with cranial irradiation in particular at young age, but less with tumour location, irradiation dose or surgery. Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest that today intracerebral germinomas and mature teratomas have a good prognosis even when a relapse occurs. The outcome for mixed germ-cell tumours and <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> is less favourable. Although long-term sequelae are present in the majority of patients, {{there is some evidence that}} patients treated after 1990 suffer fewer severe long-term defects, thereby indicating that recent treatment protocols may result in a reduction of sequela...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. - To {{document}} the childhood teratomas at Tygerberg Hospital {{and compare the}} profile with other African series. Design. - Retrospective review of the clinicopathologic features of 43 cases of childhood teratomas. Tumors were classified according to the World Health Organization criteria for germ cell tumors. Setting. - Tygerberg Hospital, University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa. Results. - There were 26 mature, 15 immature, and 2 <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas.</b> The most common sites were the ovaries and the sacrococcygeal region. Testicular teratomas were absent. The female- to-male ratio for black patients was 5. 5 : 1. There was a peak age incidence in the first 4 years of life, with sacrococcygeal teratomas predominating. A second, smaller peak between 12 and 15 years was seen owing to ovarian teratomas. Immature teratomas presented {{at an earlier age}} than mature teratomas. The majority of ovarian teratomas occurred in patients of mixed race, whereas the extragonadal teratomas were distributed more evenly among the race groups. In black patients and patients of mixed race mature teratomas predominated, whereas in white patients immature teratomas were most common. Conclusions. - The increased occurrence of teratomas among female patients, the large number of ovarian teratomas, the absence of testicular teratomas, and the low incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> correspond to the observations of other African series. Certain differences are apparent among the three race groups, namely, a high ratio of female-to-male patients in the black group, a predominance of ovarian teratomas in the mixed-race and black groups, and a predominance of extragonadal and immature teratomas in the white group.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{cell line}} {{designated}} HUOT was established from a recurrent tumor of human ovarian <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma.</b> The cell line grew slowly and stably and serial passages were performed 50 times within 35 months. The cells, polygonal or spindle, with neoplastic and pleomorphic features grew in multiple layers and without contact inhibition. Population doubling time was 98 hours and the plating efficiency {{was less than}} 6 %. The chromosome number varied from 43 to over 256, and the modal number was stable at the hyperdiploid range (52 - 56). The cultured cells produced anaplastic carcinomas by heterotransplantation into the subcutis of nude mice and were characterized as producing large amounts of a-fetoprotein, in vitro, at the stationary growth phase and as forming cystlike structures. Dibutyl cAMP suppressed the cellular proliferation and increased the production of a-fetoprotein. Therefore, this HUOT line {{is expected to have}} a wide application for various laboratory studies. -JNCI 1985; 75 : 411 - 422. Ovarian <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> is a tumor of germ-cell origin with features such as AFP production (1 - 4). AFP is an oncofetal antigen produced by such tumors as liver cancer (5, 6), endodermal sinus tumor (2, 3, 7 - 9), <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> (2, 3), and gastric cancer (10); and AFP is useful as a tumor marker and an index for prescribing therapeutic agents and for determining tumor recurrences after surgical excision (4, 6, 11). Many of the cell lines of gonadal <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> originate in the testes (12, 13), whereas only 2 or 3 cell lines derived from the ovary have been reported (14, 15). We established an AFP-producing cell line (HUOT) from a recurrent tumor of ovarian <b>malignant</b> <b>teratoma</b> and examined the process of establishment and the properties of the cells. Particular attention was directed to the relationship between the AFP production and the proliferation and morphology of the cells...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} long-term outcomes of sacrococcygeal germ cell tumors (SC-GCTs) over a 15 -year period. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review was conducted of all pediatric patients treated for SC-GCTs at our hospital from 1998 to 2012. Results. Fifty-seven patients were treated for SC-GCTs with the most common in Altman’s classification type I. Age at surgery ranged from one day to 5. 6 years. Tumor resection and coccygectomy were primarily performed in about 84 % of the cases. Pathology revealed mature, immature, <b>malignant</b> sacrococcygeal <b>teratomas</b> (SCTs), and endodermal sinus tumors (ESTs) in 41 (72 %), 4 (77 %), 6 (10. 5 %), and 6 (10. 5 %), respectively. Recurrence of discase occurred in 3 of 41 patients with mature teratomas (7. 3 %); 2 recurrences with mature teratomas and one recurrence with EST. Five of 6 malignant SCTs and 3 of 6 ESTs responded well to the treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated in both <b>malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> and ESTs. No immediate patient death was noted in any of the 57 cases, but 4 patients with malignant tumors and distant metastasis succumbed at home within 2 years of the initial treatment. Conclusion.

25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most <b>teratomas</b> are benign. <b>Malignant</b> <b>teratomas</b> tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{morphological}} appearance, {{incidence and}} prognostic significance of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) -containing cells in seminomas {{were examined in}} a retrospective series of 228 orchidectomy specimens, obtained between 1958 and 1972. Sections from each tumour were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and immunocytochemically for HCG. In 33 (14. 5 %) of the tumours HCGcontaining cells were observed, but in only 12 were these recognised in an initial study of the H & E stained sections. HCG staining was seen predominantly in syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells and rarely in "mulberry" cells and mononuclear seminoma cells. Of the patients whose tumours included HCG-containing cells 23 % died of their disease within 2 years of orchidectomy, compared with only 8 % of the patients whose tumours lacked this feature. It is concluded that immunocytochemical staining for HCG should form part of the routine histological assessment of seminomas, and {{that the presence of}} HCG-containing cells indicates a more aggressive disease.

Centromeric heteromorphisms that were heterozygous in the host were homozygous in 65. 2 % (n = 58) of the benign teratomas and heterozygous in the remaining 34. 8 % (n = 31). Chromosome 13 heteromorphisms were the most informative, with 72. 7 % heterozygosity in hosts. The cytogenetic data indicate that 65 % of teratomas are derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I and failure of meiosis II (type II) or endoreduplication of a mature ovum (type III); 35 % arise by failure of meiosis I (type I) or mitotic division of premeiotic germ cells (type IV) ...|$|R
