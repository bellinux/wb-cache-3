40|$|This {{memorandum}} describes {{our findings}} {{in regards to}} the need for mitigation of <b>methidathion,</b> an agricultural miticide and insecticide. In 1985, DPR placed <b>methidathion</b> on the high-priority list for risk assessment pursuant to the Birth Defect Prevention Act of 1984 (DPR 1997). In 2001, DPR’s <b>Methidathion</b> Risk Characterization Document (RCD) concluded that, for the general public exposed to <b>methidathion</b> via food and drinking water, exposure was well below levels of concern for acute, subchronic, and chronic exposures (Lewis 2001). Margins of exposure (MOE) were at least 280, substantially more protective than the desirable MOE of 100 (Lewis 2001). However, the RCD estimated the carcinogenic risk from combined dietary and drinking-water exposure as ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 9 excess cancer cases in a million people. This estimate exceeds the risk level that is often considered acceptable, which is 1 excess cancer case in a million people (Lewis 2001). <b>Methidathion</b> exposure has been mitigated by the 2010 order from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA), accepting the registrants ’ voluntary cancellation of all <b>methidathion</b> products registered for use in the United States (Keigwin 2010). The U.

40|$|A cost {{effective}} method of decomposition {{was developed for}} industrial effluents by using ultrasound in combination of H 2 O 2. The process was optimized by studying the decomposition of <b>methidathion</b> pesticide at different frequencies, different ultrasonic wave amplitudes, pH and concentrations of the solutions. It was shown {{that the rate of}} sonochemical decomposition was directly linked to the OH ° availability in the solution. The degradation was more efficient for the higher frequency because the rates of OH ° formation in water saturated with air were more at higher frequency. It was observed that higher the ultrasonic frequency, higher was the energy consumption. This problem of higher energy consumption was resolved by increasing the concentration of H 2 O 2. Ultrasound/H 2 O 2 process gave better decomposition than ultrasound alone. Decomposition of <b>methidathion</b> was effective with ultrasound at greater sound wave amplitude. When the pH was controlled below the pk value of <b>methidathion,</b> significantly better decomposition of <b>methidathion</b> resulted.

40|$|Abstract. Separation of six organophosphorus {{pesticides}} (mevinphos, <b>methidathion,</b> diazinon, profenofos, quinalphos and chlorpyrifos) {{has been}} investigated using micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with on-column UV-Vis detection. Separations involved using anionic sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant and phosphate or borate buffer as carrier electrolytes. Separations have been found incomplete regardless of changing all sort of possible factors such as buffer types, buffer and surfactant concentrations, addition of organic modifier, methanol and pH of the running buffer.

40|$|Although <b>methidathion</b> is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide, it {{is different}} from the other organophosphates in terms of toxicity. Because of its relatively high fat solubility, the apparent volume of <b>methidathion</b> distribution throughout the body is very high, indicating that hemoperfusion is not effective in removing this organophosphate from the body. Redistribution of <b>methidathion</b> from fat to blood can also occur when plasma levels diminish. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase aging, which is the loss of an alkyl side chain that prevents reactivation by oximes, is very rapid so that the effective reactivation by oximes is thwarted. Thus, methidathion’s effect on acetylcholinesterase inhibition is long lasting, particularly with a high dose. In addition to its parasympatholytic effect and ability to induce muscle paralysis, <b>methidathion</b> poisoning is associated with a profound and long-lasting circulatory collapse due to sympathetic ganglion blockade. This report presents the case of a 55 -year-old man who accidentally ingested a high dose of <b>methidathion.</b> He later developed enteroinvasive aspergillosis infection-induced multiple bowel perforations on two separate occasions while on mechanical ventilator support, resulting in a fatal outcome. The renin-angiotensin axis activated by sympathetic ganglion blockade may have reduced the patient’s splanchnic blood flow, contributing to translocation of endotoxin.

The first compared three rates of nematode infective juveniles plus a nonionic surfactant with three rates of petroleum spray oil, three rates of fenoxycarb, and single rates of <b>methidathion</b> and permethrin. The second compared three rates of infective juveniles plus nonionic surfactant with the same three rates of infective juveniles plus a polysaccharide and petroleum spray oil mixture, three rates of fenoxycarb plus petroleum spray oil, and single rates of <b>methidathion</b> and fenoxycarb. Larval mortalities caused by <b>methidathion,</b> permethrin, {{the highest rate of}} the nematode, and the two higher rates of fenoxycarb in the first experiment were all significantly higher than the control, with permethrin the most effective treatment. The effect of oil on mortality was ambiguous, and the percentage of mined leaves in all sprayed treatments did not differ significantly from the control.

However, {{with the exception of the}} nematode/surt'actant and <b>methidathion</b> treatments, the number of mines per leaf in all sprayed treatments was significantly lower than in the control. Similar differences were recorded for percentage of mined leaves. In the nematode/polysaccharide/oil treatments these effects were not related to nematode concentration indicating a controlling effect of the polysaccharide/oil mixture warranting further investigation.

40|$|Abstract: Mealybugs {{are serious}} insect pests in Tunisian {{vineyards}} {{where they can}} cause major production losses. Thus, a manage-ment program of these insects is a priority for grape growers. A summer pesticide trial was conducted in a vineyard, located in the Cap-Bon Region of Tunisia. The trial was carried out to assess the use of imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide, against mealybugs on vine. Imidacloprid was applied through the drip irrigation system for each vine and was then compared to <b>methidathion,</b> a contact insecticide. Imidacloprid {{was found to be}} more effective than <b>methidathion</b> on all mealybug developmental stages. In addition to its outstanding, up to 100 % efficiency, imidacloprid provided an interesting long-term control of mealybugs. No significant difference was found between the two imidacloprid rates (1 and 2 ml/vine). <b>Methidathion</b> generated an overall low to intermediate efficacy on mealybugs and was more effective on both first instar nymphs and adult females than on the other mealybug developmental stages. Thus, imidacloprid applied through a drip irrigation system is a new promising option to control mealybugs in vineyards.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{disappearance of}} four organophosphorous insecticides in a Mediterranean calcareous soil was evaluated {{in the presence}} of surfactant solutions and municipal wastewater. A cationic, an anionic and a non-ionic surfactant were used at a low (0. 75 mg L(- 1)) and at a high (twice the critical micelle concentration) concentration level. The cationic surfactant was also studied at a higher concentration. Dissipation in control soil was rapid for malathion (half-life 4 days), intermediate for dimethoate and <b>methidathion</b> (ca. 6 days) and slow for diazinon (29 days). Wastewater did either not modify (diazinon, dimethoate and <b>methidathion)</b> or slightly enhance (malathion) insecticide decay. The increase in concentration of the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 resulted in enhanced dissipation rates for all the pesticides except diazinon. The addition of the anionic surfactant did not show a clear trend. At the highest cationic surfactant concentration a reduction of pesticide disappearance occurred linked with a reduced availability, since the insecticides were retained on the surfactant-modified soil (final residual concentration of 85 % for diazinon and approximately 55 % for <b>methidathion</b> and dimethoate). Soil microbial activity, estimated by measuring dehydrogenase activity, was low in wastewater- and surfactant-treated soil at the high levels.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} assess the toxicity of the pesticides abamectin 18 CE (0. 02 g a. i. L- 1), carbaryl 480 SC (1. 73 g a. i. L- 1), sulfur 800 GrDA (4. 8 g a. i. L- 1), fenitrothion 500 CE (0. 75 g a. i. L- 1), <b>methidathion</b> 400 CE (0. 4 g a. i. L- 1), and trichlorfon 500 SC (1. 5 g a. i. L- 1) as applied in integrated apple production in Brazil on the survival, oviposition capacity, and egg viability of the lacewing, Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) from Bento Gonçalves and Vacaria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. An {{attempt was made to}} study morphological changes caused by some of these chemicals, by means of ultrastructural analysis, using a scanning electronic microscope. Carbaryl, fenitrothion, and <b>methidathion</b> caused 100 % adult mortality for both populations, avoiding evaluation of pesticides' effects on predator reproductive parameters. Abamectin and sulfur also affected the survival of these individuals with mortality rates of 10 % and 6. 7 %, respectively, for adults from Bento Gonçalves, and were harmless to those from Vacaria at the end of evaluation. Trichlorfon was also harmless to adults from both populations. No compound reduced oviposition capacity. C. externa from Vacaria presented higher reproductive potential than those from Bento Gonçalves. In relation to egg viability, sulfur was the most damaging compound to both populations of C. externa. Ultrastructural analyses showed morphological changes in the micropyle and the chorion of eggs laid by C. externa treated with either abamectin or sulfur. The treatment may have influenced the fertilization of C. externa eggs and embryonic development. Sulfur was responsible for malformations in the end region of the abdomen and genitals of treated females. When applied to adults, abamectin, sulfur, and trichlorfon were harmless, while carbaryl, fenitrothion, and <b>methidathion</b> were harmful, according to the IOBC classification...|$|E
