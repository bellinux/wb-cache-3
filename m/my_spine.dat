The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
500|$|White {{was willing}} to print a variety of fiction, with {{traditional}} stories side-by-side with more experimental material that {{was influenced by the}} British New Wave or by 1960s psychedelia. In 1971 he serialized Ursula K. Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven, about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer who was influenced by this was James Tiptree, Jr., who later wrote that [...] "after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 Amazing in which Lathe came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> hair stood up." [...] White's willingness to experiment led to Amazing running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own [...] "Growing Up Fast in the City", was criticized as pornographic by some of Amazings readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's [...] "Two of a Kind", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White also printed more conventional fiction, however, much of it of high quality. The magazine was nominated for the Hugo award (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character.

6000|$|The {{sensations of}} a {{drowning}} man {{have been so}} often related that I shall only briefly explain that memory at once displayed her treasures: all the scenes of my eventful life crowded, though without confusion or fighting, into my mind.

There were the cradle in which I had lain, as a child, stupefied with soothing syrups; the perambulator, seated in which and propelled from behind, I overthrew the schoolmaster, and in which <b>my</b> infantile <b>spine</b> received its curvature; the nursery-maid, surrendering her lips alternately to me and the gardener; the old home of my youth, with the ivy and the mortgage on it; my eldest brother, who by will succeeded to the family debts; my sister, who ran away with the Count von Pretzel, coachman to a most respectable New York family; my mother, standing in the attitude of a saint, pressing with both hands her prayer-book against the patent palpitators from Madame Fahertini's; my venerable father, sitting in his chimney corner, his silvered head bowed upon his breast, his withered hands crossed patiently in his lap, waiting with Christian resignation for death, and drunk as a lord--all this, and much more, came before my mind's eye, and there was no charge for admission to the show. Then there was a ringing sound in my ears, my senses swam better than I could, and as I sank down, down, through fathomless depths, the amber light falling through the water above my head failed and darkened into blackness. Suddenly my feet struck something firm--it was the bottom. Thank heaven, I was saved! ...|$|R
5000|$|Years {{later she}} {{described}} {{her relationship with}} her mother as complicated, saying she [...] "hasn't hugged her mother since she was 12 and can't see it ever happening". However, later she gave much credit to her parents. [...] "I've never gone hungry. I never suffered lack of money in any way. Not because of my parents, anyway. They wanted the best for me, like all parents do for their children. They wanted me to have a very good education, to be a polite child, to be taught good manners and have a future", she recalled in 1980. Willcox remembered that until aged seven she was very close to her mother, if only for being very ill and having to be taught how to walk and talk. Then Barbara had another child, a daughter called Fleur, who died. [...] "When she came home from hospital {{there was a bit of}} a distance between us. It was never talked about again", Willcox remembered. At the launch of her autobiography in 2000, the singer said: [...] "We had a very violent relationship together. I was the violent person. And I didn't want her to kind of suffer by the book and I hope I represented her very well. Coz she really was a wonderful woman with a child from 'hell'." [...] In another interview of the time, Willcox said: [...] "My mother taught me how to walk, she was one that was trained to give me the physiotherapy to straighten <b>my</b> own <b>spine</b> so twice a day we would go through this routine. So she was disciplinarian in my life from a very - well right from when I can remember. So it was natural she was the first person I should rebel against.

40|$|Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is {{the leading}} {{inherited}} cause of mental retardation, and the most common identified genetic cause of autism. Although many phenotypes {{have been associated with}} the disorder, arguably the most well-studied and interesting is a pattern of dendritic spine “dysgenesis”, found in patients and animal models of the disorder. Specifically, dendritic spines, thorn-like protrusions associated with synapses, appear “immature”: often exhibiting abnormal length and shape, and found in higher than typical density in many brain regions. The phenotype described is consistent with the hypothesis that deficient synaptic pruning results in the observed spine phenotype. However, directly testing this hypothesis is not possible using traditional methods because the history and fate of particular spines is unknown. Through the use of repeated in vivo imaging using 2 -photon microscopy I was able to track the fate of individual spines over different periods of development on layer V dendritic tufts. Spine turnover, including both the formation of new spines and the elimination of existing spines, is enhanced in the Fmr 1 knockout (KO) animals compared with wildtype (WT) controls. Furthermore, the increased population of transient spines in the KO mice are not sensitive to modulation by sensory experience, such as by chessboard whisker trimming. Newly formed and eliminated spines were found to be more immature appearing compared to stable spines, suggesting that these spines could contribute to the abnormal spine profile described in Fragile X. However, multiple experiments showed KO spines from the layer V dendritic tufts do not display the spine phenotype previously described for this region of neocortex. Instead, <b>my</b> analysis of <b>spine</b> morphology and dynamics in this region suggests that morphology and size are strong predictors of instability, but that in the KO mouse, there is some dysregulation of this relationship. Using lithium, a model pharmacological treatment for Fragile X, I was able to demonstrate that the dynamic, in vivo spine phenotype can be modulated in both WT and KO mice. Lithium caused increased turnover of spines, and may specifically lead to more elimination of spines in the Fmr 1 KO in some contexts, potentially explaining the phenotypic rescue described for this drug in the literature. Finally, in order to test whether the spine phenotype could be modified in adult animals, I used recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) to induce reexpression of FMRP in the brain. Analysis by Golgi staining showed that expression of FMRP altered the spine phenotype towards a profile resembling the phenotype in WT animals injected with control vector. Together, these findings support a dynamic model of the dendritic spine phenotype that is responsive to the current environment and context, rather than being subject to developmental constraints. This novel dynamic spine phenotype observed in Fragile X mice, including an increased population of labile dendritic spines and abnormal responsiveness to sensory modulation, will be an important target for pharmacological (or gene replacement) rescue, as it may represent the capacity and proclivity of the network to learn and change...|$|R
