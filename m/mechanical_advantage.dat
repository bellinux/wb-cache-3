5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage,</b> allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> of {{the brake}} lever must be matched to the brake it is {{connected}} to {{in order for the}} rider to have sufficient leverage and travel to actuate the brake. Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> and hence not enough travel to properly actuate the brake (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage,</b> requiring a very strong pull to apply the brakes hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).|$|E

25|$|For {{a bicycle}} to travel {{at the same}} speed, using a lower gear (larger <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage)</b> {{requires}} the rider to pedal at a faster cadence, but with less force. Conversely, a higher gear (smaller <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage)</b> provides a higher speed for a given cadence, but requires the rider to exert greater force. Different cyclists may have different preferences for cadence and pedaling force. Prolonged exertion of too much force in too high a gear at too low a cadence can increase the chance of knee damage; cadence above 100 rpm becomes less effective after short bursts, as during a sprint.|$|E

25|$|Increases in {{the control}} surface area {{required}} by large aircraft or higher loads caused by high airspeeds in small aircraft lead to a large increase in the forces needed to move them, consequently complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> {{in order to reduce}} the forces required from the pilots.

25|$|Crushers {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the size, or change the form, of waste {{materials}} so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or {{to reduce the size of}} a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. Querns and mortars are types of these crushing devices.|$|E

40|$|For {{aerospace}} related electric systems, torque/force density, {{reliability and}} fault tolerance {{are of the}} utmost importance. A method by which high figures of reliability can be achieved is by eliminating any mechanical gearing or interconnection elements between the electrical machine and its mechanical load. This means that direct drive, electrical machines must be employed. However, to implement such solutions (without any <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantages),</b> electrical machines with excellent torque density (for rotational machines) and force density (for linear machines) performances are required. In this work, the main aim is to propose and investigate possible methods for extending and improving the torque/force density capabilities of high performance, state of the art, electrical machines (both rotational and linear). This is done {{in order to be}} able to meet the performance requirements while lacking the <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantages</b> synonymous with gearing and/or mechanical interconnections. Novel electro-magnetic and thermal management structures, detailed design and optimisation procedures for electrical machines are presented in this thesis. As vehicles to investigate these novel concepts, a tubular linear, permanent magnet motor and a rotational, synchronous permanent magnet motor are designed, built and experimentally tested.

500|$|The {{mechanical}} {{analogy of}} a transformer {{is a simple}} machine such as a pulley or a lever.

500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage</b> over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E
500|$|Past studies {{proposed}} {{that changes in}} dire wolf body size correlated with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dire wolf craniodental morphology from four LaBrea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results are evidence {{of a change in}} dire wolf size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape, and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm Allerød oscillation. Evidence of food stress (food scarcity leading to lower nutrient intake) is seen in smaller body size, skulls with a larger cranial base and shorter snout (shape neoteny and size neoteny), and more tooth breakage and wear. Dire wolves dated 17,900YBP showed all of these features, which indicates food stress. Dire wolves dated 28,000YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was {{proposed that}} these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier than this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantage.</b> North American climate records reveal cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called Dansgaard–Oeschger events. These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at LaBrea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with the gray wolf, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust, and possibly convergent with the dire wolf, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{relative}} weight of the drive shaft, the transmission was normally split into two parts: the gearbox and the final drive. The gearbox was normally produced with its highest gear being 1:1, which offers some <b>mechanical</b> <b>advantages.</b> The final drive, in the rear axle, would then reduce this to the most appropriate speed for the wheels. As power is the product of torque and angular velocity, spinning the shaft faster for any given power reduces the torque and allows a lighter shaft construction.|$|R
