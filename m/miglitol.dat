50|$|Even {{though the}} drugs {{have a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and <b>miglitol.</b> Acarbose is an oligosaccharide, whereas <b>miglitol</b> resembles a monosaccharide. <b>Miglitol</b> is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose. Moreover, acarbose inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to alpha-glucosidase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miglitol,</b> {{and other}} structurally-related iminosugars, inhibit {{glycoside}} hydrolase enzymes called alpha-glucosidases. Since <b>miglitol</b> works by preventing digestion of carbohydrates, it lowers {{the degree of}} postprandial hyperglycemia. It must be taken {{at the start of}} main meals to have maximal effect. Its effect will depend on the amount of non-monosaccharide carbohydrates in a person's diet.|$|E

50|$|Many {{compounds}} {{are known}} that can act to inhibit {{the action of}} a glycoside hydrolase.

From these natural templates many other inhibitors have been developed, including isofagomine and deoxygalactonojirimycin, and various unsaturated compounds such as PUGNAc. Inhibitors that are in clinical use include the anti-diabetic drugs acarbose and <b>miglitol,</b> and the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Some proteins have been found to act as glycoside hydrolase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{biochemical}} activity for medicinal applications, DNJ and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB, another early {{example of this}} class of compounds) are alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and were shown to have anti-diabetic and anti-viral activity. DNJ was modified to produce two derivatives now used as medicines, N-hydroxyethyl-DNJ (<b>miglitol)</b> for diabetes and N-butyl-DNJ (miglustat) for Gaucher's disease. Anti-cancer and anti-viral activity was subsequently observed for swainsonine—a mannose analogue—and castanospermine—a glucose analogue—in the 1980s. More than 200 have now been reported from plants and micro-organisms. Although the early compounds had biological activities due to glycosidase inhibition, an increasing number are being shown to have therapeutic potential without being glycosidase inhibitors and may interact with sugar receptors in the body or chaperone deficient enzymes such as in lysosomal storage disorders or in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

However, its influence on platelet activation markers (PDMP and soluble CD 40 ligand [sCD 40 L]), selectins, and adiponectin in these patients is poorly understood. Aim: We investigated the effect of <b>miglitol</b> on circulating levels of PDMP, sCD 40 L, selectins, and adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: <b>Miglitol</b> (150 mg/day) was administered for 4 months. Levels of PDMP, sCD 40 L, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin), and adiponectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, and after 1 and 4 months of treatment. Results: The levels of PDMP, sCD 40 L, sP-selectin, sE-selectin, and sL-selectin were higher in diabetic patients than in hypertensive patients, while there were no significant differences between hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients. Before <b>miglitol</b> treatment, the adiponectin level of diabetic patients was lower than that of hypertensive patients. <b>Miglitol</b> therapy significantly decreased the plasma PDMP and sCD 40 L levels relative to baseline. <b>Miglitol</b> also caused a significant decrease of sP-selectin, sE-selectin, and sL-selectin.

40|$|Abstract Background Glucose {{fluctuations}} including robust postprandial hyperglycemia are a {{risk for}} promoting atherosclerosis and diabetic complications. The α-glucosidase inhibitors and the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors {{have been found}} to effectively decrease postprandial hyperglycemia independently. Therefore, glycemic control with the combination of these drugs is warranted. Methods Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed for 3 patients with type 2 diabetes and 1 control subject from the beginning {{to the end of the}} study. Medications were not administered to any of the subjects on the first day of the study. From the second day to the end of study (days 2 - 5), the subjects received <b>miglitol</b> (150 mg per day) and on days 4 and 5, sitagliptin (50 mg per day) was added to the treatment regimen. On the first, third, and fifth days of the study, blood was drawn at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after breakfast for measurements of serum insulin, 1, 5 -anhydroglucitol (1, 5 -AG), plasma glucagon, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Results Measurements of CGM and 1, 5 -AG levels showed that <b>miglitol</b> attenuated the escalation and fluctuation of glucose levels, and this was even more pronounced with the combination of <b>miglitol</b> and sitagliptin. The patterns of insulin secretion and glucagon secretion with <b>miglitol</b> alone or with a combination of <b>miglitol</b> and sitagliptin were various in the study subjects. <b>Miglitol</b> alone enhanced the release of GLP- 1 in 1 patient with type 2 diabetes and the control subject, whereas the combination of <b>miglitol</b> and sitagliptin increased GLP- 1 levels to varying degrees in all the subjects. Except for 1 subject, none of the subjects showed any change in GIP levels after the addition of sitagliptin, compared to the administration of <b>miglitol</b> alone. Conclusions In conclusion, CGM measurements revealed that a combination of the α-GI <b>miglitol</b> and the DPP- 4 inhibitor sitagliptin effectively reduced postprandial glucose fluctuation and stabilized blood glucose levels.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comBackground: Previous studies reported that administration of first generation α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), such as voglibose or acarbose, produced exaggerated and sustained postprandial responses of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), an incretin hormone from the enteroinsular axis, in healthy humans. Little {{is known about the}} postprandial release of GLP- 1 after AGI therapy in diabetics. GLP- 1 plays a role to mediate satiety. Any agent that substantially elevates GLP- 1 levels may theoretically reduce hunger, increase satiation and limit food intake. Objectives: This study was performed to analyse the effect of <b>miglitol,</b> a more potent second generation AGI with fewer gastrointestinal side-effects, on the regulation of meal-related GLP- 1 secretion and on the change of insulin–glucose dynamics as well as the release of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), another incretin hormone, after stimulation by an ordinary meal in obese type- 2 -diabetic subjects. Miglitol's subsequent influences on appetite sensations and food intake were also measured. Design: In total, 8 obese type- 2 -diabetic women were randomized to receive treatment with 100 mg of <b>miglitol</b> or placebo three times a day for 2 days (six doses total) in a double-blind fashion. On day 3 of each treatment period (<b>miglitol</b> or placebo), measurements of GLP- 1, GIP, insulin and glucose were taken periodically during 3 h after eating a 720 kcal breakfast. Appetite ratings with visual analogue scales (VASs) were used to assess ingestive behaviour hourly just before breakfast and hourly after for 6 h until immediately before lunch. The number of tuna sandwiches eaten at lunch was used to measure food consumption. Results: The plasma GLP- 1, glucose, insulin and GIP levels in response to the mixed meal were compared after the <b>miglitol</b> and placebo treatment. <b>Miglitol</b> effectively enhanced postprandial GLP- 1 release and suppressed plasma GIP secretion. The ingestion of a mixed meal induced a remarkable rise in GLP- 1 after <b>miglitol</b> as compared with placebo in overweight diabetic subjects. The meal-related rise in GLP- 1 after <b>miglitol</b> was significantly greater at all time-points between 30 and 180 min than after the placebo. The postprandial incremental area under the curve for GLP- 1 with <b>miglitol</b> treatment was about twofold that with the placebo. The GLP- 1 level reached a maximum at 120 min after the mixed meal and steadily rose {{throughout the rest of the}} 3 -h study period. In the miglitol-treated condition, the average caloric intake at lunch during a 30 -min eating period was 12 % lower (p < 0. 05) as compared with that after the placebo in six out of the eight subjects who exhibited a GLP- 1 rise after the breakfast meal by greater than 30 % from the placebo-treated condition. Correspondingly, the average rating scores were significantly lower for hunger feelings and markedly greater for sensations of satiety under the <b>miglitol</b> treatment; beginning 2 and 3 h, respectively, before the lunch test. Conclusions: <b>Miglitol</b> induced an enhanced and prolonged GLP- 1 release at high physiological concentrations after ingesting an ordinary meal in glycaemic-controlled diabetics. The excessive postprandial GLP- 1 elevation after <b>miglitol</b> therapy modified feeding behaviour and food intake, and thereby has potential value in regulating appetite and stabilizing body weight in obese type- 2 -diabetic patients.

40|$|Alpha {{glucoside}} inhibitors used {{to treat}} type- 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) {{are likely to be}} safe and effective. These agents are most effective for postprandial hyperglycemia. <b>Miglitol</b> is a type of drug {{used to treat}} type- 2 DM. A simple, selective, linear, precise and accurate reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated for a related substance of <b>miglitol</b> and its identification, and characterization was done by different mass spectrometry techniques. The gradient method at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min was employed on a prevail carbohydrate ES column (250 × 4. 6 mm, 5 μm particle size) at a temperature of 35 °C. Mobile phase A consisted of 10 mM dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate adjusted to pH 8. 0 using concentrated phosphoric acid and mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile. The ultraviolet detection wavelength was 210 nm and 20 μL of the sample were injected. The retention time for <b>miglitol</b> was about 24. 0 min. Forced degradation of the <b>miglitol</b> sample was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Acidic, basic, neutral, and oxidative hydrolysis, thermal stress, and photolytic degradation were used to assess the stability-indicating the power of the method. Substantial degradation was observed during oxidative hydrolysis. No degradation was observed under the other stress conditions. The method was optimized using samples generated by forced degradation and sample solutions spiked with impurities and epimers. Good resolution of the analyte peak from peaks, corresponding to process-related impurities, epimers and degradation products, was achieved and the method was validated as per the ICH guidelines. The method can successfully be applied for routine analysis of <b>miglitol...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{alpha-glucosidase}} inhibitors acarbose and <b>miglitol</b> {{have been}} successfully used to control postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetics. They probably work by slowing carbohydrate digestion and absorption, but their effect on mouth to caecum transit time has not been studied. The effect acarbose (100 mg), <b>miglitol</b> (100 mg), and placebo on mouth to caecum transit time (380 kcal breakfast with 20 g of lactulose) was investigated in 18 normal volunteers using breath hydrogen analysis. Both <b>miglitol</b> and acarbose significantly increased breath hydrogen excretion (F 2, 34 = 6. 31, p = 0. 005) and shortened the mouth to caecum transit time (F 2, 34 = 3. 49, p = 0. 04) after breakfast compared with placebo. There was a significant negative correlation between breath hydrogen excretion and mouth to caecum transit time suggesting that with shorter transit times significantly more carbohydrates were spilled into the colon. These results indicate that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors accelerate mouth to caecum transit time by inducing carbohydrate malabsorption...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus, fasting {{blood glucose}} values are increased due to increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. As <b>miglitol</b> (BAY m- 1099), an absorbable alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, can inhibit glycogenolysis, we investigated whether 200 mg <b>miglitol</b> ingested at bedtime could decrease fasting blood glucose values. METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients participated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The study duration was 6 weeks: 2 weeks run-in, 2 test periods of 1 week with 2 weeks of wash-out in between. During run-in and wash-out periods placebo tablets were used. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin (FIRI), C-peptide (FCP), glucagon (FG), pyruvate and alanine were measured {{at the start of}} the study, at the end of the run-in and wash-out periods, and at the 6 th and 7 th day of each test period. RESULTS: Both during <b>miglitol</b> and placebo no effects on FBG (12. 2 +/- 2. 5 vs. 12. 2 +/- 2. 5 mmol/l), FIRI (80 +/- 34 vs. 82 +/- 35 pmol/l), FCP (1110 +/- 303 vs. 1043 +/- 304 pmol/l), FG (20 +/- 13 vs. 20 +/- 10 pmol/l), pyruvate (101 +/- 28 vs. 112 +/- 30 mumol/l) or alanine (440 +/- 87 vs. 465 +/- 133 mumol/l) were observed.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{has emerged}} as a major healthcare problem in India. Management of postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) level is important to prevent the complications associated with type- 2 diabetes. Considering paucity of studies motivated us to compare the effect of Acarbose, <b>Miglitol</b> and Voglibose on postprandial hyperglycemia and HbA 1 C. It was single blind, randomized, parallel group, comparative, prospective clinical trial on 90 diabetes type 2 patients defined as post prandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels more than 200 mg % and glycosylated haemoglobin more than 7 % at visit 1. Glycosylated hemoglobin (p= 0. 78) and post prandial blood glucose (p= 0. 61) was reduced more by Voglibose than <b>Miglitol</b> and Acarbose. Though this finding is not statistically significant, adverse effect profile was better with Voglibose (6. 66 %) than <b>Miglitol</b> (16. 66 %) and Acarbose(33. 33 %). Present study recommends use of Voglibose looking at its efficacy and safety profile as preferential choice in the management of postprandial hyperglycaemia in treatment of type- 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Concentrations of <b>miglitol</b> on the adsorptive {{capacity}} {{effect of}} resin were investigated. The pseudo {{first and second}} order equations were {{used to describe the}} kinetic process of ion exchange. The results showed that adsorption of <b>miglitol</b> onto resin is fast and can reach approximate equilibrium after 2. 5 h. Langmuir model is suitable to describe the equilibrium adsorption. By linear fit of the pseudo first and second order equation and comparing the R 2 value of correlation coefficient, it finds that the R 2 value of the pseudo second order equation is bigger, and concludes that the ion exchange process is described by the pseudo second order equation...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background and Objectives In {{this study we}} {{examined the effects of}} switching a-glucosidase inhibitors (a-GI) from acarbose or voglibose to <b>miglitol</b> on glucose fluctu-ations and circulating concentrations of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1), a chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, and fatty acid-binding protein 4, in type 2 diabetic patients for 3 months. Methods We enrolled 47 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, with HbA 1 c levels with 7. 26 ± 0. 5 % (mean ± standard deviation), and who were treated with the highest approved dose of acarbose (100 mg/meal) or voglibose (0. 3 mg/meal) in combination with insulin or sulfonylurea. Patients ’ prior a-GIs were switched to a medium dose of <b>miglitol</b> (50 mg/meal), and the new treatments were main-tained for 3 months. Thirty-five patients who completed the 3 -month study and provided serum samples were analyzed. Results The switch to <b>miglitol</b> for 3 months did not affect HbA 1 c, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total-cholesterol or C-reactive protein levels, or result in any adverse events. Glucose fluctuations were significantly improved by the change in treatment (M-value: 10. 54 ± 4. 32 to 8. 36 ± 2. 54), while serum protein concentrations of MCP- 1 (525. 04 ± 288. 06 – 428. 11 ± 163. 78 pg/mL) and sE-selectin (18. 65 ± 9. 77 – 14. 50 ± 6. 26 ng/mL) were suppressed. Conclusion Our results suggest that switching from acarbose or voglibose to <b>miglitol</b> for 3 months suppressed glucose fluctuations and serum protein levels of MCP- 1 and sE-selectin in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients, with fewer adverse effects. Key Points Switching a-glucosidase inhibitors to <b>miglitol</b> reduced glucose fluctuations and circulating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients Reducing glucose fluctuations may reduce the development of CVD in type 2 diabetic patients...|$|E

40|$|Monotherapy of a-glucosidase {{inhibitor}} (a-GI) or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) inhibitor {{does not}} sufficiently minimize glucose {{fluctuations in the}} diabetic state. In the present study, we evaluated the combined effects of various of a-GI inhibitors (acarbose, voglibose or <b>miglitol)</b> and sitagliptin, a DPP 4 inhibitor, on blood glucose fluctuation, insulin and active glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) levels after nutriment loading in mice. <b>Miglitol</b> and sitagliptin elicited a 47 % reduction (P < 0. 05) of the area under the curve of blood glucose levels for up to 2 h after maltose-loading, a 60 % reduction (P < 0. 05) {{in the range of}} blood glucose fluctuation, and a 32 % decrease in plasma insulin compared with the control group. All three of the combinations elicited a 2. 5 – 4. 9 -fold synergistic increase in active GLP- 1 (P < 0. 05 vs control). Thus, combined treatment with the a-GI <b>miglitol,</b> which more strongly inhibits the early phase of postprandial hyperglycemia, and DPP 4 inhibitor yields both complementary and synergistic effects, and might represent a superior anti-hyperglycemic therapy.
