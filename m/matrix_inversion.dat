25|$|Many quantum machine {{learning}} algorithms in this category are based on variations of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations which, under specific conditions, performs a <b>matrix</b> <b>inversion</b> using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in {{the dimensions of the}} matrix. One of these conditions is that a Hamiltonian which entrywise corresponds to the matrix can be simulated efficiently, which is known to be possible if the matrix is sparse or low rank. For reference, any known classical algorithm for <b>matrix</b> <b>inversion</b> requires a number of operations that grows at least quadratically in the dimension of the matrix.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} some {{improvements to}} the matrix-sign-function algorithm for the algebraic Riccati equation. A simple reorganization changes nonsymmetric <b>matrix</b> <b>inversions</b> into symmetric <b>matrix</b> <b>inversions.</b> Scaling accelerates convergence of the basic iteration and yields a new quadratic formula for certain 2 -by- 2 algebraic Riccati equations. Numerical experience suggests the algorithm be supplemented with a refinement strategy similar to iterative refinement for systems of linear equations. Refinement also produces an error estimate. The resulting procedure is numerically stable. It compares favorably with current Schur vector-based algorithms...|$|R

25|$|Small {{errors in}} floating-point {{arithmetic}} can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations {{an enormous number}} of times. A few examples are <b>matrix</b> <b>inversion,</b> eigenvector computation, and differential equation solving. These algorithms must be very carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as Iterative refinement, if they are to work well.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{transformation}} {{is called a}} diagonalizable matrix since in the eigenbasis, the transformation is represented by a diagonal matrix. Because operations like matrix multiplication, <b>matrix</b> <b>inversion,</b> and determinant calculation are simple on diagonal matrices, computations involving matrices are much simpler if we can bring the matrix to a diagonal form. Not all matrices are diagonalizable (even over an algebraically closed field).|$|E
25|$|<b>Matrix</b> <b>inversion</b> {{also plays}} a {{significant}} role in the MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix H. It is crucial for the matrix H to be invertible for the receiver to be able to figure out the transmitted information.|$|E

The objective is not only to solve these equations through a meshless-based method, but also {{to find a way to}} build shape functions that could work for any cross-sectional geometry. We have found that the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximation is not able to provide useful shape functions in every situation. This technique relies on <b>matrix</b> <b>inversions</b> and, according to the geometry, singular matrices can occur.
