40|$|A {{numerical}} model is developed {{for studying the}} transport of colloid facilitated radionuclide transport in a coupled fracture-matrix system. The radionuclides and the colloids are assumed to decay, sorb on the fracture surface, as well as diffuse into the rock matrix. The sorption of the radionuclides onto the mobile and immobile colloids within the fracture {{is assumed to be}} linear. The governing equations describing the radionuclide and colloidal transport along the fracture axis and diffusive mass transport within the rock matrix, which is normal to the fracture axis are coupled together, while maintaining the continuity of fluxes at the fracture-matrix interface. Constant concentration is assumed at the inlet of the fracture for both colloids as well as radionuclides and varying grid is adopted at the fracture and rock-matrix interface to capture the flux transfer. Spatial moments are performed on the concentration profiles of the radionuclides in order to investigate the impact on the mobility and dispersion behavior of the radionuclides. Results suggest that a combination of fluid velocity and colloidal velocity, which influences the residence time of radionuclides within the fracture (against sorption onto the fracture walls, diffusion into the rock-matrix and sorption onto the colloids) ultimately decides the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> The presence of colloids retards the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in the aqueous phase.

The biogeochemical processes that will occur in this environment, {{and the extent to which}} they will impact on radionuclide migration, are currently poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of biogeochemical processes on the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radionuclide</b> technetium, in column experiments designed to be representative of aspects of the alkali-disturbed zone. Results indicate that microbial processes were capable of inhibiting 99 mTc migration through columns, and X-ray radiography demonstrated that extensive physical changes had occurred to the material within columns where microbiological activity had been stimulated. The utilisation of organic acids under highly alkaline conditions, generating H 2 and CO 2, may represent a mechanism by which microbial processes may alter the hydraulic conductivity of a geological environment. Column sediments were dominated by obligately alkaliphilic H 2 -oxidising bacteria, suggesting that the enrichment of these bacteria may have occurred as a result of H 2 generation during organic acid metabolism. The results from these experiments show that microorganisms are able to carry out a number of processes under highly alkaline conditions that could potentially impact on the properties of the host rock surrounding a geological disposal facility for intermediate level radioactive waste...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{fraction of}} radioactivity entering the environment from different nuclear events {{is associated with}} particles. The impact of these events can only be fully assessed where there is some knowledge about the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> particle bound <b>radionuclides</b> entering the environment. The behavior <b>of</b> particulate <b>radionuclides</b> is dependent on several factors, including the physical, chemical and redox state of the environment, {{the characteristics of the}} particles (e. g., the chemical composition, crystallinity and particle size) and on the oxidative state <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> contained in the particles. Six plutonium-containing particles stemming from Runit Island soil (Marshall Islands) were characterized using non-destructive analytical and microanalytical methods. By determining the activity of {sup 239, 240 }Pu and {sup 241 }Am isotopes from their gamma peaks structural information related to Pu matrix was obtained, and the source term was revealed. Composition and elemental distribution in the particles were studied with synchrotron radiation based micro X-ray fluorescence (SR-{mu}-XRF) spectrometry. Scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEMEDX) and secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) were used to examine particle surfaces. Based on the elemental composition the particles were divided into two groups; particles with plain Pu matrix, and particles where the plutonium is included in Si/O-rich matrix being more heterogeneously distributed. All of the particles were identified as fragments of initial weapons material. As containing plutonium with low {sup 240 }Pu/{sup 239 }Pu atomic ratio, {approx} 2 - 6 %, which corresponds to weapons grade plutonium, the source term was identified to be among the safety tests conducted in the history of Runit Island...|$|R
40|$|Salt marsh cores are {{increasingly}} being used to study metal pollution chronologies. Salt marshes in macro-tidal estuaries, however, tend to retain a time-integrated or ‘smoothed’ signal rather than a record of discrete pollutant inputs, due to extensive sediment reworking. More generally, an accurate chronology of metal input to salt marsh sediments {{can be difficult to}} assess because of the potential early-diagenetic <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> both the <b>radionuclides</b> used for dating and the contaminants of interest. A dated salt marsh core from the macro-tidal Medway Estuary, southeast England, was assessed using both total sediment metal data and partitioning data. These data indicate that both Mn and Fe have been significantly remobilised and that these diagenetic processes have slightly modified the vertical distributions of Cu, Pb and Zn. Zinc is the most diagenetically reactive followed by Cu and then Pb. However, general trends in pollutant loading can still be identified with maximum inputs occurring between ca. 1900 and 1950, decreasing towards the present day...|$|R
