40|$|DE 10059160 A UPAB: 20011026 NOVELTY - Bonding {{of plastic}} {{component}} (1) to support, comprising a laser-transparent section, {{at least in}} zones where there is contact (3) between the components on the side away from the surface. Contacts are illuminated by the laser through the support and energy is at least partially absorbed by the plastic component for welding at the contacts. The energy does not damage or alter outer surface. USE - The system is for applications such as bonding the inner lining to a vehicle door, a bumper, a <b>mud</b> <b>guard</b> wing cladding or a luggage space cover. ADVANTAGE - The system gives an effective and durable bond between the plastics lining and the vehicle bodywork, without marking or damaging the outer appearance, and at speeds matching the rate of a high speed vehicle production line...|$|E

5000|$|The {{state of}} Illinois enacted a statute {{requiring}} curved <b>mud</b> <b>guards,</b> instead of straight mudflaps on trucks driven in Illinois.

[...] The Illinois legislature asserted that the unique curved mudguards would be more useful in preventing stones and other debris to be kicked up {{from the back of}} trucks, thus preventing more accidents than other types of mudflaps. The plaintiffs were trucking companies who drove through Illinois and would have to use one form of mudflap equipment while in Illinois, but other mudflap equipment while in other states. The named plaintiff was Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., of New Mexico.|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of messengers use a bag to carry deliveries and personal effects. Bags {{with a single}} strap that wraps diagonally across the chest (popularly known as messenger bag) are popular {{because they can be}} swung around the messenger's body to allow access without removing the bag. Clasps which can be adjusted with one hand (ideal for riding), clips, pockets and webbing loops on the strap for holding a cell phone or two-way radio and other equipment also feature on purpose-built messenger bags. Bags generally have large capacities (up to 50 liters or 3,000 cubic inches). [...] Baskets and racks mounted on the bike are also used, and at least one messenger service (in New York City) equips its riders with specialized three-wheel cycles (sometimes known as cargo-trikes), with a large trunk in the rear. Many bicycle messengers also wear helmets and mount lights and fenders (<b>mud</b> <b>guards)</b> to their bicycles.|$|R

All models had small cup holders under the radio and a small glovebox which were improved in the 1998 redesign.|$|R
