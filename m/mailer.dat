5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman <b>Mailer</b> and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman <b>Mailer</b> in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Newsom placed {{first in}} the November 4, 2003, general {{election}} in a nine-man field. Newsom received 41.9 {{percent of the vote}} to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 {{in the first round of}} balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate <b>mailer</b> in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received the endorsement of Willie Brown.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers at Stanford University and Dartmouth College sent {{election}} <b>mailers</b> {{to voters}} in Montana labelled the [...] "2014 Montana General Election Voter Information Guide." [...] The <b>mailers</b> contain the Montana state seal and rate how liberal or conservative the four nonpartisan candidates {{are in the}} Supreme Court race. Secretary of State Linda McCulloch charged that the <b>mailers</b> were deceitful because they used the state seal without her office's authorization and made it appear as if the <b>mailers</b> were authorized by her office.|$|R

50|$|With today’s {{document}} output technologies, <b>mailers</b> can modify and reengineer print streams, {{moving and}} adding information (such as barcodes) on the fly. Likewise, <b>mailers</b> can print barcodes directly on envelopes using an envelope finishing system. Either way, this approach enables <b>mailers</b> to centralize and standardize barcode creation {{on the production}} floor using the original data files without impacting upstream business applications.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded <b>mailer</b> that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Carole Mallory, {{a former}} mistress, sold seven boxes of {{documents}} and photographs to Harvard University, Norman Mailer's alma mater. They contain extracts of her letters, books and journals. In 2003, the Norman <b>Mailer</b> Society was founded to help insure {{the legacy of}} Mailer's work. In 2008, The Norman <b>Mailer</b> Center and The Norman <b>Mailer</b> Writers Colony, a non-profit organization for educational purposes, was established to honor Norman <b>Mailer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout his lifetime, <b>Mailer</b> wrote over 45,000 letters. In 2014, Mailer's biographer J.

Norman <b>Mailer</b> is buried in Provincetown Cemetery, Provincetown, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|Other feminist {{icons and}} personalities are {{featured}} in the film during the question period, such as Betty Friedan, criticizing <b>Mailer's</b> moderating skills, Susan Sontag, who criticizes <b>Mailer's</b> gendered language, and Anatole Broyard who asks about post-liberation narratives.|$|R
5000|$|In late October, Monte Schulz, {{the son of}} Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, {{objected to}} the use of fonts, colors schemes, and other {{elements}} of his father's cartoons in mailings attacking Brown and said that he believed such <b>mailers</b> infringed on the cartoon's copyrights. (The <b>mailers</b> did not use Peanuts' characters.) Schulz sent copies of the <b>mailers</b> to the two companies who owned the trademarks and had editorial and art control, which sent them on to lawyers for further review. A spokesman for the Doolittle campaign said that the <b>mailers</b> came from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which by law does not coordinate with the Doolittle campaign.|$|R
2500|$|Based on <b>Mailer's</b> {{experience}} as an army cook, [...] "The Language of Men" [...] {{was first published in}} Esquire in April 1953 – the first of over 40 for Esquire – and is <b>Mailer's</b> most autobiographical story.|$|R
25|$|With {{the script}} finished, <b>Mailer</b> {{and the others}} {{set out to find}} the lead actress for the play. In October 1982, <b>Mailer</b> was {{attending}} a Park Avenue dinner party given by Claus von Bülow, who at that time was on trial for the attempted murder of von Bülow's wife, Sunny, and had been out of jail only two days on US$1 million bail. Also attending the party was Australian-based theatre actress Kate Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick was introduce to <b>Mailer</b> and spoke with <b>Mailer</b> during dinner after <b>Mailer</b> swapped the place cards to seat Fitzpatrick beside him. After deciding that Fitzpatrick was perfect to play Marilyn Monroe in Strawhead, <b>Mailer,</b> Hunter, and Hannum met with Fitzpatrick to give her the script. Fitzpatrick turned down the part, since she already was committed to playing Marilyn Monroe in Terry Johnson's 1982 play, Insignificance.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{published}} in Esquire in 1963, <b>Mailer</b> later worked this story into an unpublished screenplay with wife Norris Church <b>Mailer</b> about a Noah's Ark spaceship.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Busch {{asserts that}} <b>Mailer</b> {{has created a}} voice that speaks about Sam, and it might also {{represent}} <b>Mailer</b> in some ways. The problem, states Busch, is <b>Mailer</b> wants to speak about his own difficulties writing, but needs to objectify his voice {{in order to create}} fiction and not autobiography. Thus, he not only analyzes the characters' feelings, but also his own.|$|E
50|$|Eric Roth, the film's screenwriter, {{began to}} work on the project after he {{abandoned}} his attempt to bring Norman <b>Mailer's</b> Harlot's Ghost to the screen. Like De Niro's film, <b>Mailer's</b> novel is a fictionalized chronicle of the CIA.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its bawdy content, [...] "The Time of Her Time" [...] {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted {{as one of}} <b>Mailer's</b> most well-written short stories. George Steiner notes that [...] "all of <b>Mailer's</b> obsessions are concentrated and disciplined in this wry tale." ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} two months, in the lead up to the Congressional midterm elections, {{households}} will be bombarded with campaign publicity including <b>mailers,</b> which will aim to convince them to vote for one candidate over another. But are such <b>mailers</b> an effective campaign tactic? In new research that uses data from the 2012 elections, David Doherty and E. Scott Adler find that if sent out in the months prior to election, {{both positive and negative}} campaign <b>mailers</b> can be effective in increasing candidate recognition, and voter turnout. They also find that <b>mailers</b> sent closer to the election have little effect on voters’ attention and intention, likely because interested voters will have already found out about candidates by this point...|$|R
25|$|In his introduction, <b>Mailer</b> details his {{conflicted}} {{attitude toward}} the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one. This claim, however, might just be a way for <b>Mailer</b> to mitigate any negative criticism and show modesty by denying his abilities, or as a ruse {{to get us to}} discover for ourselves whether <b>Mailer</b> can write a good short story.|$|E
25|$|In November 1985, <b>Mailer</b> {{brought his}} {{play to the}} Actors Studio, an Off Broadway theater and school that gained {{worldwide}} recognition {{under the leadership of}} Lee Strasberg. The scenes presented were workshop scenes and <b>Mailer</b> put himself in position of director of the two-act production. In addition to the cast including Robert Heller, Mickey Knox and Patrick Sullivan, <b>Mailer</b> added his wife Norris Church to the cast. There was no admission charge to the workshop.|$|E

25|$|To {{move the}} script along, <b>Mailer</b> {{presented}} {{the beginnings of}} Strawhead for critique to the Actors Studio Playwright And Directors Unit, an exclusive group to which <b>Mailer</b> belonged. The early draft had a clichéd Monroe giving a blowjob to the Mailer-interviewer character. In response to former Marilyn Monroe roommate and Academy Award winning actress Shelley Winters blasting Mailer's effort, <b>Mailer</b> rewrote the part to be a burly Maileresque feminist who burst into the play from the audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{first letter}} {{was written on}} February 22, 1965. Both letters feature <b>Mailer</b> {{detailing}} his disappointment in his working relationship with Silvers after he fails to submit two of Mailer's novels to the NYRB despite Mailer's numerous favors for him. In the second letter written on April 4, 1965, <b>Mailer</b> gives Silvers an ultimatum: publish the novels or lose him as a client. Despite the discontent, the second letter ends with <b>Mailer</b> referring to Silvers as his devoted friend.|$|E
