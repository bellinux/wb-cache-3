500|$|Though Oh, Streetcar! {{is based}} on A Streetcar Named Desire, {{the title of the}} musical alludes to the {{theatrical}} revue Oh! Calcutta!. Besides Blanche and Stanley, characters from A Streetcar Named Desire who appear in Oh, Streetcar! include Stella (played by Helen Lovejoy), the Young Collector (played by Apu Nahasapeemapetilon), Mitch (played by Lionel Hutz), the Doctor (played by Chief Wiggum), Steve (played by Jasper Beardley, although Apu originally said he was playing Steve), and Pablo (originally played by Otto Mann but taken over by Llewellyn prior to curtain). The musical's closing song, [...] "Kindness of Strangers", is a reference to Blanche's last line in the original play: [...] "I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." [...] However, the song is very cheery in tone, intentionally <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of Blanche's line, which is meant by the playwright Tennessee Williams to be ironic.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the organization, Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology {{with members of the}} Lisa McPherson Trust. She picketed with signs outside of the organization's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida. Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined US$100. On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E. Penick {{dismissed}} other charges in the case, and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics, commenting, [...] "I'm <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> here. I hope someone will let us know when the great invasion is coming." [...] This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal. She maintained that the actions by representatives of Scientology against her were examples of the policy, [...] "Fair Game"; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization.|$|E
500|$|Carrington {{accused the}} media of {{completely}} <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{that the report}} was not stating {{the views of the}} psychiatrist, rather it was the psychiatrist's interpretation of Webster's feelings. She also considered Mark Riley's extended coverage of the case, which she described at one point as [...] "journalistic voyeurism", to be the most profound case of shifting the blame from the assailants to Leigh herself. One of Riley's articles in particular was considered by her to have suggested that Leigh's discussions with her mother about sex and Leigh's looks and physical development had contributed to her murder. Morrow and San Roque also criticised Riley's article, stating it [...] "disturbingly ... married parental blame with the well-documented notion that the rape victim herself is presumably to blame for her attack". Several writers, including Eva Cox and Adele Horin, rejected the concept that Leigh was in any way responsible for her sexual assault and murder. The media coverage of the murder has been considered by multiple sources {{to be part of a}} wider culture of victim blaming.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Britpop!, John Harris {{concluded}} that the initial negative reviews of the time missed the album's universal strengths. [...] "Those who fussed about the music's more artful aspects were <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> The fact that [...] songs contained so many musical echoes seemed to couch the album in an air of homely reassurance." [...] Harris believed that the [...] "ordinary" [...] nature {{of some of the}} album's songs [...] "turned out to be part of its deeply populist appeal". Rob Sheffield, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called the album [...] "a triumph, full of bluster and bravado but also moments of surprising tenderness". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his retrospective review and gave it a two-star honorable mention, indicating a [...] "likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." [...] He cited [...] "She's Electric" [...] and [...] "Roll with It" [...] as highlights and quipped [...] "give them credit for wanting it all—and (yet another Beatles connection!) playing guitars".|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the good things about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that Not One Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1941 {{performances}} in Switzerland, Brecht believed critics had misunderstood the play. While many sympathized with Courage, Brecht's {{goal was to}} show that Mother Courage was wrong for not understanding the circumstances she and her children were in. According to Hans Mayer, Brecht changed the play for the 1949 {{performances in}} East Berlin to make Courage less sympathetic to the audience. However, according to Mayer, these alterations did not significantly change the audience's sympathy for Courage. Katie Baker, author of a [...] about Mother Courage on its 75th anniversary, notes that [...] " [...] were <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of his Verfremdungseffekt, that breaking of the fourth wall {{which was supposed to}} make the masses think, not feel, in order to nudge them in a revolutionary direction."

2500|$|The film's title has {{a double}} meaning. In Vaud, the French-speaking part of Switzerland where Godard was raised and {{currently}} lives, the word [...] "adieu" [...] can mean both goodbye and hello [...] "according {{to the time}} of day, the tone of voice." [...] Godard has acknowledged that this interpretation would only be understood in Vaud and said [...] "nowadays, it seems that talking has nothing to do, that speech no longer exists." [...] He believes that words are losing all meaning and that [...] "we are <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point...</b> when I say 'Farewell' to language, it really means 'Farewell', meaning to say goodbye to my own way of speaking." [...] However Godard believes that images, like films that mix words and visuals, are still capable of meaningful communication, citing Islamic and Christian prohibitions of certain images while allowing words as an example. Godard said that in the sequence with Mary Shelley and himself painting with watercolors he wanted to visually show the physical acts of the language of writing and the language of visual art. Bordwell believes that a theme of the film is [...] "the idea that language alienates us from some primordial connection to things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indiana Jones is {{essentially}} the archetype for the field of archaeology, individuals who are actively involved in this field {{are influenced by the}} ideas put forward in the films and any other associated media. Indiana Jones is still a highly debated topic among archaeologists, whether the influence of these films is positive or negative has yet to be determined. The argument for these films having a negative influence states that it reflects poorly on the field, one prominent individual with this opinion is Anne Pyburn. Pyburn described the influence of Indiana Jones as being one that is elitist and sexist, she {{went on to say that}} the Indiana Jones films have caused new discoveries in the field of archaeology to become oversimplified and overhyped in an attempt to gain public interest which negatively influences archaeology as a whole. Eric Powell, an editor with the magazine Archaeology, was quoted saying [...] "O.K., fine, the movie romanticizes what we do," [...] continuing on to say that [...] "Indy may be a horrible archeologist, but he’s a great diplomat for archeology. I think we'll see a spike in kids who want to become archeologists." [...] In an article written by Kevin McGeoughs, an associate professor of archaeology, he describes the original archaeological criticism of the film as <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the film. Going on to say that the various critiques of poor excavation techniques used were a plot feature to make the film more enjoyable and that in doing so it is not trying to push an agenda. He finished by saying, [...] "dramatic interest is what is at issue, and it is unlikely that film will change in order to promote and foster better archaeological techniques".|$|E

She turned up several years later in Paris and was known to all the Americans and English at the Cafe du Dome as Mrs. Short. She reappeared in London as Mrs. Griffiths, published a small volume of verse, and was accepted in several circles known to us. And now, as I still insist, she has disappeared from society altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is a {{very fine}} art; and has been carried to {{something}} like perfection by politicians and Pressmen to-day. For the point is generally a very sharp point; and is, moreover, sharp at both ends. That {{is to say that}} both parties would probably impale themselves in an uncomfortable manner if they did not manage to avoid it altogether. I have just been looking at the election address of the official Liberal candidate for the part of the country in which I live; and though it is, if anything, rather more logical and free from cant than most other documents of the sort it is an excellent example of <b>missing</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> The candidate has to go boring on about Free Trade and Land Reform and Education; and nobody reading it could possibly imagine that in the town of Wycombe, where the poll will be declared, the capital of the Wycombe division of Bucks which the candidate is contesting, centre of the important and vital trade on which it has thriven, a savage struggle about justice has been raging for months past between the poor and rich, as real as the French Revolution. The man offering himself at Wycombe as representative of the Wycombe division simply says nothing about it at all. It is as if a man at the crisis of the French Terror had offered himself as a deputy for the town of Paris, and had said nothing about the Monarchy, nothing about the Republic, nothing about the massacres, nothing about the war; but had explained with great clearness his views on the suppression of the Jansenists, the literary style of Racine, the suitability of Turenae for the post of commander-in-chief, and the religious reflections of Madame de Maintenon. For, at their best, the candidate's topics are not topical. Home Rule {{is a very}} good thing, and modern education is a very bad thing; but neither of them are things that anybody is talking about in High Wycombe. This is the first and simplest way of missing the point: deliberately to avoid and ignore it.|$|E
