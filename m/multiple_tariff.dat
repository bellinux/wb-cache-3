50|$|On 4 July 1995, The Conference {{formally}} admitted Suriname as {{the fourteenth}} Member of the Caribbean Community, following the deposit of the Instruments of Accession to the Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Common Market Annex. The instrument of Accession to the Common Market made provision for Suriname {{to implement the}} arrangements relating to the Common Market effective 1 January 1996. Suriname's accession to the Community and the Common Market led to significant changes in Suriname's external trade policy as prior to accession, a <b>multiple</b> <b>tariff</b> regime ranging from 0 to 100 percent under the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN) classification system was in force. In preparation for CARICOM membership, this system was replaced in 1994 with the Harmonized System (HS) {{used as the basis}} for determining duty-free entry of goods of CARICOM origin and for applying the common external tariff. Suriname's 1996 entry into the free trade area was immediate with no major transition phase contemplated in the accession agreement apart from some exceptions granted under the Treaty of Chaguaramas and a few others negotiated by Suriname upon entry.|$|E

The ACCC has contracted the Communications Research Unit (CRU) of the Department of Communications Information Technology and the Arts to assist the ACCC meet its price reporting obligations under the Trade Practices Act 1974 for the past three years. The first two studies that the CRU completed for the ACCC reported the movement in prices for telecommunications services in dollar values for each service.

Compared with earlier dynamic models, the apparatus allows for <b>multiple</b> <b>tariffs</b> and unemployment - characteristics present in most less developed countries undertaking trade liberalization. Temporary tariffs on imported consumer and intermediate goods induce intratemporal and intertemporal substitution. Both types of tariffs raise the price of present to future consumption, but have different effects on the consumer price of non-traded relative to traded goods. The path of the real exchange rate, production, and employment in particular depend on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, wage formation, and the initial relative size of different tariffs.

30|$|For many services, {{consumers}} can choose among {{a range of}} optional tariffs that differ in their access and usage prices. Recent studies indicate that tariff-specific preferences may lead consumers to choose a tariff that does not minimize their expected billing rate. This study analyzes how tariff-specific preferences influence the responsiveness of consumers’ usage and tariff choice to changes in price. We show that consumer heterogeneity in tariff-specific preferences leads to heterogeneity in their sensitivity to price changes. Specifically, consumers with tariff-specific preferences are less sensitive to price increases of their preferred tariff than other consumers. Our results provide an additional reason why firms should offer <b>multiple</b> <b>tariffs</b> rather than a uniform nonlinear pricing plan to extract maximum consumer surplus.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{relatively}} small menu of three-part tariffs (3 PTs) can be more profitable and, sometimes, socially more desirable than a larger menu (more items) of two-part tariffs (2 PTs). Often, a single three-part tariff can beat a sorting menu comprising <b>multiple</b> two-part <b>tariffs.</b> Moreover, this 3 PT menu can be designed with less information about consumer preferences, relative to the menu of two-part tariffs which, in order to segment customers optimally, needs fine-grained information about preferences. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that more ornamental tariffs need not always be more profitable, the source of ornateness influences how efficiently the tariff can price discriminate.

40|$|Two firms sell a {{homogeneous}} product to two buyers who differ significantly in their valuation {{of the good}} and are allowed to charge (possibly) <b>multiple</b> two-part <b>tariffs.</b> Firms decide upon optimal prices and the choice of sales technologies which help acquire revenues from nonlinear prices. There is a subgame-perfect equilibrium where firms choose different sales technologies and the firm with an advanced sales technology emerges to be a price leader, charging a two-part tariff and selling only to the low-valuation buyers. Consequently, the firm with the less advanced sales technology follows, charges only a fixed fee and serves the high-valuation buyers and always earns strictly higher profits than its leader.

40|$|Current {{electricity}} tariffs do {{not reflect}} the real costs that a customer incurs to a supplier, as units are charged at the same rate, regardless of the consumption pattern. In this paper, we propose a prediction-ofuse (POU) tariff that better reflects the predictability cost of a customer. Our tariff asks customers to pre-commit to a baseline consumption, and charges them based on both their actual consumption and the deviation from the anticipated baseline. First, we study, from a cooperative game theory perspective, the cost game induced by a single such tariff, and show customers would have an incentive to minimize their risk, by joining together when buying electricity as a grand coalition. Second, we study the efficient (i. e. costminimizing) structure of buying groups for the more realistic setting when <b>multiple,</b> competing POU <b>tariffs</b> are available. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to compute the efficient buyer groups, and validate our approach experimentally, using a large-scale data set of domestic consumers in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Current {{electricity}} tariffs do {{not reflect}} the real cost that customers incur to suppliers, as units are charged at the same rate, regardless of how predictable each customers consumption is. A recent proposal to address this problem are prediction-of-use tariffs. In such tariffs, a customer is asked in advance to predict her future consumption, and is charged based both on her actual consumption and the deviation from her prediction. Prior work (Vinyals et al. 2014) studied the cost game induced by a single such tariff, and showed customers would have an incentive to minimize their risk, by joining together when buying electricity as a grand coalition.

The Swedish tariff gave smaller estimates and so may result in less cost-effective interventions than the UK tariff.

40|$|Driven by {{climate change}} and fast {{depleting}} stock of fossil fuel, electrification of transport systems, both rail and road, has been promoted by many governments around the world. The resultant changes in the load demand in the transmission and distribution electricity networks, along with other motivations such as integrating distributed generation from renewable sources, improving energy efficiency through demand response (DR) and managing increasingly aged infrastructure, {{have led to the}} paradigm of Smart Grid being proposed as the next generation of the power grid. Electric vehicle (EV) as a load type requiring power for rechargi~g has a significant I impact on power systems, e. g. increases of peak demand, voltage drop, powerlosses and harmonic distortion, decrease of load factor, transformer overload and feeder congestion. The work presented in this thesis studies the aspect ofDR in Smart Grid which could help mitigate the impact of EV s on power demand and exploit the ability to manage EV s charging times for improving power system performance, i. e. flattening the system load profile. It aims to address the following issues: modelling and monitoring EV charging profiles to obtain load information; and developing a DR model for optimising power systems demand due to EV charging. Through comprehensive research, a model of the EV charging load is obtained by statistical analysis. A non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system, capable of monitoring and identifying the presence of traditional appliance and the EV charging loads through measurements at a single point in a household, i. e. the consumer unit has been developed. In the light of the outcomes of the load research, two novel DR programs based on <b>multiple</b> time-of-use (TOU) <b>tariffs</b> and real-time prices with penalties (RTPP) respectively are proposed to manage EV charging for the optimisation of power systems demand. Example studies are carried out to validate and evaluate the DR programs. Results show that the programs can help flatten the system load profile and the fluctuations in the profile decrease gradually with increasing penetration levels of EV s. Furthermore, by levelling off load requirements, the programs could allow generation companies to operate their plant more efficiently, reduce degradation of power plant due to inefficient operation, help to reduce utility costs, and hence reduce customer bills. I. The developed load model, NILM system and DR model in this thesis provide much improved tools in EV charging load prediction and management for power system planning and optimal operations, because the stochastic behaviour of the EV charging load and diversities among EV s that have not been considered in previous researches are carefully studied. The proposed DR programs give a valuable insight into strategies for the design and implementation of DR in the future Smart Grid, resulting in possible congestion due to concurrent responses be avoided.
