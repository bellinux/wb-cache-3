5|$|The {{impact of}} Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> {{seen in the}} {{establishment}} of September 11 as Panamerican Teacher's Day which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, held in Panama. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America's teacher. In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, opened immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.|$|E
5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the clerk of works and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> the tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral {{is very much in}} the European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside the body of the cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E
5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} form of {{political}} organisation in the early Middle Ages, with competing minor kingdoms and fluid relationships of over- and under-kingdoms. The primary function of these kings was as war leaders, {{but there were also}} ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation. The Kingdom of Alba, which emerged from the unification of the Scots and Picts in the tenth century, retained some of these ritual aspects, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> in the coronation ceremony at Scone. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of western European courts and later elements of their ritual and grandeur.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} {{variations on the}} culmination of the story after the breaking of Aoife's curse, and <b>most</b> are <b>obviously</b> influenced by stories from Christianity. For more on the story, see the article on the Children of Lir.|$|R

25|$|The four {{panels are}} <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> {{connected}} by the floor tiling and vanishing point. Shadows {{falling on the}} tiling at the lower right hand corner of each panel can only have been cast by the moulding on the frames, that is from an area outside of the pictorial space.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Cyberpunk, though, has been long-lasting. Elements {{of both the}} setting and {{storytelling}} have become normal in science fiction in general, {{and a slew of}} sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> Steampunk, but also a host of other Cyberpunk derivatives.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{the upper}} {{parts of the}} walls were rebuilt with larger dormer windows. Other windows were also enlarged, and the stair wing was rebuilt. <b>Most</b> <b>obviously,</b> a new {{entrance}} and stair {{was added to the}} south, and a new wing to the north.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>obviously,</b> legalese {{suffers from}} being less comprehensible {{to the general}} public than plain English, which can be {{particularly}} important in both private (e.g., contracts) and public matters (e.g., laws, especially in democracies where the populace is seen as both responsible for and subject to the laws).|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} Jacobite support came from those {{dissatisfied}} with political developments. Some Whigs, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> the Earl of Mar, reacted to political disappointments by joining the Jacobites, but {{while others were}} courted from 1692 onwards and indicated support, mostly this was just reinsurance in case the Jacobites came out on top.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} based on the four-{{cylinder}} Honda CB500, but with two extra cylinders. The cylinder head fins of the Sei were squared off to provide a cosmetic individuality, but otherwise the engine is in <b>most</b> respects <b>obviously</b> derived from the Honda. The [...] "angular, bold design" [...] was by Carrozzeria Ghia. It produced [...] at 9,000 rpm, had a top speed of around 127 mph {{and was one of the}} smoothest European tourers.|$|R
40|$|Contact allergy to herbal teas {{derived from}} the Asteraceac plant family was {{investigated}} in patients allergic to sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). 20 patients with a known contact allergy to SLs were recalled and patch tested with aqueous extracts of 8 different herbal teas based on Asteraceae plants {{as well as with}} parthenolide and other SLs. In 18 of 20 patients with SL allergy, there were positive test reactions to the Asteraceae teas, mainly to those based on German chamomile, dandelion and wormwood. Among the SLs, parthenolide was the <b>most</b> frequent co-reactor. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>most</b> patients with a contact allergy to SLs are allergic to commercial teas {{derived from the}} Asteraceae plant family as well...|$|R

25|$|Violence among humans {{occurs in}} {{distinct}} patterns, differing <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> by sex. Ethnographic findings and modern crime {{data indicate that}} the majority of violence is both perpetrated by and targeted at males, and males are the most likely to be victims of violence. This male-male pattern of violence has been observed so repeatedly and in so many cultures that it may qualify as a human universal.|$|E
25|$|The frescoes' {{effect on}} Renaissance artists was instant and {{profound}} (it {{can be seen}} <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> in Raphael's decoration for the loggias in the Vatican), and the white walls, delicate swags, and bands of friezeframed reserves containing figures or landscapeshave returned at intervals ever since, notably in late 18th century Neoclassicism, making Famulus {{one of the most}} influential painters in the history of art.|$|E

Males guarding nests were distinctly colored, i. e., dark {{with little or no}} mottling, and <b>most</b> were <b>obviously</b> scarred. Two types of guarding behaviors were observed: 1) Males lying directly on or beside the nest and remaining nearly motionless unless touched and 2) males lying on a sentry post and defending the nest when other fish swam close...|$|R
25|$|In {{thrombotic}} thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or {{has been}} inhibited by antibodies directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.|$|E
25|$|The meticulous naturalism of {{his youth}} gave way to an {{increasing}} abstraction of form. Except for his characteristically brilliant draftsmanship and obsession with the figure, the pictures created in this late period of his life bear little superficial resemblance to his early paintings. Ironically, it is these paintings, created late in his life, and after {{the heyday of the}} Impressionist movement, that <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> use the coloristic techniques of Impressionism.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} and formalized shapes and {{spaces of the}} modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>obviously,</b> architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of buildingoften maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and artbut which had been abandoned by the modern movement.|$|E

25|$|For Andrew Schapper, Wild Seed is {{an entry}} {{point to the}} âethics of {{controlled}} evolutionâ that permeate Butlerâs novels, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> in the Xenogenesis trilogy. As an early novel on the subject, Wild Seed betrays Butlerâs anxiety that eugenic manipulation and selective breeding could lead to an unethical abuse of power and thus she counters it with a âJudeo-Christian ethical approach to the sanctity of human lifeâ represented by the character of Anyanwu.|$|E
25|$|Departures {{from the}} {{expected}} pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations {{or because of}} geographic barriers. In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers, and <b>most</b> <b>obviously,</b> the Grand Canyon, can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups. Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloans, and their greater differences from the Hohokam and Patayan, is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.|$|E
25|$|The Metro has a {{distinctive}} design and corporate identity, to distinguish {{itself from the}} decrepit rail system it replaced and to match the livery of the buses then in use. The Calvert typeface, used for signage and in printed materials, was designed specifically for the Metro by Margaret Calvert. The corporate identity was revised in 1998, de-emphasising the Calvert font, and adding the word Metro to its M logo. A further revision made in 2008, and subsequently rolled out, re-emphasises the Calvert font, <b>most</b> <b>obviously</b> in posters and in signage at the refurbished Haymarket station in the centre of Newcastle.|$|E
50|$|As for fletchings, tail {{feathers}} of crane are favored, but tail {{feathers of}} all birds are usable. Eagle feathers make a particularly exclusive arrow, but since eagles are rare <b>most</b> arrows <b>obviously</b> cannot have fletchings from eagle's tail feathers. Feathers {{taken from the}} wings are said to flow less smoothly through the air, so if given the choice tail feathers are picked. The Mongols characteristically {{pay close attention to}} minutest of detail; the placement of the fletchings in relation to their size, and what part of the bird they were taken from, is of great importance for correct rotation and good balance in the air. Consequently, these factors are painstakingly considered when making arrows after the Old Mongol standard.|$|R
