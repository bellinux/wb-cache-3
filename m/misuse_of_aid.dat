The Commission’s decisions in Polish cases have already provided important clarifications (e. g. regarding the application of alternative State aid exemptions to pre-accession restructuring cases in Technologie Buczek) and raised significant new legal issues (e. g. the application of the EC State aid rules to pre-accession aid under Protocol No. 8 of the Accession Treaty in Huta Częstochowa or an agent’s actions triggering pre-accession cartel liability in BR/ESBR).

Later, he participated in a construction of primary schools and housing and helped to oversee this aid construction project. Through the building project he then faced many challenges and learned the complexity of a disaster; including economy, politic, security, and <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> injustices, and corruption; at the same time still carrying a thought of seeking the identity of design in such condition and how it could function to better situation. Engaging all levels of communities; includes the government, the aid sector, the displaced, and the merchants, he produces a documentation, a video, and a manual of how design and designer can engage with the topic of disaster through live interaction and how common aid, support, and help should be given to function more effectively in case of disaster or other humanitarian purposes...|$|E

40|$|ESEA was {{to ensure}} {{educational}} opportunities {{to the children}} of the poor and to equalize them. The aid was given not to 'schools' but 'children', according to the 'child-benefit' theory. The theory pigeonholed the issues on religion (church-state relationship) and federal control. The another aim of ESEA was to avoid state and local financial difficulties and to secure the equality of their financial ability to prepare equal opportunities. But the needs of aimed children and state and local difficulties were neglected in the congressional debates. And ESEA was and is judged to be failed because <b>of</b> the <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> by local agencies. The most important points to be discussed were how to realize the aim of ESEA and how to help state and local governments to do so. The basis of decentralized system of education is autonomous reform and activities carried out locally. Based upon them, federal aid is to be an essential and active part of state and local finance. We must also study following points : Why grants in aid? Is there another form <b>of</b> <b>aids?</b> Is federal aid essential to state and local government finance? and so on...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{importance}} of the local elite as a determinant of the effectiveness <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> in developing countries. The local elite serves as an intermediary between aid donors and aid recipients through its control of the government and major firms. The likelihood <b>of</b> <b>misusing</b> <b>aid</b> is large if the elite is characterized by extensive economic and political power and little concern for social groups besides itself. To determine which countries have this type of elite we use a historically determined variable: the percentage of European settlers in total population in colonial times. We provide strong empirical evidence that the level of European settlement in colonial times is negatively related to the effectiveness <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> as measured in a growth-regression framework.

Christie and his family appeared in television commercials produced for the campaign, paid for by HUD, which were broadcast in the run-up to the 2013 gubernatorial election. Pallone called for investigation to dispel any appearance of impropriety, also drawing attention $2.2 million difference for fees between the accepted bid and the next most expensive which included no plans to include the governor in the ads. On January 14, 2014, HUD announced that it would review the expenditure. A press release stated that it is [...] "an audit and not an investigation of the procurement process." [...] The audit is based on irregularities with billing and adherence to the contract pricing as determined by the federal government. MWW, which produced the campaign, stated that it welcome the review and that it had not presented the idea of Christie appearing in ads until after contract was awarded and that it was confident that it had followed correct billing procedures. The Asbury Park Press reported that a MWW executive had earlier said the Christie's appearance was part of the initial pitch and that information received from an open records law request was greatly redacted.|$|R
40|$|Depending on the {{regulatory}} regime they are subject to, governments {{may or may}} not be allowed to hand out state aid to private firms. The economic justification for state aid can address several issues present in the competition for capital and the competition for transfers from the state. First, there are principal-agent problems involved at several stages. Self-interested politicians might enter state aid deals that are the result of extensive rent-seeking activities of organized interest groups. Thus the institutional design of political systems will have an effect on the propensity of a jurisdiction to award state aid. Secondly, fierce competition for firm locations can lead to over-spending. This effect is stronger if the politicians do not take into account the entirety of the costs created by their participation in the firm location race. Thirdly, state aid deals can be incomplete and not in the interest of the citizens. This applies if there are no sanctions if firms do not meet their obligations from receiving aid, such as creating a certain number of jobs or not relocating again for a certain amount of time. The separation of ownership and control in modern corporations leads to principal-agent problems on the side <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> recipient as well. Managers might receive personal benefits from subsidies, the use of which is sometimes less monitored than private finance. This can eventually be to the detriment of the shareholders. Overall, it can be concluded that state aid control should also serve the purpose of regulating the contracting between governments and firms. An extended mandate for supervision by the European Commission could include requirements to disincentive the <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid.</b> The Commission should also focus on the corporate governance regime in place in the jurisdiction that awards the aid as well as in the recipient firm...|$|R
