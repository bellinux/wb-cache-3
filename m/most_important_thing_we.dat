In particular, Neumann writes, the artist made himself known for imposing discipline, and for familiarizing young artists with mixed media techniques. Ștefan Câlția credits Podlipny and Corneliu Baba with having instilled in him a [...] "respect for school" [...] that replaced his initial [...] "rather nonconformist" [...] {{approach to}} art training. He also recalled Podlipny telling his students that [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> have been given is the total freedom of expression." [...] Constantin Flondor, who was Podlipny's student between 1950 and 1954, remembers being influenced by his [...] "simple, clear and unshakable" [...] pronouncements on artistic matters, such as: [...] "Art requires an abandonment, a self-sacrifice. Taking your place {{in front of a}} sheet or a canvass which promises the meeting between a piece of vine charcoal or a brush and the white surface is a moment charged with the thrills of genesis. Nothing and no one has the right to disturb one who is in the sacred moment of labor."

A person over the age of 65 is two to three times more likely than a younger adult to get pneumonia. In an older adult, pneumonia and influenza (the "flu") can be life threatening. Older adults with the flu are more likely to get pneumonia or other serious infections. These illnesses can be much more severe and difficult to treat for those over age 60.

Routing protocols of RFID-based internet of things {{are similar to those of}} WSN for they are both multi-hop routing protocols, but due to the differences between their main tasks, working environments and contexts, they also have a lot of differences. At present there are non researches on this aspect.
