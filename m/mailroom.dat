5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the <b>mailroom</b> at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses to raise it with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull Goldin) and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other family problems overwhelm her. She moves to Florence, Italy, where she studies Art History.|$|E

5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Differences between MSC {{and local}} <b>mailrooms</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} that drives investment in an MSC {{is the idea}} that it will be cheaper to operate over time than multiple local <b>mailrooms</b> (mostly by employing fewer workers), thus paying for itself and then saving the institution money over time. Another advantage of an MSC is that it may make terrorist threat mitigation easier by forcing all incoming packages to come through one point of entry, where systems are in place to screen and quarantine any suspicious packages. This is cheaper and more reliable than trying to mitigate at more than one point of entry. Another advantage of an MSC is that such a system is more intuitive to the many users it serves, most of whom (understandably) would not know how their particular institution's system of many <b>mailrooms</b> worked (where all the different <b>mailrooms</b> were, what their hours of operation were, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The various {{technologies}} at {{the heart}} of digital <b>mailrooms</b> help companies rationalise their processes, e.g. it allows companies to reduce costs associated with resending documents between sites.|$|R
25|$|His {{colleagues in}} the <b>mailroom</b> {{included}} Elliot Roberts, who later became Geffen's partner in a management company. Geffen left William Morris to become a personal manager and was immediately successful with Laura Nyro and Crosby, Stills and Nash. When Geffen was engaged {{in the process of}} looking for a record deal for young Jackson Browne, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegün suggested that Geffen start his own record label.|$|E
25|$|At age 17, Pelton {{began in}} the Toronto <b>mailroom</b> of the ad agency BBDO before being {{promoted}} to copywriter. He then worked for various multimedia companies that did product launches, which led to him working for Apple Inc. where {{he worked on the}} Macintosh launch. Pelton then began traveling and reporting from various war zones. His first break as a writer came in 1991, when he reported on the Camel Trophy, an annual competition by Land Rover across difficult terrain in Africa. Pelton competed for the U.S. team and published his account in Soldier of Fortune.|$|E
25|$|The Chamberlain Student Center is {{the main}} {{location}} for dining on campus. Dining options include the Owl's Nest restaurant, Jazzman's Café, the Marketplace buffet, Prof's Place lounge, the Food Court and the RoGo convenience store. The Student Center also features a Game Room where students can play video games on consoles or play arcade games such as ski-ball, ping pong, and air hockey. It is also the home to the Student Government Association, Conference and Event Services, the Greek Affairs Office, Student Activities, the <b>Mailroom</b> and the Information Desk, where students and staff can get their RowanCard ID.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} {{operates in}} 20 countries. Toll People provides personnel services Australia wide through {{a network of}} 17 offices. Toll Priority has over 300 depots and agencies, 550 DX exchanges and 50 <b>mailrooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{major benefit}} of turning all {{incoming}} paper mail into images {{as soon as}} it is received, {{is the extent to which}} it shortens the decision cycle. Although it might be difficult to quantify exactly what the cost savings are, it seems an obvious advantage. Digital <b>mailrooms</b> allow users to receive immediate notification of a document's arrival at the company. Employees can access images in record time, regardless of where the documents were physically acquired. Files can then be processed very rapidly according to their level of urgency. Just as digital <b>mailrooms</b> facilitate the exchange of company information, they also facilitate the coordination of several people around the same document. The decision-making process becomes quicker and more accurate.|$|R
50|$|Fraudsters {{may seek}} access to {{facilities}} such as <b>mailrooms,</b> post offices, offices {{of a tax}} authority, a corporate payroll or a social or veterans' benefit office, which process cheques in large numbers. The fraudsters then may open bank accounts under assumed names and deposit the cheques, which they may first alter in order to appear legitimate, {{so that they can}} subsequently withdraw unauthorised funds.|$|R
25|$|The Box Office (P in the OSF campus diagram above) is on {{the same}} {{courtyard}} as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (G) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the Group Sales Office (H), artistic, business, communication, education, human resources, development, community productions, and the <b>mailroom.</b> The Festival Welcome Center (I), on the northern {{side of the building}} facing Main Street, offers information about OSF and Ashland, houses a small rotating exhibit of costumes from past shows, and adjoins the Margery Bailey Room, otherwise known as the Education Center.

50|$|The Titanics five postal clerks—two British, three American—were {{charged with}} the {{supervision}} and processing of all incoming and outgoing mail on board the ship. On {{the night of the}} disaster, the five postal clerks were celebrating Oscar Woody’s 44th birthday. After the ship hit the iceberg, Jago Smith was sent to report to Captain Smith on the <b>mailrooms</b> conditions, confirming the knowledge that the ship was sinking. The five clerks set themselves to the task of attempting to save the 200 registered mail sacks by hauling them to the upper decks, with little thought of their own safety. All five mail clerks died; only Starr and Woods bodies were recovered.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{traditional}} package {{tracking systems}} {{do not track}} packages after a package is dropped off at a centralized mail services center with single-point delivery, {{such as the ones}} used at apartment complexes, college residence halls, corporate <b>mailrooms,</b> post-office box stores and mail and parcel centers. These mail services centers receive all incoming mail and sort it; the mail may then be delivered to individual recipients or the recipients may have to pick up the mail themselves. To cover that gap and track a package at different points within the internal delivery process, specialized internal or [...] "inbound" [...] package tracking systems have been developed.|$|R
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads.

He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|R

The <b>mailroom</b> opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon; one was covered in feces. A sexually-threatening letter {{was sent to the}} NGC communications officer, who had been quoted in articles about the work.

Although [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes" [...] is an original composition, Yankovic admitted that the intro {{was inspired by the}} style of The Kinks. Lyrically, the song is a plea by the singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand.

500|$|One {{film critic}} {{described}} the numerous influences: [...] "From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero {{trapped in a}} Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not {{in a world that}} seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic monstrousness of the <b>mailroom</b> contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927)." [...] An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: [...] "Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them – and we're not." [...] The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.|$|E

500|$|In the <b>mailroom,</b> Norville is {{assigned}} to deliver a [...] "Blue Letter" [...] to Mussburger; the letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on {{which turns out to}} be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, [...] "you know, for kids." [...] Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus, {{is assigned}} to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows [...] "just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe a word of it.|$|E
500|$|On New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville {{drunk at}} a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz, whom Mussburger had {{convinced}} that Norville had stolen the hula hoop idea after giving him his elevator job back. Norville escapes {{to the top}} floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his <b>mailroom</b> uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. All of a sudden, Moses stops the clock and time freezes. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him the Blue Letter that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger contains a legal document indicating that Hudsucker's shares would go to his immediate successor, who is now Norville.

500|$|Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) {{meet with}} Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish {{owner of a}} large {{department}} store. Roger, feeling uncomfortable due to the novelty of having a Jewish client, enlists the only Jewish person in the company, {{a young man who}} works in the <b>mailroom,</b> to attend the meeting, disguised {{as a member of the}} art department, in order to make Rachel feel comfortable. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in such a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men will not respect her bold plans for the family business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete suggests the [...] "death wish" [...] idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject his idea. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline—"It's toasted!"—along with a strategy that ignores the question of health risks while extolling the virtues of the supposedly unique way that Lucky Strikes are prepared. The client is impressed, but Don is furious at Pete for literally fishing through Don's trash can to uncover and revive something Don had explicitly rejected.|$|E

As he later reported in an interview, he claimed in his job application at WMA that he had graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).

[...] A similar [...] "Arrow lock" [...] is usually located on the centralized mailbox, to allow the entire unit to be opened for efficient filling of individual mailboxes.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those who}} had {{aspirations}} of becoming broadcasters, WMAQ {{was a good place}} to get started in the medium, even if the job was not on the air. [...] The station encouraged its young employees with dreams of working at a microphone by assisting with tuition for college broadcasting courses and holding workshops at the station where those with stars in their eyes were given the chance to display their skills in a [...] "real world" [...] setting. [...] Herb Kent, a Chicago radio pioneer, [...] first came to work in the <b>mailroom</b> at WMAQ as a young high school graduate in the late 1940s.

In 2004, the Moore Building underwent an overhaul makeover to match the appearance of the rest of the University Center with a more efficient floor plan to allow for more room for growth. The new facility caters to the student athlete's needs by housing a dining hall, a 15,000 square foot training and rehab facility, and a more than 8,000 square foot tutorial and study hall space. A multi-purpose theater for team meetings, press conferences, and symposiums is also located on the first floor of the Moore Athletic Center. The main level showcases Florida State's talented student-athletes with wall-to-wall vibrant memories of historic Seminole seasons and athletic achievements, including the 1993 and 1999 football national championships. In an effort to enhance the studies of Florida State students, there is also a designated space for athletic-training curriculum and a studio provided for the College of Communication students to gain hands on experience producing work for Seminole athletics.|$|E
