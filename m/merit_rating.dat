40|$|In sensory and {{marketing}} research both ratings and rankings are frequently {{used to measure}} values or preferences. There is no consensus as to the preferred method. Moreover, cross-national studies concerning this topic are scarce, preventing insight into the comparability of measurement procedures across countries. In this paper, we study rating and ranking of values by the same respondents in five countries in the European Union. Insight is given into the relative <b>merits</b> of <b>rating</b> and ranking measurement by using three-way correspondence analysis. Our findings show that rating and ranking are assessed quite similarly by people from different countries. The minor differences that exist {{may be explained by}} cultural differences in response patterns in ratings. Finally, we recommend a combined rating-ranking approach to determine the preference order for all values in a set, including those considered to be of moderate importance. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Throughout the United States it {{is common}} {{practice}} for automobile insurance premiums for a particular policy to vary depending upon the driver class and geographic location of the policyholder {{as well as the}} type and number of vehicles covered by the policy. In addition, most states also permit so-called "merit rating" plans whereby each policyholder's annual premium is adjusted up or down depending upon the insured's claims experience and traffice violation record during previous years. Although these <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans may be viewed as a special type of risk classification, the rationale underlying their use {{is quite different from the}} justification for driver class and territory differentials. This paper develops a methodology for evaluating <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans that are used in conjunction with other risk classification criteria.

40|$|The docament {{offers two}} {{definitions}} of accountability, a narrow {{one in which}} the teacher's salary must be based eatirely upon a measurement of his teaching competence, and a broader one in which salary is related only partly to a measurement of competence. The major points for and against merit ratings are summarized, followed by a description of the requirements for a successful plan, inclading the prerequisite conditions of acceptance, mutual confidence, participation, and research; a validated and continuous evaluation system; and a basic scale of salaries which adequately reflects the importance of teaching. The wider acceptance of <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans in the United States than in Canada is considered, as well as the probable cost of such a program, which has been estimated at an additional 18 percent of payroll. The philosophical prot'em raised by <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> is due to the conflicting views of the school system as a bureaucracy or as a profession.

40|$|Summary. Oxygen {{consumption}} and ammonia excretion were measured simultaneously in 25 individual shrimps (C. crangon) every two days during a 30 -day imposed starvation. The first response to starvation was a 10 % decrease in 02 {{consumption and}} a 25 % decrease in ammonia excretion. Following this, 02 consumption decreased sharply while ammonia excretion tended to rise. From the 14 th day {{until the end}} of the experi-" <b>merit,</b> the <b>rates</b> of each remained steady, the respiratory rate being about 60 % below and rate of excretion about 30 % above control values. From the O: N ratio it appeared that carbohydrate reserves were quickly exhausted (3 - 4 days) and that lipids and proteins were the main substrates oxidized to meet the energetic requirements of C. crangon. After 2 weeks of starvation the O:N ratio remained constant near a value of 8, indicating that only proteins were being utilised; a 50 % loss of body protein after 30 days suggested that structural proteins were heavily catabolized. The metabolic response of Crangon to starvation (although seasonal variations must be considered) appears to depend mainly on high nitrogen requirements...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityExperience {{rating is}} not an idea that was {{conceived}} in this country. Great Britain and Germany both experimented with the idea before this country even had an unemployment insurance law. The plan was soon found to be unsuccessful by both countries, and it was dropped from the law {{in order to protect}} the benefit fund and to prevent some industries from paying outrageously high tax rates. The United States incorporated experience rating in its unemployment insurance law and by 1948 every state had some type of <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> provision. There are five distinct experience ratings in use in this country - the payroll decline, compensable-separations, reserve-ration, benefit-ration, and benefit-wage ration plans. All the plans have certain things in common in spite of essential differences. They are all devised to establish the relative experience of individual employers with unemployment or benefit costs. [TRUNCATED] Employers must remember that the structure of industry in Massachusetts does not permit the fund to be adequately financed by experience rating. Unemployment will be higher here than in other sections of the country. An attempt to cut into workers' benefits is no solution, for it does not attack the cause of the dilemma. Unless the economy of this state can be re-vitalized, experience rating must be abolished so that the fund will be adequate to meet the claims of the unemployed...|$|E
