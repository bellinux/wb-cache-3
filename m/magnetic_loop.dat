To minimize magnetic losses, and to economize on steel consumption, the assembly was curved into an oval shape that formed a closed <b>magnetic</b> <b>loop</b> [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high, {{in the shape of}} a racetrack; hence the name. The two Alpha I buildings, 9201-1 and 9201-2, each contained two racetracks, with only one in the Alpha I, 9201-3. The Beta racetracks were smaller, linear in shape, and optimized for recovery rather than production, with only 36 instead of 96 process bins. The four Alpha II racetracks were also linear in configuration. They incorporated many improvements, the most important being that they had four sources instead of just two. They also had improved magnets and vacuum systems.|$|E

40|$|We {{obtained}} self-similar solutions of relativistically expanding <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> {{taking into}} account the azimuthal magnetic fields. We neglect stellar rotation and assume axisymmetry and a purely radial flow. As the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> expand, the initial dipole magnetic field is stretched into the radial direction. When the expansion speed approaches the light speed, the displacement current reduces the toroidal current and modifies the distribution of the plasma lifted up from the central star. Since these self-similar solutions describe the free expansion of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops,</b> i. e., $Dv/Dt= 0 $, the equations of motion {{are similar to those of}} the static relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. This allows us to estimate the total energy stored in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> by applying the virial theorem. This energy is comparable to that of the giant flares observed in magnetars.

30|$|Three-dimensional {{instability}} of spontaneous fast magnetic reconnection is studied using MHD (magnetohydro- dynamic) simulation. Previous two-dimensional MHD {{studies have demonstrated}} that, if a current-driven anomalous resistivity is assumed, two-dimensional fast magnetic reconnection occurs and two-dimensional largescale <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops,</b> i.e., plasmoids, are ejected from the reconnection region. In most two-dimensional MHD studies, {{the structure of the}} current sheet is initially one-dimensinal. On the other hand, in recent space plasma observations, fully three-dimensional <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> frequently appear even in the almost one-dimensional current sheet. This suggests that the classical two-dimensional fast magnetic reconnection may be unstable to any three-dimensional perturbation, resulting in three-dimensional fast magnetic reconnection. In this paper, we show that a three-dimensional resistive perturbation destabilizes two-dimensional fast magnetic reconnection and results in three-dimensional fast magnetic reconnection. The resulting three-dimensional fast reconnection repeatedly ejects three-dimensional <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> downstream. The obtained numerical results are similar to the pulsating downflows observed in solar flares. According to the Fourier analysis of the ejected <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops,</b> the time evolution of this three-dimensional instability is fully non-linear.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of {{dynamics of the}} small scale magnetic field on the Sun photosphere is necessary to understand the physical processes occurring in the higher layers of solar atmosphere due to the magnetic coupling between the photosphere and the corona.

The simulation is based on N-body model approach and is divided in two computational layers. We simplify the convection problem, interpreting the larger convective scale, mesogranulation, {{as the result of}} the collective interaction of convective downflow of granular scale. The N-body advection model is the base to generate a synthetic time series of nanoflares produced by interacting <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops.</b> The reconnection of magnetic field lines is the result of the advection of the magnetic footpoints following the velocity field generated by the interacting downflows.

40|$|The Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project {{observed}} {{hundreds of}} young, low-mass stars undergoing highly energetic X-ray flare events. The 32 most powerful {{cases have been}} modeled {{with the result that}} the magnetic structures responsible for these flares can be many stellar radii in extent. In this paper, we model the observed spectral energy distributions of these 32 stars in order to determine, in detail for each star, whether there is circumstellar disk material situated in sufficient proximity to the stellar surface for interaction with the large <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> inferred from the observed X-ray flares. Our spectral energy distributions span the wavelength range 0. 3 - 8 um (plus 24 um for some stars), allowing us to constrain the presence of dusty circumstellar material out to > 10 AU from the stellar surface in most cases. For 24 of the 32 stars in our sample the available data are sufficient to constrain the location of the inner edge of the dusty disks. Six of these (25 %) have spectral energy distributions consistent with inner disks within reach of the observed <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops.</b> Another four stars may have gas disks interior to the dust disk and extending within reach of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops,</b> but we cannot confirm this with the available data. The remaining 14 stars (58 %) appear to have no significant disk material within reach of the large flaring loops. Thus, up to ~ 40 % of the sample stars exhibit energetic X-ray flares that possibly arise from a magnetic star-disk interaction, and the remainder are evidently associated with extremely large, free-standing <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> anchored only to the stellar surface.

5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple disk {{clutches}} operate via an electrical actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a <b>magnetic</b> <b>loop,</b> which attracts both the armature and friction disks. The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the friction disks, transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a gear, coupling, or pulley via drive cup. The clutch slips until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|E

They consist of a coil of wire wound around a ferrite rod core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|E
40|$|We {{intend to}} {{investigate}} the underlying physics for the coronal rain phenomenon in a representative bipolar magnetic field, including the formation and the dynamics of coronal rain blobs. With the MPI-AMRVAC code, we performed three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with strong heating localized on footpoints of <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> after a relaxation to quiet solar atmosphere. Progressive cooling and in-situ condensation starts at the loop top due to radiative thermal instability. The first large-scale condensation on the loop top suffers Rayleigh-Taylor instability and becomes fragmented into smaller blobs. The blobs fall vertically dragging <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops</b> until they reach low beta regions and start to fall along the loops from loop top to loop footpoints. A statistic study of the coronal rain blobs finds that small blobs with masses of less than 10 ^ 10 g dominate the population. When blobs fall to lower regions along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loops,</b> they are stretched and develop a non-uniform velocity pattern with an anti-parallel shearing pattern seen to develop along the central axis of the blobs.
