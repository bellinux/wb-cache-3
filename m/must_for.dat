25|$|Maintainability: Maintainability {{includes}} {{the notion of}} adaptability, portability and transferability (from one development team to another). Measuring and monitoring maintainability is a <b>must</b> <b>for</b> mission-critical applications where change is driven by tight time-to-market schedules {{and where it is}} important for IT to remain responsive to business-driven changes. It is also essential to keep maintenance costs under control.|$|E

Exercise is a <b>must</b> <b>for</b> all diabetics. Walking twice a day for 30 minutes can be a fair substitute for those not engaged in intense gym activities. Losing weight is also beneficial as this {{has been shown to}} improve blood sugar control, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood pressure.|$|E

25|$|Bred to {{work the}} fields, Picards are very {{athletic}} and revel in exercise. A good deal of exercise is therefore a <b>must</b> <b>for</b> this breed. Otherwise boredom will give way to destructive behavior and rowdy play. They enjoy swimming, running beside a bike, and nice long walks. The Berger Picard makes an excellent jogging companion. The breed's intelligence and sensitivity have made it increasingly popular in dog sports such as agility trials, Tracking, obedience, showmanship, Schutzhund, Flyball, Lure coursing, French Ring Sport and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Picards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.|$|E
50|$|In fixed-limit games, {{the size}} of bets and raises is {{determined}} by the specified stakes. For example, in $3/$6 fixed limit hold 'em, during the first two betting rounds (preflop and flop) the big blind is $3, the opening bet after the flop <b>must</b> be <b>for</b> $3 and all raises <b>must</b> be <b>for</b> $3. For the last two betting rounds (turn and river) the opening bet <b>must</b> be <b>for</b> $6 and all raises <b>must</b> be <b>for</b> $6. As in no-limit and pot-limit games, these amounts will be over-ridden by table stakes rules (so for example, in $3/$6 fixed limit hold 'em a player could bet, raise or call for only $2 at any time if that is their remaining stake).|$|R

25|$|This breed {{requires}} expert veterinary {{attention in}} areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is a <b>must</b> <b>for</b> these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventative measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristics of the}} American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes {{it one of the}} most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a <b>must</b> <b>for</b> this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a <b>must.</b> <b>For</b> routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

25|$|McDevitt {{describes}} human civilization at {{the time}} of the back-story as spread across many worlds, most of which were independent of the others. All maintained sentimental ties with Earth, but difficulties of interstellar travel and local parochialism ensured that there was no central government. Many human worlds maintained their own armed forces but again there was no central direction. Communication between worlds was limited to travel by interstellar ships, which used magnetic drives for short and medium distance travel within star systems and Armstrong interstellar drives by means of which ships could travel between star systems through “Armstrong space”. Both {{at the time}} of the back-story and in the protagonist's time, navigation using Armstrong drives is sufficiently imprecise that ships <b>must</b> <b>for</b> safety reasons emerge from Armstrong space well away from stars and planets and travel substantial distances (and times) using magnetic drives. In addition, and partly as a result, travel through Armstrong space is time-consuming – as described in the novel, a voyage of 3,000 light years takes about seven months, of which about five months time is spent in Armstrong space. It is important to the story that some individuals, like Alex Benedict and most Ashiyyur, react physically badly to the transitions into and out of Armstrong space.|$|E
