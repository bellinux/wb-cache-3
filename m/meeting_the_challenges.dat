25|$|The 2004 Games {{were judged}} a success, as both {{security}} and organization worked well, {{and only a}} few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as Unforgettable, dream Games, by IOC President Jacques Rogge for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of holding the Olympic Games. The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5million tickets were sold there in 2000).|$|E
25|$|The capable {{coaching}} of John Kennedy aside, the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s were lean {{years for the}} Kangaroos. However, the rebuilding of the club was taking place. The Krakouer brothers (Jim and Phil) brought a spark into the side and lifted many hopes for North supporters and the excitement to the general football public. The innovative idea of night games was instigated by the club and <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges,</b> the club survived. One major highlight was the recruitment of forward John Longmire in 1989, who topped the club goalkicking over five consecutive seasons (1990–1994) and won the Coleman medal in 1990 with 98 goals. At {{the beginning of the}} 1993 season, in a dramatic and controversial move, the board of the club sacked coach and long-time player Wayne Schimmelbusch, and appointed Denis Pagan in his place. Results were immediate, as North reached the finals {{for the first time in}} nearly a decade.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{roles were}} sharply defined. Men were {{primarily}} responsible for breaking the land; planting and harvesting; building the house; buying, operating and repairing machinery; and handling finances. At first there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, {{but they had a}} hard time. They realized the need for a wife. In 1901, there were 19,200 families, but this surged to 150,300 families only 15 years later. Wives {{played a central role in}} settlement of the prairie region. Their labor, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges.</b> They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health. While prevailing patriarchal attitudes, legislation, and economic principles obscured women's contributions, the flexibility exhibited by farm women in performing productive and nonproductive labor was critical to the survival of family farms, and thus to the success of the wheat economy.|$|E

[...] The Gold Coast was composed of four regions, several former colonies amalgamated into one. Nkrumah sought to unite them under one nationality, and bring the country to independence. Key to <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> was convincing the British that the CPP's programmes were not only practical, but inevitable, and Nkrumah and Arden-Clarke worked closely together.

As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children.

2500|$|Released in July 2008, The Dark Knight broke several {{box office}} records and {{received}} both popular and critical accolades, {{especially with regard}} to Ledger's performance as the Joker. Even film critic David Denby, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] and Ledger as [...] "mesmerising in every scene", concluding: [...] "His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss." [...] Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend Christian Bale, who played opposite him as Batman, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as [...] "the most fun I've ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character." [...] Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it [...] "absolute nonsense" [...] and going on to say, [...] "Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I've ever met." ...|$|E
