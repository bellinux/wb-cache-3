2500|$|The {{producers}} {{felt that}} {{there were too many}} characters given the limitations of the half-hour sitcom format, and that the plot lines should be more focused to give the remaining girls more room for character development. Four of the original actresses—Julie Anne Haddock (Cindy), Julie Piekarski (Sue Ann), Felice Schachter (Nancy), and Molly Ringwald (Molly)—were written out of the show (although the four did make periodic guest appearances {{in the second and third}} seasons, and all but Molly Ringwald appeared in one [...] "reunion" [...] episode in the eighth season). Mr. Bradley's character was also dropped and replaced with a generally unseen headmaster named <b>Mr.</b> <b>Harris.</b> (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Harris</b> actually appeared in an early second-season episode, [...] "Gossip", played by Kenneth Mars) and Mr. Parker for the rest of the series. In addition to being housemother to the remaining girls, Mrs. Garrett became the school dietitian as the second season began. Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon), a new student originally from the Bronx, arrived at Eastland on scholarship. A run-in with the law forced the four to be separated from the other girls and work in the cafeteria, living together in a spare room next to Mrs. Garrett's bedroom.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be intellectuals and Bohemians, both here and abroad, as great poetry. [...] However, {{it was possible that}} we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If <b>Mr</b> <b>Harris</b> proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{listed in}} the {{on-screen}} credits for nearly twenty years as [...] "Doctor Who" [...] or [...] "Dr Who", the Doctor is seldom called by that name in the programme, except in a tongue-in-cheek manner. For example, in The Gunfighters the Doctor assumes the name of Doctor Caligari and subsequently responds to the question [...] "Doctor who?" [...] with [...] "yes, quite right". Question marks adorning his costuming in the 1980s seem to imply the [...] "Who" [...] moniker. The only real exceptions are the computer WOTAN in the serial The War Machines, which commands that [...] "Doctor Who is required" [...] and, {{towards the end of}} the Second Doctor serial Fury from the Deep, the Doctor is addressed as [...] "Doctor Who" [...] by <b>Mr</b> <b>Harris</b> during the dinner party. The Third Doctor's car, dubbed [...] "Bessie", carried the plate WHO 1, the only ongoing reference to the [...] "Doctor Who" [...] enigma in the original programme. The Third Doctor later drove an outlandish vehicle called the [...] "Whomobile" [...] in publicity materials, but it is never referred to as such in the programme, being simply known as [...] "the Doctor's car" [...] or [...] "my car", as the Doctor puts it. The name [...] "Doctor Who" [...] is used in the title of the serial Doctor Who and the Silurians, but this was a captioning error rather than an in-story mention. The only other time this occurs is in the title of episode five of The Chase, which is titled [...] "The Death of Doctor Who". In [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] (2017), the Doctor's old friend and archenemy the Master (Michelle Gomez) insists that the Doctor's real name is in fact Doctor Who, though he tries to reassure his companion that she is joking.|$|E
