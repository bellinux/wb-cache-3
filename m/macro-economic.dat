At a <b>macro-economic</b> level, Khatami continued the liberal policies that Rafsanjani had embarked {{on in the}} state's first five-year economic development plan (1990–1995). On 10 April 2005, Khatami cited economic development, large-scale operations {{of the private sector}} in the country's economic arena and the six percent economic growth as among the achievements of his government. He allocated $5 billion to the private sector for promoting the economy, adding that the value of contracts signed in this regard has reached $10 billion.|$|E
25|$|Under {{its unique}} <b>macro-economic</b> and {{political}} environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special telecommunications policy and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at full competition. As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China Unicom was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote fair competition in the paging service, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The general {{managers}} or {{directors of the}} National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia do not just function as business managers or administrators, {{given the fact that}} in furtherance of their normal business activities in running efficiently and effectively a private enterprise, they actively participate in the formulation and implementation of national policy for the coffee industry and they may substantially influence the <b>macro-economic</b> policy of the country. The general Managers have had a seat in the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República, in the Council of Economic and Social Policy (Consejo de Política Económica y Social) and in the Council of International Trade and Commerce. Furthermore, they direct and preside the diplomatic missions that represent the nation in international conferences and forums, which may influence foreign policy as well.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli economy {{withstood}} the late-2000s recession, registering positive GDP {{growth in}} 2009 and ending the decade with an unemployment rate {{lower than that}} of many western countries. There are several reasons behind this economic resilience, for example, the fact, as stated above, that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative <b>macro-economic</b> policies. Two policies in particular can be cited, one is the refusal of the government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their risky behavior. The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the banks' depository and investment banking activities, contrary to the then-opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions which had the effect of encouraging more risk-taking in the financial systems of those countries.|$|E

The model-derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly—the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by the model.

2500|$|Interest rate {{targets are}} a vital tool of {{monetary}} policy and {{are taken into}} account when dealing with variables like investment, inflation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a <b>macro-economic</b> policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market. [...] In developed economies, interest-rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} his {{dismissal}} from the Treasury, Sir Samuel Brittan wrote in the Financial Times that history was likely to record {{him as one of}} the better Chancellors, citing his structural reforms of taxation, his determination to give priority to securing and maintaining low inflation and the delayed tax increases in his final budget. [...] "He leaves behind an economy with a faster growth rate than that of any other of the main G7 countries and an underlying rate of inflation lower than in most." [...] According to Ruth Lea, writing 12 years later on the factors behind the subsequent performance of the British economy, Lamont had introduced path-breaking <b>macro-economic</b> reforms including inflation targeting and the first steps towards an independent Bank of England and had begun a programme of fiscal consolidation, which transformed the public finances. [...] "These macro economic reforms, along with the Thatcher economic reforms of the 1980s, effectively transformed the British economy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Erdoğan {{inherited}} a Turkish economy that {{was beginning to}} recover from a recession {{as a result of}} reforms implemented by Kemal Derviş. Erdoğan supported Finance Minister Ali Babacan in enforcing <b>macro-economic</b> policies. Erdoğan tried to attract more foreign investors to Turkey and lifted many government regulations. The cash-flow into the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita; considerably higher numbers were commonly advertised but these did not account for the inflation of the US dollar between 2002 and 2012. The average annual growth in GDP per capita was 3.6%. The growth in real GDP between 2002 and 2012 was higher than the values from developed countries, but was close to average when developing countries are also taken into account. The ranking of the Turkish economy in terms of GDP moved slightly from 17 to 16 during this decade. A major consequence of the policies between 2002 and 2012 was the widening of the current account deficit from 600 million USD to 58 billion USD (2013 est.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2005, {{the head}} of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Dr. Gideon Gono, {{announced}} that Zimbabwe would have a new currency the following year, and new banknotes and coins would be produced. However, in June 2006, it was decreed that, for a new currency to be viable, Zimbabwe had to first achieve <b>macro-economic</b> stability (i.e., double digit inflation). Instead, in August 2006, the first dollar was redenominated to the second dollar at the rate of 1000 first dollars to 1 second dollar (1000:1). At the same time, the currency was devalued against the US dollar, from 101000 first dollars (101 once revalued) to 250 second dollars, a decrease of about 60% (see exchange rate history table below). ISO originally assigned a new currency code of ZWN to this redenominated currency, but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change, so the currency code remained 'ZWD'. The revaluation campaign, which Gideon Gono named [...] "Operation Sunrise", was completed on 21 August 2006. It was estimated that some ten trillion old Zimbabwe dollars (22% of the money supply) were not redeemed during this period.|$|E

2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked."

[...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our <b>macro-economic</b> performance." ...|$|E

Particularly, the EFSF’s mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to the Eurozone’s <b>macro-economic</b> adjustment programme (2) the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was signed on 2 February 2012, after a decision taken by the European Council (December 2010). Designed as a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the countries of the Euro area, the ESM issues debt instruments in order to finance loans and other forms of financial assistance to the involved Member States; finally, (3) the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), whose final version was signed on 2 March 2012 by the leaders of all euro area members and eight other EU member states, and entered into force on 1 January 2013. The TSCG has been commonly labeled [...] "Fiscal Compact [...] ", originally intended to promote the launch of a new international economic cooperation enforced by those EU Member States which are also part of the so-called.|$|E
