5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} morale. Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E
5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after {{he considered the}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops. Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the peace}} accords Guatemala has had both {{economic}} growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2015. In the 2015 elections, Jimmy <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Convergence Front won the presidency. He assumed office on 14 January 2016.|$|R

5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, {{so as to avoid}} any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The American colonists {{met their}} goal of {{strengthening}} {{the siege of}} Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from {{the reach of the}} British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonial forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{lifted the}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian princes of Europe and was {{recognized}} as a great victory over the Muslim Ottoman Empire.

50|$|A Congressional Commission {{took it upon}} {{themselves}} to investigate the allegations. <b>The</b> Commission <b>of</b> Control of Public Revenue and Expenditure (Comisión de Control del Ingreso y el Gasto Público) summoned Figueres. On 6 September 2005, Judge Maria <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Circuit Court of Costa Rica pronounced a ruling in Figueres' favour, and against the Congressional Commission's procedures. The Commission also failed to register a report on the findings before the Congress, as stipulated in Congressional Procedural Regulations.|$|R

5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} to threaten the Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
500|$|The film {{states that}} locals soon started buying guns and locks, {{but this did}} not happen until two months later in May.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} level <b>of</b> <b>morale</b> among <b>the</b> {{employees}} in the plywood industry setting. The study mainly concentrates on the dimensions such as individual role, group role, welfare measures, employee-employer relationship, employee-employee relationship in respect to the demographic variables. <b>The</b> primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study was to}} identify <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee in the small industry. And it also suggests various measures to build high morale there possible. The data for the research work was collected through <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> questionnaire schedule. To prove the research hypothesis the various tests such as chi-square, and ANOVAare being used. After applying these tests the researcher came to a conclusion that half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee has high <b>morale</b> and rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half has low morale...|$|R
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews {{were assigned to the}} same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948. As England made 496runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23, caught down the leg side, and Jim Laker for four. During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for {{maintaining}} a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing {{in concert with the}} bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests. Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity would affect the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the teams}} were {{successful}} in raising money for charity, their main purpose was to help sustain <b>morale.</b> Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> services and civil defence organisations had their own teams, some of them national and featuring first-class players.|$|R
50|$|As things happened, <b>the</b> {{constant}} raids <b>of</b> Royalist guerrillas, <b>the</b> harshness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain, <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> promised reinforcements from Antioquia, and {{the delays}} in bringing up his army's artillery contributed to weakening <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops under Nariño's command, {{when they had}} practically reached <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Pasto.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} several decades, social {{movements}} have spread all across Latin America, sparking hope for change. This thesis analyzes <b>the</b> well-organized mobilizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous people <b>of</b> Bolivia and how {{they have been able}} to incorporate themselves in state apparatuses, including <b>the</b> election <b>of</b> its first indigenous president, Evo <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Movement towards Socialism (MAS) party. The case studied her provides insight into the processes if how political representation was achieved by Bolivia 2 ̆ 7 s indigenous people who were for centuries excluded from the political, social and economic arena. It also analyzes <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> <b>Morales</b> 2 ̆ 7 policy changes from 2006 to 2009 as a way to examine how they have impacted <b>the</b> marginalized status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous people. Ultimately this thesis will trace <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> social movements, especially MAS, and how they transformed the Bolivian society from below...|$|R
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defending troops.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was released in 1999 which features Vives and a band performing song with various background montages. Vives performed the song at the 12th Lo Nuestro Awards which Magaly <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun-Sentinel noted that his performance [...] "sent everybody up on their feet, swinging their hips". The song was included on his El Amor de Mi Tour track listing. He also performed the song at the 1st Latin Grammy Awards ceremony where Joan Anderman <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Boston Globe said that Vives [...] "brought the performances to an upbeat close". He was originally not going to perform at the Latin Grammy Awards due to his illness with pneumonia, but decided to go as {{he wanted to show}} [...] "something that was mine and that was my country's".|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Playbach Studios and Música Satánica Studios in San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as Circle House Studios in Miami, Florida. It was mixed at Circle House Studios and Zeitgeist Sound Studios in Long Island, New York. The phrase [...] "entren los que quieran" [...] has been translated as [...] "everyone is welcome". Visitante explained that <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album means that [...] "Everyone’s invited to enter. If you don’t want to, well don’t." [...] Ed <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Daily News interpreted the album's title as [...] "an invitation to like-minded Latino youth to a safe space for rebellion." [...] The album's artwork features illustrations of explosives; Billboard writer Judy Cantor Navas opined that this [...] "simultaneously exceeded and parodied [...] reputation as provocateur".|$|R
