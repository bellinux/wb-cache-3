40|$|Summary High oil prices, {{increased}} {{reliance on}} imported oil, and environmental concerns {{have led to}} calls for <b>mandating</b> the blending of domestically-produced ethanol with petrol (‘fuel ethanol’). The most common proposal is for a blend with 10 per cent by volume of ethanol (E 10). <b>Mandate</b> advocates cite fuel security, a smaller trade deficit resulting from lower oil imports, regional development, and environmental benefits as reasons for adopting a <b>mandate.</b> Concern that the domestic industry {{would not be able}} to compete with imports is also a factor behind the calls for a <b>mandate.</b> Reduced oil imports are only one effect of an ethanol <b>mandate</b> on the trade account. Any diversion of feedstock from exports or increased imports of feedstock needed to meet the <b>mandate</b> would increase the trade deficit. A <b>mandate</b> is only one way of reducing reliance on imported oil. Importing ethanol, for example, would be less economically costly than a <b>mandate,</b> and would diversify geographic supply sources and the composition of fuel. The evidence suggests that the costs of creating jobs under an E 10 <b>mandate</b> would be high. A <b>mandate</b> could also adversely affect other rural industries. The Biofuels Taskforce that the Howard Government established concluded that greenhouse gas benefits alone would not warrant further assisting biofuels given the availability of much cheaper carbon reduction options. The additional demand for feedstock under a <b>mandate</b> might lead to competition for land from other uses such as food and exports. Views differ on the potential for competition for land use in Australia. A <b>mandate</b> could benefit the economy if domestic ethanol could compete with imports without government assistance. Even though a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of an ethanol <b>mandate</b> has not been undertaken, no prima facie economic case for a <b>mandate</b> has been established...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} EU trade policy and more specically at the {{negotiating}} <b>mandate</b> the Council must grant the Commission to start trade negotiations. The negotiating <b>mandate</b> {{is a set of}} directives that impose limits to the proposals the Commission can make. As such the <b>mandate</b> is legally binding and defendable in a court of justice. However, authors such as Kerremans (2004 b) and Damro (2007) also point out a di¤erent {{way of looking at the}} <b>mandate</b> by arguing that it sets out the maximum concessions the Council is willing to make during trade talks and that the <b>mandate</b> can thus be considered a signaling device. In this paper I analyze this proposed second role of the negotiating <b>mandate</b> in EU trade policy making by decoupling the two perspectives on the negotiating <b>mandate.</b> The results of the model show that when individual Council members can communicate with the Commission, there exists a signaling equilibrium in which the Commission complies with the <b>mandate.</b> nrpages: 14 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>mandated</b> disclosure {{on the design of}} contracts and induced behavior in the presence of career concerns. We analyze the impact of two key properties of a <b>mandated</b> performance measure that is publicly disclosed: its sensitivity to the agent's effort and its informativeness about the agent's ability. We find that when the <b>mandated</b> measure is highly sensitive to the agent’s effort but the measure is relatively uninformative about the agent's ability, the agent's effort (and the firm’s output) will be higher and the pay-for-performance sensitivity will be lower relative to a scenario in which the measure is not <b>mandated.</b> In contrast, if the <b>mandated</b> measure’s informativeness dominates the measure’s sensitivity to effort, then effort is lower and the pay-for-performance sensitivity is higher in the <b>mandated</b> setting. We also characterize settings where a <b>mandated</b> disclosure would be desirable or not; variations arise because <b>mandated</b> disclosures can increase both effort and risk. Our results imply that <b>mandating</b> the public disclosure of performance measures, particularly measures that are relatively informative about ability but are difficult to influence through managerial effort, may have the unintended consequence of generating inefficiencies in firms' employment contracts. 1 1...|$|R
