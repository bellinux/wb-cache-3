Collins and Sumner then recruited Wilderness Society President Olaus Murie and his wife Margaret Murie into an effort to permanently protect the area. In 1956, Olaus and Mardy Murie led an expedition to the Brooks Range in northeast Alaska, where they dedicated an entire summer to studying the land and wildlife ecosystems of the Upper Sheenjek Valley. The conclusion resulting from these studies was an ever deeper sense of the importance of preserving the area intact, a determination that would play an instrumental part in the decision to designate the area as Wilderness in 1960.

40|$|Based on {{the case}} study of {{peripheral}} urban areas in Beijing, this paper aims to identify the factors which will influence the spatial distribution of pen-urban recreation areas, by analyzing the collected data from questionnaires, online survey, documentation and field investigations (2007). In order to achieve sound information, relevant data from different management departments, owners and land-use types {{involved in the case}} study area are collected. A sampling database for pen-urban recreation areas in Beijing is established, and GIS spatial analyses as well as statistic analyses are applied. The result indicates that spatial distribution of recreation areas is majorly influenced by four factors, e. g. tourism attractions and environmental conditions, policy and spatial governance, consumption demand and preference, land price and availability. Tourism attractions and environmental conditions are dominant factors for public recreation areas. Commercial recreation areas are highly related with accessibility. Agricultural recreation areas are usually attached to special farmlands near large-scaled scenic areas. Meanwhile, recreational business clusters have appeared in suburbs influenced by <b>mass</b> <b>recreation</b> market growth. Controlled by the land price, commercial recreation areas are differentiated on their scales and developing intensity. Policy and spatial governance have made arrangements of recreation areas more balancing and more human-oriented. A pen-urban recreation area model is therefore established {{on the basis of this}} analysis, which can guide urban planning and designing, land-use planning and recreation resource development...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{conflicts over}} Jamaica Bay, a 25, 000 -acre estuarine lagoon bordering southern Brooklyn and Queens {{that at the}} end of the nineteenth century was one of the largest undeveloped areas in New York City. Determining the relationship between city and nature was the central conflict in the bay’s history. While activists, developers, and officials sought to transform the bay into parks, suburbs, and a port, local residents fought to maintain their homes in what they envisioned as the Venice of New York—an unconventional hybrid space of city and nature. By examining the interplay of competing conceptions of Jamaica Bay over its history, this study will show how both elite and working class New Yorkers were able to exercise power over the bay’s development and the complex ways in which its spaces were understood. Tensions peaked in 1969 with the creation of Gateway National Recreation Area, one of the first urban sites run by the National Park Service dedicated to preservation and <b>mass</b> <b>recreation.</b> As they had done before, elites invoked class- based arguments against residents’ use and care of the bay but the changing politics of the 1960 s reversed the dynamic, leading to the bay’s inhabitants winning the right to continue living within its spaces. The victory of Jamaica Bay’s residents codified their vision of a hybrid space, forcing Gateway’s administrators to approach the conceptualization of their park in novel ways...|$|E
40|$|Two {{questions}} set {{the course}} for my research into the Dutch pleasure boating. 1. How could an elite pastime like water sport develop into <b>mass</b> <b>recreation?</b> 2. How do the economical, cultural and nautical elite with their historical claim to "good taste", manage to make themselves distinguishable from ordinary pleasure boaters? The history of pleasureboating can be devided in four eras. Part 1 : 1622 - 1846. This period commenced {{with the establishment of}} the first marina in Amsterdam and ended with the foundation of the country's first water sport club. Part II: 1846 - 1900. In 1846 a new era began. In that year, at the instigation of Prince Hendrik, the second son of King Willem II, the Royal Dutch Yacht Club was founded in Rotterdam. Part III: 1900 - 1945. This was a phase of development characterised by the building of manageable and relatively cheap boats such as the wherry, the canoe, the open sailing boat and the cabin sailing boat. The growing enthusiasm for affordable self-built vessels went hand in hand with this. After 1900 the first boats with a petrol engine appeared on the water. The "fast machine" was a shining symbol of the technical developments and it attracted new groups to the water sport. Part IV: 1945 - 2011. This period, encompassing the baby boom generation, saw the last phase of the popularisation of pleasure boating. In 1950 there were roughly 20, 000 cabin boats in the Netherlands, by 1975 the number had grown to 140, 000. The number of water sport clubs also increased dramatically. Water sport has a good pedigree. For a long time owning a pleasure yacht was in particular the ultimate distinguishing symbol of nobility and good taste. But water sport popularised and expanded and lower social class appeared on the water and the water sport clubs. The question arose to what extent "good taste" still plays a role as a means of distinction on the water...|$|E

It seeks to place the initiative in the broader context of the social issues that were highlighted by the Ministry's establishment. Those issues included the role of politics in sport, the belief that recreation belonged to the private rather then public domain, the relevance of <b>mass</b> national <b>recreation,</b> and the appropriate public financial assistance for national, regional and local sports organisations. The Labour Party had a long-standing belief that part of government's social welfare responsibilities was to assist voluntary organisations in the promotion and administration of physical fitness. This physical welfare ideal reached back at least to the Savage Government which established the Physical Welfare and Recreation Branch of the Department of Internal Affairs. In the years between Labour administrations, the National Party, opted for a much more limited commitment to recreation and sport, based on its belief that politics and sport should remain separate. National Governments between 1949 and 1972 made very restricted use of the Physical Welfare and Recreation Branch...|$|R

40|$|Deltas are {{of great}} {{importance}} to humans all over the world. They are densely populated coastal areas, where land arises from sea. An amazing gradient where two worlds meet and nature and humans proliferate traditionally. Yet this gradient increasingly disappears due to the great technical advances since the 19 th century, which tried to control the marine dynamics of deltas to ensure safety of the hinterland against inundation. The Deltaworks in the Netherlands embody this. The masterpiece of the Deltaworks meant {{the construction of a}} national icon: the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, which does not only withstand storm surges, but even daily controls the tides of the sea in the Eastern Scheldt. However, this permeable dam has resulted in the erosion of the intertidal area and subsequently in an insatiable demand of sand, which increases annually due to sea-level rise. The intertidal area will have disappeared in about 2080 as a consequence of this sand hunger, with major social - and ecological problems as a result. Besides sand hunger, Zeeland also suffers from space hunger. The rise of <b>mass</b> <b>recreation</b> in the past century has led to the cluttering of holiday parks in the hinterland of the delta, which destroy the lowlands and the delta in their vastness. Therefore, a holistic solution for the Zeeland delta does not only secure the intertidal area, but also encompasses the finding of a suitable place for recreation in its delta. This is achieved by means of the deconstruction of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier and Grevelingendam, and using the resulting new marine dynamics to promote the social - and ecological situation of the Eastern Scheldt. The new multifunctional coastal defense systems protect the hinterland from inundation permanently and is in itself a new landscape entity of Zeeland in which the function of recreation becomes integrated into the landscape. This way Zeeland is strengthened integrally between sea and land and the Eastern Scheldt is transformed from a nature - to a human reserve, where all interactions live together as an obviousness.

40|$|These {{days the}} {{definition}} of ‘public spaces’ has shifted from its traditionally meaning of streets, squares, and parks in an urban context to the new collective space with programmatic functionalization. Designers, urban planers, and policy-makers are trying to re-think and redesign public space according to these new forms of sociability. We are interested in evaluating and (re) defining the spatial and social interrelations {{and the meaning of}} public spaces {{in the context of the}} new social and spatial patterns of the network society and space-time behavior in the Network City. This paper therefore aims at reviewing recent transformations of public space in postsocialist cities which organization shifted from top-down planned management conducted by government to bottom-up management by private investors. The townscape in recent years of reform is gradually facing the emergence of consumption space: chain of stores, supermarkets, shopping centers, and malls. These new spaces are designed to stimulate a sense of a new way of life, to target those who can afford it. However, increasing spatial segregation and dispersed activities generate contradictions between the city centralities. The contemporary city can be understood as an Archipelago of Enclaves (1) where citizens create their ‘own network city’. That is a consequence of the substantial expansion of the middle class which is characterized by increasing mobility and connectivity, mass consumption and <b>mass</b> <b>recreation.</b> New highly dynamic ‘time-space’ patterns of citizens represent a combination of the various places that are important for that individual. It means that different groups in society follow different paths through space and time with as little as possible friction with others. The selective consumption of places by every individual influences and alters the meaning and the nature of public space. In this context, the contemporary design of the ‘meaning’ of public space should concentrate on the issue in which way spatial, social and physical coherence is experienced, in which way different places relate to each other. The emphasis on the connecting interface between different ‘enclaves’ – ‘space as a system of places’ - can produce a valuable meaning of public space in a socially-inclusive way...|$|E

The city, Krivoy Rog, has a population of over 700, 000 people. Large areas of the city have undergone dramatic transformation. Industrial and and residential areas of the city are located around the reservoir. The shores of the reservoirs are subject to recreational loading. The natural landscape here is a combination of steppe habitats and scubland [...] The material for this study was collected in the breeding seasons of 1996, 1999, 2012, 2015. The number and distribution of birds were determined by registrations of birds along transects. The diversity index, dominance and evenness of species distribution in the breeding bird communities were compared for different habitats and different years. In breeding season 73 bird species belonging to 15 orders were found on the territory of the reservoir. Of these, 62 species bred, and 11 more used the area for foraging but bred in adjacent habitats. 24 species were present in winter. The average density of the breeding birds per species increased from 1. 8 ± 0. 4 pairs/km of survey route in 1996 to 3. 2 ± 0. 8 pairs/km in 2015. The dominant species in the breeding bird communities were Passer montanus L., Sturnus vulgaris L., Parus major L., Fulica atra L., Podiceps cristatus L. In the period 1996 – 1999 the habitat conditions in the territory of the water reservoir changed. These changes were associated with <b>mass</b> <b>recreation</b> of city residents here. The changes resulted in a stressful situation for the habitats and the bird communities. The changes resulted in an imbalance in the development of the bird communities. Since 2012 the birds adapted to the new environmental conditions and formed a new community. By 2015, the species diversity of birds had increased, the degree of pressure on the dominant species and the species distribution of the species had leveled off. The number of bird species nesting in the habitats of the water reservoir had increased. Within the bird communities ground and cavity nesting birds were replaced by woodland-nesting species. Transformation of bird habitat had a decisive impact on the development of the community of nesting birds. The differences in ecological characteristics of the community of birds were expressed along the gradient of transformation of habitats: the proportion of ground-nesting species in the community fell, species diversity was reduced, the dominant species increased their pressure on the bird community and and the distribution of of species abundance became more uniform. Against the background of these changes, the diversity of breeding species increased in the tree plantations, as compared to transformed natural habitats. This is evidence, that the development of the bird communities in artificially created habitats and development of bird communities in transformed habitats takes place in different ways and in different directions...|$|E

However there are different ways of realization and self-identification for factually every man of marked individuality. The remarkable thing is that personality which aims to attain public confession and support of wide public, with a necessity must demonstrate willingness to incarnate constructs expected by society, which function in mass consciousness as a public ideal. However achievement methods of such constructs can radically disaccord up to choosing of diametrically opposite and mutually exclusive directions. At the level of mass consciousness such methods, as a rule, are interpreted as two opposite ways for achievement of select purpose. The first way is expounded as humane, altruistic, and focused on creative work and social activity of society. The other one is opposite, which manifest itself by destruction, cruelty and devastation, the eventual result of which is stagnancy and even destruction of all frame of society.

5000|$|Founded in 1905, {{it is one}} of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Diocese of Providence. The current {{building}} was designed in 1915 by Providence architect John F. O'Malley in the Gothic Revival style.It was at the close of the 19th century, at a time when the weaving industry in New England began to prosper, that the Polish people were attracted to Central Falls, Valley Falls, Pawtucket and other vicinities in the state of Rhode Island. The first Polish people came to Central Falls and settled in the vicinity of High Street. Since no Church was available for their use, they found it necessary to attend services on Sundays and special Feast days in neighboring Churches and others, who were in a position to do so, traveled as far as St. Adalbert's in Providence to fulfill their spiritual obligations. Occasionally the people would be visited by Father Duczmal from Providence, who would try to attend to what- ever spiritual needs were necessary.The colony grew rapidly. On November 11, 1900, the Polish people organized themselves into [...] "St. Joseph's Brotherly Aid Society." [...] In this Society it was suggested that a parish be organized. With this aim in mind a special committee was selected, headed by Szczepan Pokraka. The Most Reverend Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence at that time, accepted the petition of the Society and conceded to assist them in organizing a parish, requesting simultaneously a census to be taken of all the Polish people in this vicinity. The results of this census indicated that there were two hundred Polish families in the vicinity of Central Falls. Pawtucket and Valley Falls. Actual organization of the new parishwas entrusted to Rev. Francis Kiuger.Rev. Francis Kluger was born on April 22, 1880, in Siemianowice, Gorny Slask, Poland. He received his elementary education in the local schools; his college and Philosophy courses in Italy; his Theological courses in the American College of Louvain, Belgium. He was ordained to the Priesthood on June 28, 1905. In August of that year he arrived in Providence and was assigned by the Most Rev. Bishop Harkins to organize a parish in Quidnick (West Warwick) R. I. His work in Quidnick lasted for only fifteen months and he was assigned to Central Falls for the purpose of organizing a parish here. Rev. Dr. Marion Nowicki replaced Fr. Kluger in Quidnick.St. Joseph's Parish of Central Falls was organized and became a legal Corporation on Dec. 6, 1906. The first Trustees were Jan Rzepiela and Jan Bozek. There was no parish house and no parish Church. For two years Fr. Kiuger made his residence on 60 Cross Street, Central Falls. The difficult task of parish organization began. The. Polish people frequently assembled for their Services in the hail of Sacred Heart Church in Pawtucket. In March 1907 Fr. Kiuger purchased a wooden building on High Street known as Temperance Hall. It was theatrical in structure with an upper balcony. The cost of purchasing and renovation amounted to approximately $10,000. St. Joseph, who was the Patron of the Brotherly Aid Society, became the Patron Saint of the Church and Parish:In the basement of the church a school was opened. Three teachers staffed the school: an elderly lady whose name is unknown, an organist, Mr. Krawczyk, and the pastor, Fr. Kluger. In 1909 Fr. Kluger purchased a beautiful building on 353 High Street and designated that to be used as a Rectory. Today this building forms part of the present school.The parish grew rapidly and the Church became much too small to accommodate all its worshippers. In 1915 land was purchased on Clay Street with the Most Rev. Bishop's permission to build a new brick Church at a cost of $45,000. The building of a new Church was hurried by a fire which broke out shortly after midnight on Easter Monday, caused by a boiler explosion, which destroyed the entire wooden structure. Services now were conducted in the Church hall of St. Basil's Church on Broad Street, Central Falls.The new building project was swift, since the following Easter all services were taking place in the church hall of the new Church. The main Altar, still found in the Church today, was purchased from Holy Trinity Church in Central Falls. The new Church, of Gothic structure, is large and beautiful. The unique front makes it very impressive. The gracious steeple which was the admiration of many, was built by Fr. Malecki and was destroyed during the 1954 hurricane.Rev. Fr. Kluger conducted the new church building project alone. In 1916 he was assisted for only several months by Rev. Peter Switala. In November 1917 Fr. Kiuger was transferred to St. Mary's Parish in Quidnick as Pastor.The second Pastor was Rev. Lawrence Malecki, born July 14, 1882, in Franklin, Pennsylvania. His early education was obtained in LaSalle, Illinois; College and Theological Studies at SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary (at that time) in Detroit, MI. In 1910 he was ordained a Priest and worked in Fall River, Massachusetts, Quidnick (West Warwick) RI and then was appointed Pastor of St. Joseph's Parish in Central Falls.The parish debt amounted to $56,000.00 at that time. Father Malecki, through his amiable disposition, priestly life and charity, gained the confidence and cooperation of all his parishioners. The times during that period were considered good and the church building project was nearing completion.Solemn blessing of the Church took place on July 6, 1919, by Most Reverend Bishop Hickey, coadjutor of the diocese, in the presence of Rt. Rev. Msgr. Peter Blessing, diocesan vicar-general, and a large representation of the clergy from Central Falls and vicinities. The program commenced with a procession of Church and Civil organizations through High Street to Main Street, Pawtucket, where Bishop Hickey was met, greeted and led to the Church.On that same day the Most Reverend Bishop administered the Sacrament of Confirmation to a group of 450 children. After the Sacrament of Confirmation was administered, Bishop Hickey, in an eloquent sermon, encouraged the faithful to acquaint themselves with the American language, customs and institutions, simultaneously preserving their beautiful national traditions and language. A thought indeed noble, practical and worthy of every consideration in our present day.The parochial school, which was located in the parish hall at that time, welcomed graciously the arrival of the four Bernardine Sisters from Reading, Pennsylvania, in the Fall of 1918. From that time on the Bernardine Sisters have staffed the school. For three years the Sisters resided in a rented house near the church. In 1921 the Rev. Pastor purchased a home on 339 High Street and renovated it for convent dwelling and purposes. That same year a house on 355 High Street was bought and became a new rectory site, whereas the former rectory was converted to a school. In the Fall of 1921 a new and proper additional wing was added to the former rectory, thus making that building a renovated and well-constructed school for the children at a cost of $27000.In February 1925 the interior of the Church was painted. The decorations were beautiful, rich in color and the painted pictures of high artistic calibre still remain untouched and in their original status, constantly admired by all the visitors, regardless from where they may come. The chandeliers were imported from Poland by Father Malecki and donated to the parish by the Rosary Society.In 1931 the Silver jubilee of the parish was observed. The parochial status at that time was considered very good spiritually as well as materially. The parishioners now rejoiced with a beautiful church, a convenient and spacious school, a convent and a rectory. The parishioners of St. Joseph's were indeed grateful to Father Malecki for his zealous and untiring efforts. The manifold blessings of Almighty God and the unending generosity of the parishioners brought a dream long desired to reality.The following priests have assisted Fr. Lawrence' Malecki in his pastoral duties: Rev. W. Kapturkiewicz, Rev. B. S. Rosiak, Rev. F. Wilk, Rev. W. Rozpad, Rev. J. Szymczyk, Rev. J. Borek. Other priests, who assisted occasionally, were Rev. Jastroch, Rev. Kaszynski, Rev. Dr. Rolbiecki and Rev. Tyzynski.Father Malecki rejoiced with a good and healthy life, however, shortly before his death he began to fail rapidly. On July 4, 1934, at the age of 52-24 years of his priestly life terminated he was called by his Divine Master. He was buried in St. Leon's Cemetery in Pound, WI. His successor was Rev. Peter Switala.Rev. Peter Switala was born August 2, 1883, in Jaskolki, Poznan, Poland. He received his early education in Jaskolki and his high school education in a German High School in Ostrowo, Poland; his philosophy course in Petit Seminaire, St. Trond and theology in the American College of Louvain, Belgium. He was ordained to the priesthood on July 8, 1908. Immediately after ordinations he came to America and began his priestly duties in Warren, RI, later in Central Falls and Woonsocket. In 1920 he was appointed Pastor of St. Adalbert's, Providence. In 1934, upon the death of Fr. Malecki, he was assigned to St. Joseph's Church, Central Falls, as Pastor.The new pastor planned to build a parish auditorium and make proper renovations to the parish buildings. Difficult economic conditions prevented Fr. Switala from fulfilling his plans. The great depression curbed material prosperity of the parish for many years.The beautiful church was in need of a new organ. In 1938 an organ, valued at $15,000.00, was purchased and shortly after installation the blessing of the new organ took place.During Fr. Switala's Pastoral administration, he had Rev. Peter Dobek and Rev. Michael Dziob as assistants; likewise the Franciscan Fathers Conventual assisting when needed. In 1937 parochial organizations such as Scouting and CYO activities were under way.Fr. Switala died on May 12, 1944, of a heart attack and was buried in St. Francis Cemetery, Pawtucket. The fourth pastor appointed to St. Joseph's is Rev. Peter P. Dobek, born July 4, 1906, in Wilmington, DE, where he attended St. Hedwig's parochial school and the Salesian High School in the same city. His college and philosophical studies were at St. Mary's College, Orchard Lake, MI, and for the last two years of his theological studies he attended St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, MD. He was ordained to the Priesthood May 21, 1932, in Philadelphia, PA, by His Eminence Dennis Cardinal Dougherty.As a curate he served in the following parishes: St. Philomena's, Narragansett, for six months; St. Joseph's, Pawtucket, for three months and St. Adalbert's, Providence, for one and one-half years. In October 1934 he was assigned to St. Joseph's, Central Falls, as curate for ten years and after the death of Fr. Switala he was assigned Pastor of St. Joseph's.Fr. Dobek as the new Pastor was confronted with many tasks. The parish buildings were in need of repairs and improvements. The parish debt at that time was only $14,000. Preparations were being made for an observance of a 40th anniversary of the parish. The first project was Church improvements. Second was a drive for funds to pay the remaining debt on the parish. The people responded very well so that within one year's time all parish debts were paid. The success of these projects are attributed to the able administration of Fr. Dobek, the constant generosity of the good people of the parish and the wonderful economic status throughout the country, which America enjoys and continues to share at present.In 1946 the 40th Anniversary of the parish took place. The Holy Sacrifice of Mass was offered by Rev. P. P. Dobek in the presence of Most Rev. Francis P. Keough, D.D., and numerous priests. The sermon was preached by Rev. John Dziok, a former parishioner of the parish. A banquet followed the <b>Mass</b> at Coats' <b>Recreation</b> Hall, Central Falls, in which 800 people participated.With the church tended to, the work of improvements in the church hall, school convent and rectory followed. The church hail was painted, a new boiler bought, new chairs, tables and kitchen equipment was obtained.The school, consisting of ten classrooms, was painted on the interior and exterior, new seats and new lights were obtained. The renovation of the Convent, a new boiler there, painting, new furniture and other objects amounted to a cost of $21,000. All these expenses were paid for without incurring debt.In the meantime the parish property expanded. In 1947 a home was purchased on High and Clay Streets and in 1949 an adjacent house was also purchased in that locality and which was transformed into a kindergarten school of two large and spacious rooms. In 1948 a beautiful memorial was dedicated in honor of all the young men who have sacrificed their lives in defense of our Country during the Second World War.In 1955 the great renovation project got underway in preparation for the observance of the Golden jubilee of the parish. In the spring of 1956 a new front was erected at the Church at a cost of $14,000. During the summer months renovation of the roof and pointing of the church took place.In 1957 the work of a complete interior renovation commenced. The painting was accomplished by Roman Przybylski of Gloucester, Mass., at a cost of $19,000.00. Two new confessionals were installed, windows renovated, a new lighting system, organ reparations, a new look to the vestibule of the church and the choir, new sacristy cabinets and new doors of the church became a reality. The complete expenses of the Golden jubilee preparations amounted to $80,000.00.Assisting Fr. Dobek in his Pastoral work in the parish were Rev. Michael Dziob, Rev. Peter Narewski, Rev. Eugene Konopka, Rev. Matthew Strumski and presently assisting is Rev. Frederick V. Slota with the Franciscan Fathers from Canton, MA, assisting in the parish work on week-ends.
