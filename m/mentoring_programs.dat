40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of self-efficacy in the relationship between <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> practices and mentee outcomes using 196 usable questionnaires collected from students studying in institutions of higher learning in Sarawak, Malaysia. The outcomes of stepwise regression analysis showed two important findings; firstly, the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> practices (i. e., communication, participation and support) is insignificantly correlated with psycho social. Secondly, the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> practices (i. e., communication, participation and support) is significantly correlated with academic performance. Statistically, this result confirms that the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> practices has not been an important predictor of psycho social but the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> practice has been an important predictor of academic performance in the organizational sample...|$|R
