40|$|Single and {{two-phase}} {{heat transport}} {{systems for the}} thermal control of large space facilities require fluid lines that traverse joints and either rotate or move in some other manner. Flexible hoses are being considered as one means of traversing these joints. To test the resilience of flexible hoses to bending stress, a test assembly was constructed {{to determine the number}} of flexing cycles the hoses could withstand before losing their ability to maintain a constant pressure. Corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> and Teflon hoses were tested at different pressures with nitrogen gas. The <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> had lives ranging from 30, 000 to 100, 000 flexing cycles.

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>hoses</b> resist high {{pressures}} and offer maximum tightness {{on account of}} the material from which they are manufactured. Their flexibility lends them tensile and tear strength. Also, they are characterised by their corrosion and pressure resistance, even under extreme conditions such as when exposed to aggressive seawater, strong vibrations and extreme temperatures such as in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas.|$|R

50|$|To {{increase}} pressure resistance, <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> can {{be equipped}} with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the hose fittings on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure. Due to its inherent flexibility, the braid moulds itself perfectly to {{the movement of the}} hose. Hose braiding consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually {{the same as that of}} the corrugated hose. It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.|$|R

50|$|A <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> is a {{flexible}} metal line element. There {{are two basic}} types of <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> that differ in their design and application: stripwound hoses and corrugated hoses. Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). Corrugated hoses can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. Corrugated hoses also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|E
50|$|Emil Witzenmann, son of Heinrich Witzenmann, {{developed}} {{a form of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> in 1909 that eliminated the need {{for any kind of}} sealing thread, be it of rubber, textile fibre or asbestos. In this type of hose, the strip edges do not interlock but abut each other and are seamlessly welded together. In 1920, Emil Witzenmann invented the metal expansion joint. This invention was based on the double-walled, welded, corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> (with a wound protection sheath) with radial flexibility. In 1929, it became possible {{for the first time to}} produce metal bellows. These were also developed by Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, but independently of Witzenmann.|$|E
50|$|Stripwound hoses {{are created}} by {{helically}} winding cold-rolled, profiled metal strip onto a mandrel where the helical coils are interconnected but remain movable due {{to the type of}} profiling. This principle of a movable connection between the profiled coils leads to the high flexibility and movability of <b>metal</b> stripwound <b>hoses.</b> Most strips are made of galvanized steel, stainless steel or brass, which can optionally be chromium- or nickel-plated.|$|R
5000|$|In {{building}} services, <b>metal</b> {{or plastic}} <b>hoses</b> {{are used to}} move water around a building; whilst air ducts are used to move air around (see air conditioning). They {{can also be used}} to take out vibration, and thermal or settlement movement.|$|R
40|$|The Short Straight Section (SSS) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may undergo {{relative}} displacements between cold-mass and cryostat for {{the following}} three reasons: - Fabrication tolerance of interconnection bellows - Global smoothing after pre-alignment - Ground motion in a sector of the LHC tunnel The forces responsible for such displacements stem from finite stiffness of interconnect bellows & <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> of the internal piping of the jumper connection and from relatively flexible 'glass fibre reinforced epoxy' (GFRE) composite supports of the cold mass. In addition, the vacuum jacket of the jumper connection and the large sleeves attached to both ends of SSS produce elastic deformations of the cryostat vessel. A unified finite element model consisting of cryostat, large sleeves, vacuum jacket of jumper, interconnection bellows, internal piping of jumper, composite cold supports and alignment jacks has been prepared. The knowledge {{of the position of}} the cold mass with respect to its cryostat under various conditions of alignment done using external fiducials mounted on the cryostat is essential.

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R
40|$|Eine Matrix-Isolationsanlage wurde konzipiert. Hauptteil war ein an fest installierte Spektrometer adaptierbares Dosiersystem zur Aufdampfung von Inertgasen (N 2,Ar) sowie binären Probandenschichten und Mischphasen auf Fenster(IR) und Reflektoren(FIR). Im untersuchten System Pyrrol-Aceton ist die N-H …O=C–Brücke realisiert. In ihr sind Effekte bei symmetrischer 3. 4. –Substitution des Donators zu erwarten. Neben Pyrrol selbst (Substituent: H-), erwiesen sich Dimethyl-, Dichlor- und Bis-Trifluormethylpyrrol als hinreichend stabil und oberflächenkompatibel im Dosiersystem, nicht jedoch 3. 4. - Dijodpyrrol. Die Ausbildung von Wasserstoffbrückenbindungen wurde beim Tempern binärer Schichten und ternärer Mischphasen quasi als partielles „Seelenleben der Moleküle“ registriert. Zielsetzung war die Gewinnung gesicherter Frequenzen, Kraftkonstanten und deren Änderungen als Folge der Heteroassoziation. Dabei konkurrierten offene, sowie zyklisch-strukturierte NH-Selbstassoziate. Dennoch wurde (auch in der Gasphase) ein schwächeres, offenbar elektrostatisch orientiertes Heteroassoziat I (linear) neben einem stärker bindenden Heteroassoziat II entdeckt: Die NH–Bindung in der N-H…O=C–Brücke zeigt auf Sauerstoff-Orbitale. Die Energie der Brücke wurde berechnet. Enge Korrelationen ergaben oft die modifizierten Hammett-Taftschen Konstanten und induktive ubstituentenparameter mit NH-Frequenzverschiebungen, Änderungen der Kraftkonstanten f N-H und der Brückenkraftkonstanten f H…O. Im Selbstassoziationsprozess des 3. 4. -Dichlorpyrrols der binären Matrix entwickelten sich zu- nehmend gegabelte NH… Cl-Brücken, die sich im Röntgenspektrum des Einkristalls dann als kooperativ und damit bestimmend für die Struktur erwiesen. An {{equipment}} {{for the purpose of}} matrix isolation of molecules imbedded in inert gases (N 2,Ar) was built-on. The main part was a dosing system, which was suitable for connections to fixed spectrometers. Within this system a vapour deposition of Hydrogen donators and acceptors on a window (IR) and a reflector (FIR) in well defined mixed phases could be realised. Behind measurements the temperatures on the window and reflector were able to be modified (that means: heating and freezing in close steps). Therefore different circumstances could be produced in transmission and reflection. There were used binary phase sandwich procedures but also the spray deposition of ternary phases. In the selected system pyrrol/acetone the N-H…. O=C–bridge is actualised. Different desired effects in hydrogen bonding can be expected depending on a symmetrical substitution within 3. 4. positions of the hydrogen donator. In addition of pyrrol (with H-as substituent) there were available 3. 4. dimethyl-, 3. 4. dichloro- and 3. 4. bistrifluoromethylpyrrol. These substances demonstrated a compatibility within the system, especially the glass tubes, <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> and the implemented dehydrogenation system, whereas 3. 4. diiodopyrrol failed because of the instability against heating and traces of oxygen. The formation of hydrogen bonds could be recorded during tempering the binary layers (using the sandwich technique) or the ternary phases: a translation of the hydrogen donator and acceptor started bidirectional and offered quasi a partial of the interacting molecules. The goals of this study were with high priority the data acquisition of significant frequencies and force constants and their variation depending on hydrogen bonding called hetero association. Thereby the N-H-self association detectable in a lot of cyclic and open chained structures competed against our demanded and expected structures. In spite of these phenomena two types of hydrogen bonds could be detected: there was a (predominant) electrostatic directed bridge (the linear hetero associate I) as well as a stronger bounded and angulated Hydrogen bridge, where the N-H–bond is directed towards the hybrid orbitals of the oxygen in acetone (hetero associate II). The energy of the bridge was calculated. On the one hand there was seen a close correlation between modified Hammett–Taft constants and inductive substituent effects on the other hand of experimentally gained differences of frequencies and force constants, the variation of the force constants f N-H and f O…H in the bridge herself. During the development of self association of the 3. 4. dichloropyrrol in binary matrices more and more bifurcated N-H…. 2 xCl–bridges could be detected. They determine finally the single crystal structure in x-ray analysis by cooperativeness...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> was {{technically}} a stripwound hose.

The hose was modelled after the goose throat necklace, a piece of jewellery that consisted of interlacing metal strips. The original design of the hose {{was based on a}} helically coiled metal strip with an S-shaped profile. The profile interlocked along the windings of the helical coil. Due to a cavity between the interlocking profiles, this did not create a tight fit. The cavity was sealed by means of a rubber thread.|$|E
