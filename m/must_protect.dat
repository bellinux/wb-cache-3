5|$|Secure Area: a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, {{in which the}} defenders <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> a room with biohazard containers, while the attackers must fight their way in.

5|$|At Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, whom {{he deems}} {{responsible}} for his father's death, and asserts that Peter is all the family he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she {{is in love with}} him. Peter, however, feels that he <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> her from the unwanted attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.|$|E

5|$|Edward and {{his family}} leave Forks because he {{believes}} he is endangering Bella's life. Bella goes into a depression until she develops a strong friendship with Jacob Black, who she discovers can shape-shift into a wolf. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> her from Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge {{the death of her}} mate James. Due to a misunderstanding, Edward believes Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in Volterra, Italy, but is stopped by Bella, who is accompanied by Edward's sister, Alice. They meet with the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven, and are released only on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and she and the Cullens return to Forks.|$|E
5|$|In Deathmatch, {{all players}} compete {{against each other}} and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must {{retrieve}} the flag from his enemy's base, and bring it to his own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found {{at the beginning of the}} team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until he may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which he can also shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E
5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.|$|E

40|$|A theological-ethical {{perspective}} on the protection of socio-economic rights In the human rights discourse the question is no longer asked whether human rights <b>must</b> be <b>protected</b> by a constitution, but rather which human rights <b>must</b> be <b>protected</b> by a constitution. The contemporary question is specifically pointed at the issue whether socio-economic rights <b>must</b> be <b>protected</b> by a con-stitution and to what extent. In this article socio-economic rights and their protection are evaluated from a theological-ethical perspective. This approach includes the investigation of certain Biblical themes and parts of Scripture from the Old and New Testament. The findings of this investigation indicate that socio-economic rights are very important human rights that should be protected as effectively as possible...|$|R

25|$|Featuring {{original}} story material by Brian Michael Bendis, Marvel Super Heroes includes multiple {{plots and}} includes characters from both Marvel and Disney properties.

The second storyline centers on Spider-Man and features him and his team tasked with the objective to stop Green Goblin's symbiote invasion. The third and final storyline concentrates around the Guardians of the Galaxy, in a plot heavily inspired by the Guardians of the Galaxy film, where the Guardians <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> Knowhere from Ronan the Accuser.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear <b>must</b> <b>protect</b> the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E
