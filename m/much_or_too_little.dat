5|$|High {{levels of}} {{humidity}} {{are essential for}} optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E

25|$|Uneven {{pigmentation}} of {{some sort}} affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or argyria, skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces either too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> melanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} of salt are the {{conditions}} associated with the consumption of either too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> salt. Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) and is used in food for both preservation and flavor. Sodium ions are needed in small quantities by most living things, as are chloride ions. Salt is involved in regulating the water content (fluid balance) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. Too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver.

25|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine {{per person per}} day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L {{per person per day}}, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> urine needs medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), oliguria when < 400 mL are produced, and anuria one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E
25|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element that {{is vital to the}} health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of organs and metabolic processes. The human body has complex homeostatic mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> nutritional ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.|$|E

25|$|A {{reason that}} our galaxy is {{considered}} rare by Rare Earth {{is because it}} appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances. The level of activity of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right. The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (1 Ma=1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.|$|E

500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, phimosis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E

500|$|Arnold {{wanted a}} theme song marrying the [...] "classic Bond sound" [...] with the electronica that would {{influence}} {{most of his}} score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them The World Is Not Enough {{would be seen as}} a generic action movie. Getting the balance right might be a [...] "poisoned chalice", since the results could sound too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> like a Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist Don Black on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to Tom Jones's [...] "Thunderball", Shirley Bassey's [...] "Diamonds Are Forever", Lulu's [...] "The Man with the Golden Gun" [...] and k.d. lang's closing credits theme, [...] "Surrender", from Tomorrow Never Dies.

According to Arnold, he [...] "strung some la-las together, {{and all of a sudden}} the [...] came to life". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the bridge (a contrasting section of about eight bars).|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{supports}} that male circumcision {{reduces the risk}} of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for {{men who have sex with}} men is less clear. Likewise, the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is also unclear. Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of those conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies of its potential protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been unclear. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> foreskin are the most common complications cited. Complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or in older children. Circumcision [...] does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.|$|E

50|$|Political {{feasibility}} {{analysis is}} used to predict the probable outcome of a proposed solution to a policy problem through examining the actors, events and environment involved in all stages of the policy-making process. It is one frequently used component of a policy analysis and can serve as an evaluative criterion in choosing between policy alternatives. Feasible policies must be politically acceptable {{or at least not}} unacceptable. Political unacceptability is a combination of two conditions <b>too</b> <b>much</b> opposition <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> support.

2500|$|Reeves and Nass {{explain that}} H. Paul Grice’s maxims for politeness {{are perhaps the}} most {{generally}} accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present {{just the right amount of}} information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.|$|E

2500|$|Puddling is {{the process}} of {{stirring}} pig iron with iron bars, exposing it to the air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. [...] This process creates steel. As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill. Because chemical testing of the molten iron had not yet been developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether too <b>much</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> carbon had been oxidized. Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to boil and bubble as the puddler stirred in scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.|$|E

With sacroiliitis, the individual may experience pain in the low back, buttock or thigh, depending {{on the amount of}} inflammation. Common problems of the sacroiliac joint are often called sacroiliac joint dysfunction (also termed SI joint dysfunction; SIJD). Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either <b>too</b> <b>much</b> motion <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> motion.

50|$|Certain {{ratios of}} these {{materials}} will provide beneficial bacteria with the nutrients {{to work at a}} rate that will heat up the pile. In that process much water will be released as vapor ("steam"), and the oxygen will be quickly depleted, explaining the need to actively manage the pile. The hotter the pile gets, the more often added air and water is necessary; the air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures (135°-160° Fahrenheit / 50° - 70° Celsius) until the materials are broken down. At the same time, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> air <b>or</b> water also slows the process, as does <b>too</b> <b>much</b> carbon (<b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> nitrogen).
