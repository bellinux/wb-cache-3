5|$|<b>Mid-air</b> {{collision}} - {{includes a}} list of other notable <b>mid-air</b> collisions.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in <b>mid-air</b> {{due to the}} rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backward.|$|E
5|$|List of {{accidents}} and incidents involving military aircraft (1950–1974) - lists eight U.S. military <b>mid-air</b> collisions in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed with birds dropping a leaf {{in the air and}} catching it in <b>mid-air</b> and these may possibly help young birds acquire aerobatic skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{stated that}} cockpit visibility limitations {{played a role}} in the accident, but also faulted military and civilian aviation authorities for not taking measures to reduce well known collision risks that had existed for over a year within the confines of airways, despite numerous complaints from airline crews. The loss of United Airlines Flight 736part of a series of 1950s <b>mid-air</b> collisions in American skies, including the well publicized 1956 Grand Canyon <b>mid-air</b> collisionhelped usher in widespread improvements in air traffic control within the United States.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts <b>mid-air,</b> such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel <b>mid-air,</b> the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Criteria for {{inclusion}} require at least 50 fatalities {{in a single}} occurrence involving commercial passenger and cargo flights, military passenger and cargo flights, or general aviation flights that {{have been involved in}} a ground or <b>mid-air</b> collision with either a commercial or military passenger or cargo flight.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in <b>mid-air</b> {{due to the}} rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Eleven species have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in <b>mid-air</b> collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in <b>mid-air</b> collisions during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|TB-3 and {{a single}} I-Z under the {{fuselage}} which attached and detached {{in the air as}} there was not enough ground clearance for the fighter. On 23 March 1935, TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy and I-Z with Stepanchenok at the controls performed the world's first <b>mid-air</b> docking between two fixed wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Hudson River <b>mid-air</b> {{collision}} was {{a flight}} accident that occurred on August8, 2009, at 11:53a.m. (15:53UTC). Nine people died when a tour helicopter {{and a small}} private airplane collided over the Hudson River near Frank Sinatra Park in Hoboken, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mid-air</b> {{collision}} involving United Airlines Flight 736, and {{a second}} one a month later over Maryland, between a Capital Airlines airliner and another military jet, accelerated efforts in the United States {{to change the way}} air space was allocated to commercial and military flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} began {{training with}} laser-guided bombs in October 1980. As of March 1984, its aircraft complement was nineteen Mirages. Two pilots died following a <b>mid-air</b> collision at low level on 9April that year.|$|E
5|$|A Drax Industries Moonraker {{space shuttle}} on loan to the United Kingdom is hijacked in <b>mid-air.</b> M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is {{attacked}} and {{pushed out of}} the plane by the mercenary assassin Jaws. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent.|$|E
5|$|After the World Championships, Tonelli {{accepted}} a swimming scholarship from the University of Alabama to train under John Gambril, having rejected offers from Stanford and Harvard. Tonelli was almost killed before ever swimming for the university, suffering a <b>mid-air</b> parachute malfunction during an activity with the campus skydiving club. Tonelli eventually completed a BA in Communications and Film.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{safety in}} Brazil {{had been under}} {{increased}} scrutiny following the <b>mid-air</b> collision in September 2006 over the Amazon of Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 and an Embraer Legacy 600 (see Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis). Congonhas was singled out for having safety issues relating to operations in wet weather due to its location and runway characteristics for the traffic it serves.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding <b>mid-air.</b> Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 1976, a Trident 3B on British Airways Flight 476 {{departed}} from London Heathrow to Istanbul. It collided in <b>mid-air</b> with an Inex Adria DC9-31 near Zagreb. All 54 passengers and 9 crew {{members on the}} BA aircraft died. This is the only fatal accident to a British Airways aircraft since the company's formation in 1974.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 2007, the Marine Corps {{announced}} the first V-22 combat deployment at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq. On 17 September 2007, 10 MV-22Bs of VMM-263 left for Iraq aboard USS Wasp. The {{decision to use}} a ship instead of self-deploying was made because of concerns over icing during the North Atlantic portion of the trip, lack of available KC-130s for <b>mid-air</b> refueling, and the Wasps availability.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1971, Hughes Airwest Flight 706, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 {{collided}} in <b>mid-air</b> with a United States Marine Corps F-4B Phantom {{above the}} San Gabriel Mountains, while {{en route from}} Los Angeles International Airport to Salt Lake City. All 49 on board the DC-9 {{and one of the}} crew on the F-4 were killed.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Oregon, Mulder and Skinner {{travel to}} the woods, {{equipped}} with lasers for finding the UFO. Noticing a spot where the lasers cease in <b>mid-air,</b> Mulder walks through the force field. He finds and joins a group of abductees, including Billy and Theresa, standing below a pillar of light from a UFO; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in <b>mid-air</b> to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in <b>mid-air</b> and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the {{television}} series Lost commenced airing in the United States and Canada on September 22, 2004, concluded on May 25, 2005, and contained 25 episodes. It introduces the 48 survivors of a plane that broke apart in <b>mid-air,</b> scattering them on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. Forced {{to work together to}} survive, they come to realize it is no ordinary island.|$|E
5|$|The more {{powerful}} hardware of the PlayStation 3 gave Team Ninja {{the opportunity to}} overhaul the game graphics to use larger and more detailed textures. Changes {{were made to the}} game world, with a few new areas and several additional save points and shops, and alterations to the game engine let players shoot arrows in <b>mid-air,</b> fight on water surfaces, and play as Rachel in some chapters and missions.|$|E
5|$|The next {{encounter}} pitted {{the team}} of Héctor Garza, Sonjay Dutt, and Sonny Siaki were pitted against {{the team of}} Kid Kash, Michael Shane, and Frankie Kazarian, who were accompanied by Traci, in a Six Man Tag Team match. Garza, Dutt, and Siaki won the match after Garza jumped off the top rope backwards and twisted in <b>mid-air</b> to perform a corkscrew moonsault onto Kazarian for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in <b>mid-air</b> and falling close to the ground before disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E
5|$|This article lists {{aircraft}} {{accidents and}} incidents which resulted in at least 50 fatalities in a single occurrence involving commercial passenger and cargo flights, military passenger and cargo flights, or general aviation flights that {{have been involved in}} a ground or <b>mid-air</b> collision with either a commercial or military passenger or cargo flight.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a <b>mid-air</b> collision, losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy. He ejected through the canopy, parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he could. He would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal <b>mid-air</b> collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, {{timed to}} explode in <b>mid-air,</b> were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a <b>mid-air</b> explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|Keč hijacked the {{aircraft}} with 122 passengers and {{a crew of}} six in <b>mid-air</b> after leaving Bardufoss. The aircraft landed as scheduled at Bodø, where all women, children and seniors were let off, along {{with two of the}} cabin crew. The aircraft then departed Bodø with 77 passengers and a crew of four. It was diverted to Gardermoen, where Keč made his demands. He surrendered at about 21:00, seven hours after take-off from Bardufoss, after some of his demands had been met. He was sentenced to four years prison for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Night falls, and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in <b>mid-air.</b> To prevent civilian casualties on the ground, Cloudbase is moved into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear on the radar, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist <b>mid-air</b> so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a <b>mid-air</b> move that targets and damages enemies in his path.|$|E
5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a <b>mid-air</b> collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|E
