40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) optical {{scanners}} with large-area {{mirrors and}} large angular rotation are {{of great interest}} for applications in display, printing, optical scanning and sensing, optical data storage, and free-space optical links between satellites. The Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology is very attractive to reduce the size, weight, {{and complexity of the}} optical scanners. Several bulk- [1, 2] and surface-micromachined [3, 4] 2 D scanners have been reported. To achieve large angular rotation for large-area micromirrors, the mirrors need to be suspended high above the substrate. This requires the use of complicated processing steps such as thick sacrificial materials or wafer bonding with bulk-micromachined structures. Previously, we reported a novel micromechanical structure called Micro-Elevator by Self-Assembly (MESA) [5] that can raise the surface-micromachined plates to several hundred micrometers above the wafer surface. In this paper, we report a novel 2 D scanner realized by the <b>MESA</b> <b>technology.</b> Large optical deflection angles (> k 14 ") have been achieved for large-area mirrors 400 x 400 pm 2 without employing thick sacrificial layers. The schematic structure of the MESA-based 2 D scanner is shown in Fig. 1. The micromirror is attached to a pair of suspended frames through two sets of orthogonal torsion beams. It can be rotated around two axes by applying electrostatic force between the mirror and the quadrant electrodes on the substrate. The outer frame is connected to four side-support plates by microhinges. By pushing the four microactuator plates inwards simultaneous, the cente...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the Optical Society of America {{and can be}} found at: [URL] conductive patterns created by photoexcitation of semiconductor substrates using digital light processing (DLP) provides a versatile approach for spatial and temporal modulation of THz waves. The reconfigurable nature of the technology has great potential in implementing several promising THz applications, such as THz beam steering, THz imaging or THz remote sensing, in a simple, cost-effective manner. In this paper, we provide physical insight about how the semiconducting materials, substrate dimension, optical illumination wavelength and illumination size impact the performance of THz modulation, including modulation depth, modulation speed and spatial resolution. The analysis establishes design guidelines for the development of photo-induced THz modulation technology. Evolved from the theoretical analysis, a new <b>mesa</b> array <b>technology</b> composed by a matrix of sub-THz wavelength structures is introduced to maximize both spatial resolution and modulation depth for THz modulation with low-power photoexcitation by prohibiting the lateral diffusion of photogenerated carriers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We report common-base medium power {{amplifiers}} designed for-band (140 – 220 GHz) and-band (75 – 110 GHz) in InP <b>mesa</b> double HBT <b>technology.</b> The common-base topology is preferred over common-emitter and common-collector topologies {{due to its}} superior high-frequency maximum stable gain (MSG). Base feed inductance and collector emitter overlap capacitance, however, reduce the common-base MSG. A single-sided collector contact reduces ce and, hence, improves the MSG. A single-stage common-base tuned amplifier exhibited 7 -dB small-signal gain at 176 GHz. This amplifier demonstrated 8. 7 -dBm output power with 5 -dB associated power gain at 172 GHz. A two-stage common-base amplifier exhibited 8. 1 -dBm output power with 6. 3 -dB associated power gain at 176 GHz and demonstrated 9. 1 -dBm saturated output power. Another two-stage common-base amplifier exhib-ited 11. 6 -dBm output power with an associated power gain of 4. 5 dB at 148 GHz. In the-band, different designs of single-stage common-base {{power amplifiers}} demonstrated saturated output power of 15. 1 dBm at 84 GHz and 13. 7 dBm at 93 GHz.
