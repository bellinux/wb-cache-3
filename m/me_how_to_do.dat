500|$|In 1994, Jean and Reiss {{signed a}} three-year deal with The Walt Disney Company to produce other {{television}} shows for ABC. The duo created and executive produced Teen Angel, which was canceled {{in its first}} season. Reiss said [...] "It was so compromised and overworked. I had 11 executives full-time telling <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my job." [...] The pair periodically returned to work on The Simpsons— for example, while under contract at Disney {{they were allowed to}} write and produce four episodes of the show, including season eight's [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" [...] (1997).|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} set out {{its case}} at the pre-trial committal hearing, which began in Minehead on 20 November 1978. At the request of Deakin's counsel, reporting restrictions were lifted, which meant that newspapers were free to print anything said in court without fear of the libel laws. This move infuriated Thorpe, who had hoped for an in camera hearing which would avoid unfortunate newspaper headlines and perhaps lead to the dismissal of the case. Whatever the outcome, Thorpe knew that the adverse publicity would destroy his career, and that Scott would thus have his revenge. As the hearings began, Bessell described the 1969 meetings where he alleged that Thorpe had suggested that Holmes should kill Scott, including the comment about the shooting of a sick dog. The court learned that Bessell had a contract with [...] The Sunday Telegraph, which was paying him £50,000 for his story. Dinshaw gave evidence of the £20,000 he had received from Hayward and passed to Holmes, and of subsequent attempts by Thorpe to obscure the details of these transactions. Newton testified that Holmes had wanted Scott killed: [...] "He would prefer it if [...] vanished {{from the face of}} the earth and was never seen again. It was left to <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it". Scott gave clinical details of his alleged seduction by Thorpe at Thorpe's mother's house in November 1961 and on other occasions, and also recounted his ordeal on the moors above Porlock Hill. At the end of the hearing the presiding magistrate committed the four defendants for trial at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had several}} visits of the like kind from him, {{but he never}} came into a settled way of maintenance, which was what I would have best pleased with. Once, indeed, he asked <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I <b>did</b> <b>to</b> live. I {{answered}} him pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I took with him, but that indeed I worked at my needle, and could just maintain myself; that sometime it was as much as I was able <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and I shifted hard enough.|$|R

She was taught to draw by her Romanian governess and became obsessed with drawing with {{expression}} {{because it was not}} as confining or labeling as oral language. Living in Germany after the end of World War II greatly affected the liking she took to drawing. [...] "We could not speak German. Germans were hated. We had to learn French and English. We were always traveling somewhere else, speaking something else. But I had a Romanian governess who taught <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> draw.

40|$|Contra fiddlers don’t {{talk about}} {{practicing}} a whole lot, {{and when they}} do, it’s often with frustration and regret. The premise of this project is that talking, sharing strategies, and sharing experiences can transform practice from an overwhelming and isolating activity to a satisfying and social one. While this document serves only as a study, the interviews {{that gave birth to}} this analysis were conversational and often musical. I hope that fiddling visits of this type will continue, not just for me, but for any curious practicers seeking advice. Sometimes looking at really good fiddlers, you wonder. Why does music seem so much easier for some people? Did they ever have a hard time with anything? Why can’t I play like that? Why doesn’t anybody tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> just <b>do</b> it? The answers to these questions are not short and simple, nor are they readily available. Many contra dance fiddlers come from musical families, musical childhoods, and other musical environments like jazz bands and school orchestras, but these experiences alone do not guarantee a successful fiddling experience. Neither does a “natural touch ” or a “good ear ” without proper application...|$|R
