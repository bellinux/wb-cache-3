40|$|Abstract. Imperfect {{representation}} of vertical mixing {{near the surface}} in atmospheric transport models leads to uncertainties in modelled tracer mixing ratios. When using the atmosphere as an integrator to derive surface-atmosphere exchange from mixing ratio observations made in the atmospheric boundary layer, this uncertainty has to be quantified and taken into account. A comparison between radiosondederived <b>mixing</b> <b>heights</b> and <b>mixing</b> <b>heights</b> derived from ECMWF meteorological data during May–June 2005 in Europe revealed random discrepancies of about 40 % for the daytime with insignificant bias errors, and much larger values approaching 100 % for nocturnal mixing layers with bias errors also exceeding 50 %. The Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model was used to propagate this uncertainty into CO 2 mixing ratio uncertainties, accounting for spatial and temporal error covariance. Average values of 3 ppm were found for the 2 month period, indicating that this represents a large fraction of the overall uncertainty. A pseudo data experiment shows that the error propagation with STILT avoids biases in flux retrievals when applied in inversions. The results indicate that flux inversions employing transport models based on current generation meteorological products have misrepresented {{an important part of}} the model error structure likely leading to biases in the estimated mean and uncertainties. We strongly recommend including the solution presented in this work: better, higher resolution atmospheric models, a proper description of correlated random errors, and a modification of the overall sampling strategy...|$|R

In many applications, e. g. the comparison of model output with observations the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> is taken from radiosoundings.

Since the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> is strongly varying both in time and space an observation along a single line like a radiosonde track represents only an estimate of the <b>mixing</b> <b>height.</b> Quasi-continuous measurements of the backscatter signal with a ground-based lidar from several field campains offer the opportunity to estimate the error associated with a mixing-height determination from radiosoundings. A method to determine the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> from the backscattered signal is presented. Data from several field campaigns are used, namely the Nauru 99 campaign in the tropical western Pacific in June/July 1999, three campaigns at the ARM-site in Oklahoma (USA) in September/October 1999, September/October 2000 and November/December 2000 and three campaigns in the frame of the German EVA-GRIPS (Regional Evaporation at Grid/Pixel Scale) project near Lindenberg (Brandenburg, Germany) in September 2002, April 2003 and May/June 2003 (LITFASS- 2003).

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the depth of daytime and nighttime mixing layers must be known very accurately to relate boundary-layer concentrations of gases or particles to upstream fluxes. The mixing-height is parametrized in numerical weather prediction models, so improving the {{determination of}} the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> will improve the quality of the estimated gas and particle budgets. Datasets of mixing-height diurnal cycles with high temporal and spatial resolutions are sought by various end users. Lidars and ceilometers provide vertical profiles of backscatter from aerosol particles. As aerosols are predominantly concentrated in the mixing layer, lidar backscatter profiles can be used to trace the depth of the mixing layer. Large numbers of automatic profiling lidars and ceilometers are deployed by meteorological services and other agencies in several European countries providing systems to monitor the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> on temporal and spatial scales of unprecedented density. We investigate limitations and capabilities of existing <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> retrieval algorithms by applying five different retrieval techniques to three different lidars and ceilometers deployed during two 1 -month campaigns. We studied three important steps in the <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> retrieval process, namely the lidar/ceilometer pre-processing to reach sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, gradient detection techniques to find the significant aerosol gradients, and finally quality control and layer attribution to identify the actual <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> from multiple possible layer detections. We found that layer attribution {{is by far the most}} uncertain step. We tested different gradient detection techniques, and found no evidence that the first derivative, wavelet transform, and two-dimensional derivative techniques have different skills to detect one or multiple significant aerosol gradients from lidar and ceilometer attenuated backscatter. However, our study shows that, when <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> retrievals from a ultraviolet lidar and a near-infrared ceilometer agreed, they were 25 - 40 % more likely to agree with an independent radiosonde <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> retrieval than when each lidar or ceilometer was used alone.

It is a worthwhile effort to pursue such studies so that within a few years automatic profiling lidar and ceilometer networks can be utilized efficiently to monitor mixing heights at the European scale. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Inthis study, the UAM {{has been applied to}} investigate he sensitivity of ozone predictions to the choices in wind fields and <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> profiles for the data-sparse New York metropolitan area. A set of three wind fields, in combination with spatially varying and spatially invafiant mixing heights, isinvesti-gated for the July 1988 ozone episode. In general, mndei-predicted ozone levels were higher under the spatially varying <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> (SVM) option than under the spatially invariant <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> (SIM) option. SVM-based UAM simulations provided better agreement between the predicted and measured ozone concentrations than SIM-based UAM simulations. However, from the regulatory standpoint, predicted ozone concentrations based on either of these <b>mixing</b> <b>height</b> options are within the range considered as acceptable. UAM simulations with emission reductions of 75 % NOx and 25 % VOCs (NOx-focnsed) reveal that the improvement i peak ozone levels under the SIM option is larger than that under the SVM option, whereas the emission reduction scenario f 25 % NOx and 75 % VOCs (VOC-focused) yields greater improvement i peak ozone under the SVM option than with the SIM option. Given the strong influence of mixing heights and wind fields on UAM mode] predictions indata-sparse areas, it i...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{profiles}} of meteorological parameters obtained from balloon-borne GPS Radiosonde {{for a period}} of more than two years are analyzed for characterization of the coastal atmospheric boundary layer (CABL) over Thumba (8. 5 ∘N, 76. 9 ∘E, India). The study reports seasonal variability in the thickness of three different sublayers of the CABL, namely, mixed layer, turbulent flow, and sea breeze flow. Among the three, the vertical thickness of sea breeze flow showed considerable dominance on the other two throughout the year. <b>Mixed</b> layer <b>heights</b> derived through gradients in virtual potential temperature () showed large seasonal variability with a peak in the Summer and Post-Monsoon. On the other hand, the vertical thickness of turbulent flow remained steady all through the year. Results from the present study indicate that the magnitudes of <b>mixed</b> layer <b>heights</b> are often larger than the turbulent flow thickness...|$|R
40|$|Measurements at {{the central}} {{facility}} of the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) are intended to verify, improve, and develop parameterizations in radiative flux models that are subsequently used in General Circulation Models (GCMs). The reliability of this approach depends upon the representativeness of the local measurements {{at the central}} facility for the site as a whole or on how these measurements can be interpreted so as to accurately represent increasingly large scales. The variation of surface energy budget terms over the SGP CART site is extremely large. Surface layer measurements of the sensible heat flux (H) often vary {{by a factor of}} 2 or more at the CART site (Coulter et al. 1996). The Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) effectively integrates the local inputs across large scales; because the <b>mixed</b> layer <b>height</b> (h) is principally driven by H, it can, in principal, be used for estimates of surface heat flux over scales on the order of tens of kilometers. By combining measurements of h from radiosondes or radar wind profiles with a one-dimensional model of <b>mixed</b> layer <b>height,</b> they are investigating the ability of diagnosing large-scale heat fluxes. The authors have developed a procedure using the model described by Boers et al. (1984) to investigate the effect of changes in surface sensible heat flux on the <b>mixed</b> layer <b>height.</b> The objective of the study is to invert the sense of the model...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{were made}} from a ship at 17. 5 [*]°N & 89 [*]°E in the North Bay of Bengal during July-August 1999. The Bay was {{convective}}ly active during this period with almost one convective event every week. The surface wind speed varied from 3 to 15 m s− 1. SST decreased by 0. 5 ° to 1 [*]°C following convection. The latent heat flux was about 25 – 35 % lower over the Bay compared to that over the West Pacific at comparable wind speeds. High resolution radiosonde observations have been made {{for the first time}} in the North Bay. The values of atmospheric <b>mixed</b> layer <b>height,</b> equivalent potential temperature, convective available potential energy and convection inhibition energy over the North Bay are comparable to those observed over the western Pacific warm pool region. The recovery timescale of the atmospheric variables such as <b>mixed</b> layer <b>height,</b> equivalent potential temperature and convective available potential energy is one to two days. © 2001 American Geophysical Unio...|$|R
