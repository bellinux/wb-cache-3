40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) One of {{the most}} promising proposals for an Advanced Frontlighting System (AFS) is <b>bending</b> <b>light,</b> in which light from headlamps is directed into the path of a turn. We performed a field study to investigate the appearance of <b>bending</b> <b>light,</b> implemented as a swiveling beam pattern, to other roadway users. Observers were asked to view a series of turning maneuvers performed by a vehicle equipped with <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> and were asked to comment on the maneuvers in three sets of trials. The three sets were structured to direct progressively more of the observer’s attention to the vehicle’s frontlighting system. Responses were classified to indicate the degree to which observers spontaneously noticed specific details about the frontlighting system. In another series of trials, observers viewed turning maneuvers in which the bending-light function was inactive on half of the trials, and were asked to distinguish whether it was active or inactive. Results suggest that observers are not very sensitive to the movement of <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> and often report lamp movement as variation in the intensity of the lamp; that is, the lamp appears to brighten and dim. Although the appearance of variation in brightness {{could be used as a}} signature for <b>bending</b> <b>light,</b> observers demonstrate a limited ability to distinguish <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> from fixed light. Overall, the results suggest that the likelihood that beam movement would either help or hinder other road users is small...|$|R
5000|$|The {{illusion}} {{is caused}} by a gravitational lens, in space between the object and the observer's telescope, which <b>bends</b> <b>light</b> as it travels. The effect is analogous to the atmospheric mirage, which has been observed since antiquity, in circumstances where the air temperature varies strongly with height over the ground or sea; the rapidly changing refractive index <b>bends</b> <b>light,</b> producing inverted and/or multiple images [...] "floating" [...] in the air.|$|R
40|$|Non-static {{gravitational}} fields generally introduce frequency shifts when <b>bending</b> <b>light.</b> In this paper, I {{discuss the}} frequency shifts induced in the <b>bending</b> of <b>light</b> by moving masses.

40|$|The <b>bending</b> of <b>light</b> in Kottler space (the Schwarzschild vacuum with cosmological {{constant}}) is examined. It {{is shown}} that the cosmological constant cancels out of the classical <b>light</b> <b>bending</b> formula.

40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is study weak {{gravitational}} lensing of quantum (perturbed) (QLBHL) and classical (CLBHL) Lukewarm black hole in presence of cosmological parameter Λ. We apply numerical method to evaluate deflection angle of <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> rays, images locations θ of sample source β=-π/ 4, and corresponding magnifications μ. There is not obtained real values for Einstein rings locations θ_E(β= 0) for CLBHL but we calculate them for QLBHL. As experimental test of our calculations, we choose mass M of 60 type of most massive observed galactic black holes as gravitational lens and study quantum matter fields effects on the angle of <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> rays in presence of the cosmological constant effects. We calculate locations of non-relativistic images and corresponding magnifications. Numerical diagrams show that the quantum matter effects cause to be reduce absolute values of the quantum deflection angle {{with respect to the}} classical ones. Sign of the quantum deflection angle is changed with respect to the classical values in presence of the cosmological constant. This means dominance of anti-gravity counterpart of the cosmological horizon on the <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> rays angle with respect to absorbing effects of local 60 type of observed most massive black holes. Variations of the image positions and magnifications are negligible by increasing dimensionless cosmological constant ϵ= 16 Λ M^ 2 / 3. Deflection angle takes positive (negative) values for CLBHL (QLBHL) and they decrease very fast (slow) by increasing closest distance x_ 0 of <b>bending</b> <b>light</b> ray and/or dimensionless cosmological parameter for sample giant black holes 0. 001 <ϵ< 0. 01.

50|$|Albert Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, the theory predicted that large masses such as stars would <b>bend</b> <b>light,</b> in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.|$|R
5000|$|According to some accounts, {{unspecified}} [...] "researchers" [...] {{thought that}} {{some version of}} this field would enable using large electrical generators to <b>bend</b> <b>light</b> around an object via refraction, so that the object became completely invisible.

50|$|Inside the base, Swedish {{engineers}} led by Astrid Lundgren {{are working}} on a laser defence system involving a force field that <b>bends</b> <b>light</b> rays.

50|$|Huchra's lens is the lensing {{galaxy of}} the Einstein Cross (Quasar 2237+30); {{it is also}} called ZW 2237+030 or QSO 2237+0305 G. It {{exhibits}} the phenomenon of gravitational lensing that was postulated by Albert Einstein {{when he realized that}} gravity would be able to <b>bend</b> <b>light</b> and thus could have lens-like effects. The galaxy is named for astronomer John Huchra.|$|R
50|$|Phase {{contrast}} {{takes advantage}} of the fact that different structures have different refractive indices, and so <b>bend</b> <b>light</b> and delay its passage through the sample by different amounts. The retardation of the light results in some waves being 'out of phase' with others, and so to the human eye a microscope in phase contrast mode effectively darkens or brightens particular areas to reflect this change.|$|R
50|$|Visitors can {{experience}} {{the characteristics of}} light and optics by playing the stringless Laser harp, breaking white light into the spectrum of colors it's made of, or catching your shadow on the wall. Visitors can also watch how refraction <b>bends</b> <b>light</b> and distorts images, see how objects look different under light emitted by different materials, and observe how polarization|polarizing light can change its brightness and color.|$|R
5000|$|The values {{indicated}} in the sphere and cylinder columns of an eyeglass prescription specify the optical power of the lenses in diopters, abbreviated D. The higher the number of diopters, the more the lens refracts or <b>bends</b> <b>light.</b> A diopter is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. If a lens has a focal length of [...] meters, it is a 3 diopter lens.|$|R

The <b>bending</b> angle of <b>light</b> by the electric field of charged black hole is computed from geometric optics and a general formula is derived for <b>light</b> <b>bending</b> valid for any orientation of the magnetic dipole. The astronomical significance of the <b>light</b> <b>bending</b> by magnetic field of a neutron star is discussed.

50|$|This method uses {{a similar}} {{principle}} to how a prism works to separate white light into its component colors. A gemological spectroscope is employed {{to analyze the}} selective absorption {{of light in the}} gem material. Essentially, when light passes from one medium to another, it <b>bends.</b> Blue <b>light</b> <b>bends</b> more than red light. How much the <b>light</b> <b>bends</b> will vary depending on the gem material. Coloring agents or chromophores show bands in the spectroscope and indicate which element is responsible for the gem's color.|$|R

40|$|Using {{the fact}} that {{effective}} wireless range decraise in inverse function of local traffic density, we show that a variable traffic density impacts the curvature of paths in a dense wireless ad hoc network {{the same way a}} variable optical density <b>bends</b> <b>light</b> paths. We set up the general laws that paths must satisfy in presence of traffic flow density. We quantify the effect and we give some example of configurations treated analytically...|$|R

She can project beams of light powerful enough to pulverize boulders or focus them to create laser beams that can instantly cut through objects. She can <b>bend</b> <b>light</b> around her and other objects in order to make them invisible. Although she joins Rory on his superhero jaunts, during which she uses the codename Imp, she is not as obsessed with being a superhero as Rory is.|$|R
5000|$|Energy {{also has}} mass {{according}} {{to the principle of}} mass-energy equivalence. This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including pair production, nuclear fusion, and the gravitational <b>bending</b> of <b>light.</b> Pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy, or vice versa. In the gravitational <b>bending</b> of <b>light,</b> photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass.|$|R

We look here at the impact that metamaterials are having on photonics...|$|R
50|$|Gravitational lensing is {{an effect}} of Einstein's general relativity, which says that all matter <b>bends</b> <b>light</b> that passes by it. Strong {{gravitational}} lensing drastically alters {{the shape of an}} object on the sky; weak gravitational lensing slightly alters the shape of the object; and gravitational microlensing alters only the brightness of the object, instead of its shape. Gravitational lensing in general, and especially microlensing, has had a vast impact on astronomy, specifically in the search for extrasolar planets.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} in a refracting telescope refracts or <b>bends</b> <b>light.</b> This refraction causes parallel light rays to converge at a focal point; while those not parallel converge upon a focal plane. The telescope converts {{a bundle of}} parallel rays to make an angle α, with the optical axis to a second parallel bundle with angle β. The ratio β/α is called the angular magnification. It equals the ratio between the retinal image sizes obtained with and without the telescope.|$|R
