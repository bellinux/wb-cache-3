5000|$|The Green Pumphouse forms {{part of the}} [...] "Dörfchen" [...] (petit hameau) and is {{situated}} in the park on the southern canal where a marked drop in altitude to the central area of the park allowed the installation of water wheels (...) [...] It was built in 1720 by Joseph Effner for Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and contained pumps to supply water to the nearby Badenburg. In 1762, it was renewed and further little houses were added containing a forge and dwellings for the pump attendant and other servants. In 1767, Francois Poitevin installed a wooden baroque pumping station pumping water to water towers from where the fountain in the Large Parterre was <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity.</b>|$|R
50|$|The loaded slate trains {{continued}} to <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> {{until the end}} of passenger services in 1939. Slate trains eventually became very long - trains of less than eighty slate wagons carried two brakesmen but over eighty wagons (and this became common) required three brakesmen. About one wagon in every six was equipped with a brake, the others being unbraked. Trains {{continued to}} pass at Tan-y-Bwlch and, to a lesser extent, at Minffordd. The Summer timetable for 1900 had nine trains daily in each direction and trains had been accelerated to one hour from Porthmadog to Duffws including stops at Minffordd, Penrhyn, Tan-y-Bwlch, Dduallt (request), Tanygrisiau, Blaenau (LNWR) and Blaenau (GWR). Speeds in excess of 40 mph were then normal.|$|R
5000|$|The quarry was on {{the north}} spur of Mount Waldo, 660 ft above sea level, one-third mile {{southwest}} {{of the town of}} Frankfort. The operator of the quarry was the Mount Waldo Granite Works of Frankfort. Granite from the quarry was reportedly a medium gray color. Transport of the granite was by two graded tracks, each 1200 ft long, <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> from the quarry part way down the hill to the power house, thence by a cable road (Roebling engine) 1¼ miles to the wharf, which is accessible to schooners at 15 ft draft.

50|$|The {{remaining}} impurities {{are trapped}} and eliminated in the soil, with the excess water eliminated through percolation into the soil, through evaporation, and by uptake through the root system {{of plants and}} eventual transpiration or entering groundwater or surface water. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see weeping tile), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the drain field {{is proportional to the}} volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift pump. Certain septic tank designs include siphons or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the drainage field. These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or bioclogging.|$|R
50|$|Up to {{the mid-1980s}} the railway <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> alone: Both cars had a water tank under their decks {{and the one}} at the upper station was filled with water while {{the one at the}} lower station (Territet) was dumping its {{contents}} in Lake Geneva (Lac Leman). Once the fill-dump process and passenger boarding were complete the brakes were gradually released and since both cars were attached by a single cable passing over a pulley arrangement at Glion, the heavier car descended the slope carrying up the lighter car. The process was then repeated so the car uphill was always filled and the one downhill always empty and thus pulled uphill when brakes were released. An added picturesque note was that the two car operators were communicating for synchronisation with whistles instead of an intercom or similar device. Eventually the system was abandoned and the train now uses electric traction.|$|R
5000|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, under Title III, {{and many}} {{state and local}} governments {{regulate}} locksets in buildings occupied by the public. Typically, locksets that employ door knob controlled latches are forbidden for public use in favor of lever handles, which are easier to <b>operate</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> instead of the grasping and turning required by knobs. Many municipalities also regulate locksets in terms of fire rating, using standards determined more broadly by national or international organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories in the United States or the International Code Council, which are often supplemented by local governmental organizations, e.g. New York City's Materials and Equipment Acceptance (MEA) Division of their Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA), or by local building codes. For example, mandates of building code may outlaw, e.g., E2141/F16 [...] "Double-Keyed Deadbolt" [...] from group occupancies, or require, e.g., F93/F15 on hotel or motel doors.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{system is a}} tiled leach field combined with a septic tank. The basic idea {{is to provide a}} small system with primary sewage treatment.

Septic tanks can <b>operate</b> entirely <b>by</b> <b>gravity,</b> and if well managed, are reasonably safe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of bare rock ledges and proximity to tidewater made this granite amenable to quarrying {{in the early}} 19th century. The two significant quarries in the Mount Waldo Granite in the 19th century were on the northeast flank of Mount Waldo itself, and {{near the top of}} Mosquito Mountain. According to a description of the operations from the early 20th century, the quarried stone was taken over graded tracks, <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity,</b> to cutting sheds and wharfs on Marsh River.

50|$|Coalmont Collieries {{took over}} the {{operation}} in 1913, and began mining higher on the mountain, accessing the coal from above, but production and all development in the town stopped when War broke out in 1914. After the War, owners Blake Wilson and Pat Burns reorganized the company, and resumed operations. When the three mile long Aerial Tramway was built to carry the coal from the Blakeburn minesite down to Coalmont, production increased from about 10,000 tons a year to over 100,000 and it eventually peaked at 167,461 tons in 1928. The Tramway <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity,</b> the full hoppers of coal moving down providing the energy to take the empty buckets back up, and it could transport a ton of coal a minute. The Kettle Valley Railway, part of the C.P.R., originally purchased the coal for their steam engines, but quickly discovered that it burned too hot and warped the firebox grates, a similar problem to that experienced by the locals when used in their stoves. Stove lids and grates were big sellers in the local stores! The old KVR railbed (sans rails) {{is now part of}} the well maintained Trans Canada Trail.|$|R

40|$|In the Ahuachapán Geothermal Field the {{reinjection}} pipeline used {{to connect}} the flasher unit with the injection zone in Chipilapa has a total length of 6. 02 km. The main flow is carried by a 24 ” pipe diameter of 4647 length until the Ch- 7 bis pad where it is distributed into the injector wells Ch- 7, Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9. Because the pipeline is <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> “open channel ” the flow capacity {{is limited to the}} elevation between the flasher and any of the injector wells (dh). In this way using the wells Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9 a dh of 18. 75 m give a maximum flow of 326 kg/s and if a residual water of 345 kg/s is operated 19 kg/s must be spilled into the waste channel. The use of the wells Ch- 7 and Ch- 9 decrease the dh to 11. 7 m given a maximum flow of 239 kg/s rising the spilling water to 106 kg/s. To overcome this problem the pipeline must be operated as “filled pipe ” by pressure gradient.

5000|$|Cogenhoe was {{involved}} in the extractive industries. Digging for iron ore began at Cogenhoe in the late 1850s with opencast quarrying and mines - the latter of which, according to local lore, collapsed one lunchtime while the men were away having their midday meals. The mines were for whatever reason opened out in about 1868. The quarries continued up the hill towards the Firs. These quarries were connected to the main London and North Western Railway in the valley by way of narrow gauge and standard gauge private branch-lines. The narrow gauge line was cable worked taking the ore down to a tipping dock on the standard gauge branch. [...] In about 1870, the operation moved west with a standard gauge line running through what is now the Pocket Park to the Ironstone field south of the Playing Fields. A short narrow gauge branch always worked by hand or horses connected that quarry to the standard gauge branch. The standard gauge line was originally <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> and horses, the loaded wagons coasting down the gradient from the western end of the line to just south of the road near Roe Farm. However steam locomotives were intoduced in 1880 or shortly afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Like all {{fountain}}s of the time, {{the fountain}} on St. Peter's Square had no pumps and <b>operated</b> purely <b>by</b> <b>gravity,</b> with {{a source of}} water higher than the fountain which caused the water to shoot upwards. The source of water for the fountain, the Aqua Paola, was on the Janiculum hill, 266 above sea level, which meant that the fountain could shoot water twenty feet upwards into the air. In 1641, the Flemish lawyer Theodor Ameyden said that the jet {{of water from the}} top of the fountain [...] "seemed to rise in the air like a veritable river."

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} to develop affordable, energy-saving, and highly-effective technologies {{to alleviate the}} current water crisis. In this work, we reported a low-cost electrochemical filtration device composing of a conductive cotton filter anode and a Ti foil cathode. The device was <b>operated</b> <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> feed. The conductive cotton filter anodes were fabricated by a facile dying method to incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as fillers. The CNTs could serve as adsorbents for pollutants adsorption, as electrocatalysts for pollutants electrooxidation, and as conductive additives to render the cotton filters highly conductive. Cellulose-based cotton could serve as low-cost support to ‘host’ these CNTs. Upon application of external potential, the developed filtration device could not only achieve physically adsorption of organic compounds, but also chemically oxide these compounds on site. Three model organic compounds were employed to evaluate the oxidative capability of the device, i. e., ferrocyanide (a model single-electron-transfer electron donor), methyl orange (MO, a common recalcitrant azo-dye found in aqueous environments), and antibiotic tetracycline (TC, a common antibiotic released from the wastewater treatment plants). The devices exhibited a maximum electrooxidation flux of 0. 37 mol/h/m 2 for 5. 0 mmol/L ferrocyanide, of 0. 26 mol/h/m 2 for 0. 06 mmol/L MO, and of 0. 9 mol/h/m 2 for 0. 2 mmol/L TC under given experimental conditions. The effects of several key operational parameters (e. g., total cell potential, CNT amount, and compound concentration) on the device performance were also studied.

40|$|Generation II Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) have {{a design}} {{weakness}} {{as shown by}} the Fukushima accident. Therefore, Generation III+ NPPs are developed with focus on improvements of fuel technology and thermal efficiency, standardized design, and the use of passive safety system. One type of Generation III+ NPP is the AP 1000 that is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) type that has received the final design acceptance from US-NRC and is already under construction at several sites in China as of 2015. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the behavior and performance of the passive safety system in the AP 1000 and to verify the safety margin during the direct vessel injection (DVI) line break as selected event. This event was simulated using RELAP 5 /SCDAP/Mod 3. 4 as a best-estimate code developed for transient simulation of light water reactors during postulated accidents. This event is also described in the AP 1000 design control document as one of several postulated accidents simulated using the NOTRUMP code. The results obtained from RELAP 5 calculation was then compared with the results of simulations using the NOTRUMP code. The results show relatively good agreements in terms of time sequences and characteristics of some injected flow from the passive safety system. The simulation results show that the break of one of the two available DVI lines can be mitigated by the injected coolant flowing, which is <b>operated</b> effectively <b>by</b> <b>gravity</b> and density difference in the cooling system and does not lead to core uncovery. Despite the substantial effort to obtain an apropriate AP 1000 model due to lack of detailed geometrical data, the present model can be used as a platform model for other initiating event considered in the AP 1000 accident analysis.
