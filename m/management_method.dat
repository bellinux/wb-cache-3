Given that companies have started to deploy a number of knowledge <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> in support of NPD efforts, the central aim {{of this research is}} to investigate how ten such methods support knowledge creation during the development of new products. We provide evidence from a survey of 356 responses of members of 94 NPD projects on the utilization of (and satisfaction with) 14 knowledge <b>management</b> <b>methods.</b> The 10 highest rated knowledge <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> (in terms of satisfaction) are discussed in more detail, explaining how they operate to support knowledge creation in NPD projects, and illustrated with examples from companies such as ABB, Siemens, BP Amoco, Volkswagen, IBM, HP, and others.

40|$|Innovation <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been}} subject to {{extensive}} research during the last decades, many of which have found their way to application in practice. However, innovation <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> are still predominantly used within company boundaries, although knowledge contributions of external business partners could often boost the benefits of applying these methods. Smart Networks, focusing on Organizational Networking, Knowledge Networking and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Networking, offer an approach for the collaborative, inter-enterprise implementation of such methods. This paper presents an engineering approach for how innovation <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> can be applied collaboratively within this specific form of enterprise networking. An approach to implement innovation <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> with help of ICT applications is highlighted. Exemplarily, an implementation of the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is illustrated...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the design {{approach}} had evolved yet again. One {{problem with the}} [...] "second generation" [...] design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to [...] "roll forward" [...] and test {{the impact of these}} goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement. This device was a statement of what [...] "strategic success", or the [...] "strategic end-state", looked like. It was quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created {{at the beginning of the}} design process, then it was easier to select strategic activity and outcome objectives to respond to it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the results-based <b>management</b> <b>method</b> proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before, and have been proposed as representing a [...] "third generation" [...] design method for balanced scorecards.|$|E
2500|$|Configuration Management {{originated}} in the United States Department of Defense in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and {{it is now a}} standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of military standards called the [...] "480 series" [...] (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the [...] "480 series" [...] was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry technical standards supported by standards developing organizations (SDO). This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, ANSI–EIA–649–1998. Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include systems engineering (SE), integrated logistics support (ILS), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 9000, Prince2 project <b>management</b> <b>method,</b> COBIT, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), product lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management. [...] Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.|$|E

Although, the number of existing information security risk <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> is enormous, in practice a lot of time, effort and knowledge are invested by organizations in the process of creating new information security risk <b>management</b> <b>methods.</b> Surprisingly, the study of literature reveals a lack of sufficient research concerning the process of developing new, or improving existing, information security risk <b>management</b> <b>methods.</b> Therefore, in this paper we operate within the paradigm of design science research in order to propose a systematic process for the development of new, or improvement of existing, information security risk <b>management</b> <b>methods.</b> Furthermore, this effort emphasizes the effective utilization of pre-existing and new knowledge on information security risk management created throughout the process. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

The authors aimed to analyze and assess the scope of familiarity with basic project <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> and their application within the implementation of EU projects in the Czech Republic in the Programming Period 2007 – 2013. Based on a questionnaire survey of EU project organisers, the authors evaluate their attitudes to project <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> as effectiveness improvement tools. The analysis also considers the degree of dependence between familiarity with project <b>management</b> <b>methods,</b> their application, and their effectiveness as perceived by EU project organisers. Finally, it presents recommendations to the institutional authorities and project organisers with respect to applications during the Programming Period 2014 – 2020.

40|$|ABSTRACTAn {{empirical}} {{contribution to}} the generation of planning and management methodsIn the field of management knowledge, it is no simple task to find a discussion on how to systematize an academic research study {{for the creation of}} <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> (frameworks). How to plan an exploratory, qualitative and interdisciplinary research study for the generation of planning and <b>management</b> <b>methods</b> is the focus of this paper. Desk research, documental analysis, grounded theory, and case studies are the methods that might be employed by most studies that produce sequences of planning and managerial steps, despite the importance of many other qualitative research methods. The empirical contribution of this work starts with the presentation of different planning and <b>management</b> <b>methods,</b> recently approved in academic journals and conferences, and built under a common method (process) of thought. This is followed not only by a discussion of how to structure scientific research for the generation of planning and <b>management</b> <b>methods,</b> but also by a presentation of the process for publication (and recognition) of this line of research...|$|R
