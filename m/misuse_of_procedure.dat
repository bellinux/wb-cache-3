40|$|Studying {{the health}} {{maintenance}} {{attitudes and behaviors}} of physicians (MDs) as patients provides information about health maintenance care {{in a group of}} individuals where preventive care might flourish. The present study reports the results of a survey of such attitudes and behaviors among 144 university-based MDs and 283 nonphysician doctoral faculty members (non-MDs) from two area universities regarding their personal health maintenance care in 1983. Respondents who reported having a personal MD (44 % MDs, 74 % non-MDs) were twice as likely to believe they should visit a physician regularly for health maintenance and three times as likely to actually visit a physician for health maintenance as those respondents without a personal physician. Both MDs and non-MDs described the need to visit the doctor more often than they actually reported doing so for health maintenance. However, MDs more often than non-MDs reported receiving the particular health maintenance procedures that are generally considered to constitute essential health maintenance care. A better understanding of health maintenance care by MDs and their non-MD colleagues provides insights into the use and <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>procedures</b> in the asymptomatic adult...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of harmonizing Serbian legislation with the EU law, however still neglected in Serbia, is the mutual relationship between the design and coordination of public policies on the one hand, and the harmonization of legislation in the course of negotiations for EU accession, on the other hand. This aspect has been largely neglected because <b>of</b> the <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> emergency <b>procedure</b> for adopting legislation in order to assure compatibility with the EU law, but also due to underdeveloped regulatory policies, which has been reduced to the guillotine of legislation, instead of developing a cycle of policy and analytical phase that precedes the drafting of legislation. Although the negotiating structure of European integration has been improved, the Negotiation Team and Coordination Body certainly can not replace the role of policy makers in their creation. Since the new Law on Ministries envisaged the creation of the Secretariat for the coordination of public policies, an institutional prerequisite for the implementation of the function of harmonizing public policy proposals has been put forward, but is not yet clear what powers in the policy cycle this institution would have. In any case, this administrative body will certainly complement Serbian coordination structure in the negotiation process...|$|R

The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, in partnership with Consumer Reports, initiated the “Choosing Wisely ” campaign to identify areas in patient care and resource use most open to improvement. Nine subspecialty organizations joined the campaign; each organization identified five tests, procedures, or therapies that are overused, are misused, or could potentially lead to harm or unnecessary health care spending. Each of the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN’s) 10 advisory groups submitted recommendations for inclusion. The ASN Quality and Patient Safety Task Force selected five recommendations based on relevance and importance to individuals with kidney disease. Recommendations selected were: (1) Do not perform routine cancer screening for dialysis patients with limited life expectancies without signs or symptoms; (2) donot administer erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to CKD patients with hemoglobin levels ‡ 10 g/dl without symptoms of anemia; (3) avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in individuals with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes, including diabetes; (4) do not place peripherally inserted central catheters in stage 3 – 5 CKD patients without consulting nephrology; (5) do not initiate chronic dialysis without ensuring a shared decision-making process between patients, their families, and their physicians.
