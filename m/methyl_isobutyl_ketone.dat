5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in <b>methyl</b> <b>isobutyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into <b>methyl</b> <b>isobutyl</b> <b>ketones</b> differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|R

500|$|Commercial {{zirconium}} metal typically contains 1–3% of hafnium, {{which is usually}} not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar.

The rate of oxidation in the the [Ru(III) + Ir(III) ] system is much faster than either in the Ru(III) or in Ir(III) catalyzed system. The order in [NBS] was found to be zero both in catalyzed as well as uncatalyzed reactions. However, the order in [ketone] changed from unity to a fractional one in metal ion catalyzed systems. On the basis of kinetic features, the most plausible mechanism involving the oxidation of [Ir(III) -ketone] by Ru(III) to give [Ir(V) -ketone] and Ru(I) in the rate limiting step is proposed. Ru(I) thus formed is oxidized by NBS to Ru(III) in a fast step is discussed and individual rate parameters were evaluated...|$|R

They can be applied successfully to predict phase equilibrium and excess properties {{in the development of}} chemical and separation processes. The main focus of this work was to investigate the possibility of absorbing selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using three selected UNIFAC group contribution methods. Absorption followed by subsequent stripping is the predominant available abatement technology of VOCs from flue gases prior to their release into the atmosphere. The original, modified and effective UNIFAC models were used in this work. The thirteen selected VOCs that have been considered in this research are: pentane, hexane, heptanes, trimethylamine, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane, butyl acetate, diethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone, ethyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and <b>isobutyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> The computation was done for solute VOC concentration of 8. 55 x 10 - 8 which is well in the infinite dilution region.

40|$|Plastic {{encapsulated}} components contain organics which {{turn into}} volatiles during heat exposures such as during solder reflow or during environmental testing. Moisture turning to steam {{is not the}} only vapor released from plastics during solder reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, the identity and the understanding of these volatiles would be of interest so as to improve manufacturing yields. Some of the vapors evolved during eutectic and lead-free solder reflow profiles of mold compounds are identified in this paper. At eutectic reflow peak temperatures of 220 °C, Epoxy Novolac mold compounds will release gases like carbon dioxide, moisture, <b>methyl</b> alcohol, benzene, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> as the residue solvent, triphenyl phosphine and N,N-dimethyl benzenemethanamine from the catalyst, and sometimes siloxanes from stress releasing agent. Some of the more dominant vapors include triphenyl phosphine(TPP) and triphenyl phosphine oxide(TPPO), water and methyl alcohol. Also, it was found that temperature ramping rates affected the rate of gases released. There was not a substantial difference in the composition of gases released for mold compounds between eutectic solder reflow temperatures and for the higher temperature of 260 °C for lead-free reflow. As expected, much less gas was released if the mold compounds were postmold cured for 4 hours. Gas evolution from polymer during heat exposure is inevitable, however, understanding evolved gas behavior can help reduce the amount evolved such as through proper material selection, post-curing and slower ramp-up, consequently this will improve adhesion variability and pop-corn susceptibility...|$|R

It would be of interest to know what and when the volatiles undergo thermal desorption and are released during high temperature exposures such as during solder reflow or during environmental testing, Moisture turning to steam is not the only vapor present during solder reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, this outgassing behavior is of particular significance to assist in the improvement of manufacturing yields. Using evolved gas analysis with gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer, vapors found from epoxy mold compounds are carbon dioxide, moisture, <b>methyl</b> alcohol, benzene, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> triphenyl phosphine and occasionally, siloxanes from stress releasing agents.

Gas evolution rate increased directly with temperature increase for both encapsulants and underfills. Gas evolution is lower at 220 °C than at 260 °C.
