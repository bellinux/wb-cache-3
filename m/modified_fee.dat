40|$|Congress and the Reagan Administration, in {{an effort}} to “contain” costs, are {{considering}} changes in the way physicians are paid when they care for Medicare patients. By examining the effects on quality of care of several alternative ways physicians might be paid, including <b>modified</b> <b>fee</b> for service, physician diagnosis-related groups and capitation through health maintenance organizations, we can predict the kinds of effects on quality of care most likely to occur and the kinds of patients most likely to be affected. Under each of the payment alternatives, poorer and sicker patients are at greatest risk for reduced access to care and quality of care. These findings underline the need for rigorous experiments to assess the effects of changes in physician payment on quality of care and the need for monitoring and assurance of quality in a new payment system...|$|E

30|$|In 1981, the {{government}} released {{the first official}} policy on pre-primary services - the White Paper on Primary Education and Pre-primary Services - only {{as a response to}} the increasing concern of the public about the alarmingly low percentage (13 %) of professionally trained teachers in local kindergartens (Hong Kong Government 1981, Opper 1992 b). The document outlined the need to accelerate training and required 45 % of kindergarten teachers to receive 120 -h part-time basic training to attain Qualified Assistant Kindergarten Teacher (QAKT) status by 1986, expanding to 90 % by 1992; while all principals should attain qualified kindergarten teacher status (QKT, equivalent to 2 -year part-time training) by 1986. It also recommended the minimum standards for adult-child ratios, space, materials, and equipment. Notwithstanding these targets, {{the government}}’s financial commitment to promoting teacher training remained limited (Pearson and Rao 2006). As a result, only 23 % of kindergarten teachers had been trained as QAKTs by 1986 (Rao and Li 2009). The Education Commissionc (1986) even concluded in its Report No. 2 that kindergarten education was not essential and therefore did not deserve aided sector status. Though the report did advocate various measures to enhance kindergarten education, such as a more stringent teacher-child ratio, higher professional levels of teacher training, and a <b>modified</b> <b>fee</b> assistance scheme for children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, as late as 1992 the Education Commission Report No. 5 made only brief mention of statutory staffing requirements and a fee remission scheme which covered only 5 % of children (Opper 1999; Pearson and Rao 2006).|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} should {{developing}} countries eschew conventional {{command and control}} environmental regulation that is increasingly seen as inefficient and rely instead on economic incentives? This paper addresses this question {{as it pertains to}} industrial air pollution. The paper discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various economic incentive instruments, presents in-depth case studies of their application in Sweden, the United States, China, and Poland, and proposes a number of policy guidelines. The authors argue that both design deficiencies and pervasive constraints on monitoring and enforcement impede the effectiveness of economic instruments in developing countries. The latter are difficult to rectify, at least in the medium term. As a result, tradable permits are generally not practical. Suitably <b>modified</b> however, emissions <b>fee</b> policies probably are appropriate. They can provide a foundation for a transition to an effective economic incentive system, and can raise much needed revenue for environmental projects and programs. In addition, if political opposition can be overcome, environmental taxes constitute a second-best but potentially effective pollution control instrument. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{conflict of interest}} between lawyers and clients is well known. If a lawyer is paid for his time regardless {{of the outcome of}} the case,the lawyer may wish to bring the case even when it is not {{in the best interest of}} the client, may spend more hours working on the case than the client would want, and may reject a settlement when the client would be better off if it were accepted. Alternatively, if the lawyer is compensated according to the conventional contingent fee arrangement — under which he is paid a fraction of any trial award or settlement but bears all of the cost of litigation — the lawyer may have an insufficient incentive to bring the case, may spend too little time working on it if it is brought, and may encourage a settlement when the client would be better off going to trial. In this article we propose a method of compensating lawyers that overcomes the conflict of interest between the lawyer and the client. Our system is a variation of the conventional contingent fee system, but, in contrast to that system, we would have the lawyer bear only a fraction of the cost of litigation — the same fraction that the lawyer obtains of the award or settlement. We demonstrate that when the fraction of the cost that the lawyer bears equals the fraction of the award or settlement that he obtains, he will have an incentive to do exactly what a knowledgeable client would want him to do with respect to accepting the case, spending time on the case, and settling the case. Under our <b>modified</b> contingent <b>fee</b> system, a third party would compensate the lawyer for a certain fraction of his costs, in return for which the lawyer would pay that party an up-front fee. In this way, the client would not bear any costs, even if the case is lost, just as under the conventional contingent fee system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insights}} on {{the workings of}} the market for expert services and investigates the e¤ects of entry on the incentives of experts to provide high quality services. Experts are motivated by reputational concerns and clients are characterized by an unobservable type which a¤ects their willingness to pay for the service and may a¤ect the informativeness of the performance of the expert as a signal of her talent, and the likelihood the expert succeeds in providing a high quality service. The paper shows that clients sorting a¤ects incentives through three channels: modifying current and future equilibrium <b>fees,</b> <b>modifying</b> the informativeness of good performance as a signal of expert talent, modifying the marginal e ¢ ciency of e¤ort. Entry of experts impacts the sorting behaviour of clients in equilibrium, and thus incentives of experts. The main result is that increased entry reduces incentives to exert e¤ort, although when clients types a¤ect the likelihood the service is provided successfully the opposite may occur. However, even when e¤ort is lower in equilibrium after increased entry, welfare may be larger as more clients can be served.

40|$|The City of Las Vegas Building and Safety Department (B 2 ̆ 6 S) {{is being}} forced to make a number of {{difficult}} decisions regarding the structure of fees charged for the various services it provides. Like many building departments nationwide, B 2 ̆ 6 S is experiencing the financial impact of the current economic decline affecting the construction industry. These fees directly affect B 2 ̆ 6 S’ ability to staff the department {{in a manner that}} enables them to deliver an adequate level of service. With construction permits issued by B 2 ̆ 6 S plummeting from an all-time high of 19, 147 in 2004 to 5, 093 in 2009, the department has reduced staffing levels from 124 employees in 2008 to 45 in 2010. Nevertheless, current methods for generating revenues are based on outdated fee and valuation schedules from 1997. State statutes, city ordinances, and administrative codes dictate how fees may be generated and place limitations on B 2 ̆ 6 S’ discretion in raising fees.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address why the three {{dominant}} alternatives to compensating physicians (fee-for-service, capitation, and salary) fall short of what is needed to support enhanced primary care in the patient-centered medical home, and the relevance of such payment reforms as pay-for-performance and episodes/bundling. The review illustrates why prevalent physician payment mechanisms in the US have failed to adequately support primary care and why innovative approaches to primary care payment play such a prominent role in the PCMH discussion. FFS payment for office visits has never effectively rewarded all the activities that comprise prototypical primary care and may contribute to the “hamster on a treadmill” problems in current medical practice. Capitation payments are associated with risk adjustment challenges and, perhaps, public perceptions of conflict with patients’ best interests. Most payers don’t employ and therefore cannot generally place physicians on salary; while in theory such salary payments might neutralize incentives, operationally, “time is money;” extra effort devoted to meeting the needs of a more complex patient will likely reduce the services available to others. Fee-for-service, the predominant physician payment scheme, has contributed to both the continuing decline in the primary care workforce and the capability to serve patients well. Yet, the conceptual alternative payment approaches, <b>modified</b> fee-for-service (including <b>fee</b> bundles), capitation, and salary, each have their own problems. Accordingly, new payment models will likely be required to support restoration of primary care to its proper role in the US health care system, and to promote and sustain the development of patient-centered medical homes...|$|R
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a {{fee simple}} estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other {{fee simple estate}}s in real property include fee simple defeasible (or fee simple determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: fee simple determinable and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a fee simple determinable. If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been <b>modified</b> by statute. <b>Fee</b> simple determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|R
