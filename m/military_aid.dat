5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in <b>military</b> <b>aid,</b> flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E

25|$|In early September 1973, Allende floated {{the idea}} of resolving the {{constitutional}} crisis with a plebiscite. His speech outlining such a solution was scheduled for 11 September, {{but he was never}} able to deliver it. On 11 September 1973, the Chilean <b>military,</b> <b>aided</b> by the United States and its CIA, staged a coup against Allende.|$|R
5000|$|On May 21, 2015, investigative {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that Pakistan had kept bin Laden {{under house arrest}} since 2006, that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani intelligence official and not through tracking a courier, [...] and that elements of the Pakistani <b>military</b> <b>aided</b> the U.S. in killing bin Laden. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|R
5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the early}} revolts in Kaga failed, unrest {{continued}} in the province, as the Ikkō-ikki would refuse to pay taxes and even seize tax revenues and land, despite Rennyo's admonitions of submission to the authorities. In 1487, possibly {{in an effort to}} secure a favor in the form of <b>military</b> <b>aid,</b> Masachika responded to shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa's call for <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> against Rokkaku Tokoyori in Ōmi Province. In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki launched a massive revolt, their forces numbering between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. Though Masachika quickly returned, the rebels, aided by several disgruntled former vassal families and nobility, overwhelmed him and trapped him in his castle, where he committed seppuku.|$|E
5|$|Between 1953 and 1968, the Spanish Army {{received}} {{a total of}} 446 medium battle tanks (M47s and M48s), 123 light tanks (M24s and M41s), as well as 30 armored recovery vehicles (the M74). In 1970, the United States agreed to extend the <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> program by another five years, giving Spain another 66 M48A2 tanks and 17 M41A3s.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} {{for the people of}} Liverpool were far greater than those in the capital. Left without an effective police presence, public order in some areas broke down and resulted in what the Liverpool Daily Post (4 August 1918) called 'an orgy of looting and rioting'. This continued for three or four days before the <b>military,</b> <b>aided</b> by non-striking police, brought the situation under control, but at the cost of several lives and more than 200 arrests for looting.|$|R
5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 billion worth of <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its <b>military</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite this agreement, in 93 or 92BC Parthia {{fought a}} war in Syria against the tribal leader Laodice and her Seleucid ally Antiochus X Eusebes (r.95–92?BC), killing the latter. When {{one of the last}} Seleucid monarchs, Demetrius III Eucaerus, {{attempted}} to besiege Beroea (modern Aleppo), Parthia sent <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to the inhabitants and Demetrius was defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 1055, {{after being}} outlawed for treason {{in the course}} of a comital power-struggle, English nobleman Ælfgar Leofricson (died 1062?) fled from England to Ireland.

50|$|Austria and Prussia withdrew their {{delegates from}} the Assembly, which {{was little more}} than a debating club. The radical members were forced to go to Stuttgart, where they sat from June 6-18 as a rump {{parliament}} until it too was dispersed by Württemberg troops. Armed uprisings in support of the constitution, especially in Saxony, the Palatinate and Baden were short-lived, as the local <b>military,</b> <b>aided</b> by Prussian troops, crushed them quickly. Leaders and participants, if caught, were executed or sentenced to long prison terms.|$|R
50|$|The Pakistani <b>Military,</b> <b>aided</b> by the United States and {{financed by}} Saudi Arabia, began helping the Mujahideen {{in setting up}} {{training}} camps and arming them. United States President Jimmy Carter had accepted the view that Soviet aggression could {{not be viewed as}} an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region. The uncertain scope of the final objective of Moscow in its sudden southward plunge made the American stake in an independent Pakistan all the more important.|$|R

A popular tourist destination among war veterans {{by way of the}} WWII Veteran's Homecoming Program. Camp Pangatian's liberation of World War II American prisoners of war held by the Japanese forces in January 1945 was the most successful rescue operation ever executed by the American <b>military</b> <b>aided</b> by the Filipino guerillas who were fighting the invaders. That tactical operation was immortalized in the movie The Great Raid.|$|R
5|$|In {{the naval}} Battle of Thurii, Tarentum appealed for <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to Pyrrhus, ruler of Epirus. Motivated by his {{diplomatic}} obligations to Tarentum, {{and a personal}} desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men and a contingent of war elephants on Italian soil in 280 BC, where his forces were joined by some Greek colonists and {{a portion of the}} Samnites who revolted against Roman control, taking up arms against Rome for the fourth time in seventy years.|$|E
5|$|Kagame's {{relations}} with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21million donation. The US has also frozen some of its <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> programme for Rwanda, although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to them. The Germans and the puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned {{for some time}} afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1942, the Allies {{provided}} <b>military</b> <b>aid,</b> {{and then}} they began imposing economic sanctions in 1943 to force Turkey to enter the war. The western Allied powers wanted Turkey to become engaged in a fight against Germany's eastern flank; however, Turkey was afraid of being overrun by the Russian and German armies, {{both of which were}} led by dictators.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{policies}} of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948. At {{the same time there}} was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay, Brazil and the Argentine {{provinces of}} Entre Rios and Corrientes joined in an {{offensive}} Alliance against Rosas on 29 May 1851.

5|$|When a {{diplomatic}} dispute between Rome and a Greek colony in Italy erupted into open warfare in a naval confrontation, the Greek colony appealed for <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to Pyrrhus, {{ruler of the}} northwestern Greek kingdom of Epirus.

5|$|After a {{few years}} of {{unsteady}} peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> sent to the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the <b>military</b> <b>aid</b> to the United States.|$|E
