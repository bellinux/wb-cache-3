25|$|Antaura is {{a female}} demon who causes {{migraine}} headaches.

Antaura, whose name <b>means</b> <b>something</b> like “Contrary Wind,” is said {{to come out of}} the sea. In the inscription, she is confronted by the Ephesian Artemis, who plays the role assigned to the male figures Solomon, Arlaph, and Sisinnios in Judaeo-Christian magic.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is usually}} {{translated}} as 'element' the Chinese word xing literally <b>means</b> <b>something</b> like 'changing states of being', 'permutations' or 'metamorphoses of being'. In fact, Sinologists cannot agree on one single translation. The Chinese conception of 'element' is therefore {{quite different from the}} Western one. The Western elements were seen as the basic building blocks of matter. The Chinese 'elements', by contrast, were seen as ever changing and translation of xing is simply 'the five changes'.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still <b>means</b> <b>something</b> more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, is more than a cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} Gee’s {{identity}} perspectives {{is what he}} calls “the nature perspective (or N-identities)” (p.101). N-identity represents an identity people cannot control, one that comes from forces of nature. An example {{of this type of}} identity would be male or female. While the person has no control over the sex they were born with, this identity only <b>means</b> <b>something</b> because society and culture say this biological difference is important. Gee explains this idea further by stating, “N-identities must always gain their force as identities through the work of institutions, discourse and dialogue, or affinity groups, that is, the very forces that constitute our other perspectives on identity” (p.102).|$|E
25|$|In Tunisian Arabic, as {{in other}} Semitic languages, the {{creation}} of new words is based on a root and pattern system, also known as the Semitic root. That means that new words can be created through the association of a root that is composed most of the time of three letters that have a meaning with a rhythm or pattern that informs about the position of the object in the fact. For example, K-T-B is a root meaning to write and مفعول mafʿūl is a pattern meaning that the object submitted the fact. Thus, the combination of the root and the given pattern render maKTūB, which <b>means</b> <b>something</b> that was written.|$|E

25|$|The term non-kosher <b>means</b> <b>something</b> is {{not allowed}} as food—non-kosher animals (e.g., pigs, camels, and turtles) were already {{generally}} prohibited, and questions {{about the status of}} mixtures involving their meat and milk would be somewhat academic. Nevertheless, the lack of a classical decision about milk and meat of non-kosher animals gave rise to argument in the late Middle Ages. Some, such as Yoel Sirkis and Joshua Falk, argued that mixing milk and meat from non-kosher animals should be prohibited, but others, like Shabbatai ben Meir and David HaLevi Segal, argued that, excluding the general ban on non-kosher animals, such mixtures should not be prohibited.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City {{on a budget}} of $85million ($75million after tax rebates). Production {{designer}} Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle. Zea populated the apartment {{with an assortment of}} art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol. Explaining her decision, Zea said [...] "These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. They want to have art on their walls that <b>means</b> <b>something</b> and shows people, just like a car, that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.'" ...|$|E

500|$|According to the series' {{director}} Gorō Taniguchi, {{the idea}} for s-CRY-ed originated in 1999 {{when he was working}} on the series Infinite Ryvius. One of Infinite Ryviuss themes was people communicating with each other. The series' staff wanted to show people already on their own paths, focusing more on individualism. With the storyline beginning in the early 21st century, Taniguchi said the cast would already have adapted to the new times allowing s-CRY-ed to take more themes from Infinite Ryvius. The title s-CRY-ed is basically a combination of one English word and Japanese. The first lower-case [...] "s" [...] is a representation of the Japanese word su which <b>means</b> <b>something</b> in its natural form and not artificial. [...] "Cry" [...] comes from the English, and the last [...] "ed" [...] represents a person. Combined as [...] "s-CRY-ed" [...] the Sunrise studio staff wanted it to express the idea of how people react or interact when they are in their most natural state. They had devised the word when the project was in its early phases of production, and while {{it was meant to be}} a temporary name, the staff ended up using it as the title.|$|E

[...] Twelve years previously (1999), the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause, but have neither been seen nor heard of since. [...] Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley (Channing) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case. [...] Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers (Long) due to the latter's potential as an intuitive savant. [...] Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building, Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant, a college professor of [...] "advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design."

[...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode.

The original source material for these scripts was Guevara's diary from the Cuban Revolution, Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War, and from his time in Bolivia, Bolivian Diary. From there, he drew on interviews with people who knew Guevara from both of those time periods and read every book available that pertained to both Cuba and Bolivia. Bickford and Del Toro met with Harry [...] "Pombo" [...] Villegas, Urbano and Benigno—three men who met Guevara during the Cuban Revolution, followed him to Bolivia, and survived. They interviewed them individually and then Pombo and Benigno together about their experiences in Cuba and Bolivia.
