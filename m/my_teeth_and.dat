60|$|I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> {{turned slowly}} round. I even took the cup from the tray without {{spilling}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{like to keep}} <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> claws sharpened,' said Percy; but {{one wants}} repose at home. That burgomaster is my model.' ...|$|E
60|$|I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> clasped {{both arms}} round Mary as he spoke. I had {{inherited}} {{some of his}} temper, and he was now to know it.|$|E
5000|$|... nepitt (neeput) , <b>my</b> <b>tooth,</b> <b>and</b> nepitteash (neeputeash) , <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> from PA *ni·piči (singular) [...] via PEA *nīpītar (plural).|$|R
60|$|I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> hard <b>and</b> looked {{steadily}} {{down at the}} tablecloth. I felt {{rather than}} saw that her regard was compassionate.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's not {{fourteen}}." [...] "I'll lay fourteen of <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> [...] <b>And</b> yet, to my teen be it spoken, I {{have but}} four,-- [...] She is not fourteen."-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I can set <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> {{go ahead}} now, thanks to you, Mr. Armstrong," [...] I said. [...] "I was heading {{straight}} for failure when I came here last spring; but you've changed my course." ...|$|E
60|$|I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> {{advanced}} {{towards the}} dead man. John Hefford proved {{at once that}} he was superior to all such trifles as nerves. He lifted the body up and laid {{it for the first}} time flat upon the sands.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I's mighty {{glad to hear}} dat,' {{said the}} woman, 'I's mighty glad to hear dat, for I hasn't slep' one wink for dis tooth. Mr. Bro'nsill he allus pulls <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> dey nebber has been one what ached as bad as dis.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It's {{no use for}} {{me to try to}} show it, Mr. Hedgehog, because I've had {{the pain}} so long that I've {{regularly}} got the lock-jaw. If you'd be willing to let me have one of your stoutest quills I'm most certain I could fix the thing up myself. You see, I've got the thick part of a snail's shell in <b>my</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> the minute that is out I'll be all right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|CRAMPTON (irritably). I {{advise you}} to get <b>my</b> <b>tooth</b> out <b>and</b> have done {{reminding}} me of my wife. Come along, man. (He grips {{the arms of the}} chair and braces himself.) ...|$|R
6000|$|I ran upstairs into my room, and bathed my forehead, and re-arranged my gown. Then I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> together, <b>and</b> {{went down}} to him. It {{was to be a}} battle! Well! I was prepared! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, August Naab, I know," [...] {{replied the}} little man, bitterly. [...] "You would cast the Scriptures in <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> liken {{this man to}} one who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. But I've {{suffered}} enough {{at the hands of}} Dene." ...|$|E
6000|$|The snowflakes--the airflakes--danced {{in about}} me, as I tried with {{chilling}} hands to thrust the valve in and spun it tight and hard. I sobbed. [...] "I will," [...] I chattered in <b>my</b> <b>teeth.</b> <b>And</b> then, with fingers that quivered and felt brittle, I {{turned to the}} shutter studs.|$|E
6000|$|Some blue-bloused {{men looked}} up from their work in the {{vineyards}} a long way off. It {{was no time for}} hesitation. I set <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> I caught hold of the woman's arms. Her bones cracked in my hands before she let go. Isobel at last was free! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must be rubbed down {{morning and}} evening with rain water, my barley must be boiled in milk, because of <b>my</b> bad <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> feet must be washed in oil.' ...|$|R
60|$|And yet {{in half an}} hour I had {{staggered}} to my feet again, {{shivering in}} every limb, <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> chattering, <b>and</b> there I stood staring with the eyes of a maniac into that room of death.|$|R
5000|$|Percy Carey {{grew up in}} the Upper West Side {{section of}} Manhattan. His neighbor, Morgan Freeman, helped arrange for him to be cast as a child actor on Sesame Street, he first {{appeared}} in Season 7, Episode 0806. He appeared on the show from Age 5 to around Age 9. [...] "One episode, I lost <b>my</b> <b>tooth,</b> <b>and</b> me and Big Bird had to go through Sesame Street and try to find it," [...] Carey remembers. The idea for that episode came about after Carey told Jim Henson about a dream he'd had the night before.|$|R
60|$|With that I made my mind up, {{took out}} my gully, opened it with <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> cut one strand after another, till the vessel only swung by two. Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more {{lightened}} by {{a breath of}} wind.|$|E
60|$|The wall {{of marble}} block was four feet six high now, and hope rose in my teeth as I leaned there against it a miserable {{helpless}} log, and ground <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> watched that glorious struggle. I {{could do no}} more for I had lost my revolver in the battle.|$|E
60|$|I did. And I {{paid back}} the {{borrowed}} money, and gritted <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> started to cram by myself. There were three months yet before the university entrance examinations. Without laboratories, without coaching, {{sitting in my}} bedroom, I proceeded to compress that two years' work into three months and to keep reviewed on the previous year's work.|$|E
5000|$|... "A silver spoon {{was never}} mine. I cut <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> on tears. <b>And</b> {{all the things}} that men call fine have passed me down the years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] the {{newcomer}} said, with an angry scowl. [...] "Any beauty I once {{may have had}} is gone forever. I have lost three of <b>my</b> upper <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> two of <b>my</b> lower, and I am learning now to speak with my lips shut, so as to hide the gap." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray Eberle {{went on to}} find {{success with}} Miller, deeming the songs for Orchestra Wives, such as the jazz {{standard}} [...] "At Last", to be among his favorites as there were songs he could [...] "sink <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> into, <b>and</b> make a story out of". He appeared in the Twentieth Century Fox movies, Sun Valley Serenade (1941) and Orchestra Wives (1942).|$|R
6000|$|... "That’ll do," [...] said Mr. Gribble, decidedly. [...] "That’ll do. One o’ {{these days}} you’ll go too far. You start {{throwing}} {{that money in}} <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> see what happens. I’ve done my best for you all these years, and there’s no reason to suppose I sha’n’t go on doing so. What did you say? What!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{she held}} the broken pieces together, and I ties 'em up {{with the aid of}} my hand and <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> makes a strong, ship-shape job of it. I did it sitting on the bottom step, with a child {{standing}} on each side watching me. When I had done it the eldest took it, and felt it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{throw your}} {{benefits}} in <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> reproach {{me with my}} birth," [...] broke in Adrian, who by now was almost raving with passion, [...] "as {{though it were a}} crime in me to have other blood running in my veins than that of Netherlander tradesfolk. Well, if so, {{it would seem that the}} crime was my mother's, and not mine, who----" ...|$|E
60|$|REGINALD. No: I'm dashed if you have. I'll {{fight for}} the {{ownership}} of <b>my</b> own children <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> nail; and so will a good many other fellows, I can tell you.|$|R
5000|$|JBU is {{a massive}} read. Even at an {{accelerated}} pace, with a deadline looming, it took me days to read it all. This is what I want from a magazine: a variety of stories to get <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> into <b>and</b> some non-fiction to leaven the mixture. The only drawback was that I couldn't take it with me to my usual reading place—it just isn't possible to snuggle up {{in bed with a}} computer.|$|R
60|$|Antoine {{complained in}} groans; Gilles growled openly, and went {{the length of}} begging me, as we rode through the ill-paved, flooded streets of Fenouillet, to go no farther. But I was adamant in my resolve. Soaked to the skin, my clothes hanging sodden about me, and chilled to the marrow though I was, I set <b>my</b> {{chattering}} <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> swore {{that we should not}} sleep until we reached Toulouse.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{concerned}} in you!" [...] I answered passionately. [...] "Felicia, you drive me almost wild {{when you talk}} like this. You {{know very well that}} it is not curiosity which has made me set <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> swear that I will discover the truth of these things. It is because I see you implicated in them, because I believe in you, Felicia, because I love you!" ...|$|E
60|$|In reply his lance came {{whirling}} in the {{air over}} my head, and mortally transfixed poor Foggarty of ours, who was behind me. Grinding <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> swearing horribly, I drew that scimitar which never yet failed its blow, {2} and rushed at the Indian. He came down at full gallop, his own sword making ten thousand gleaming circles {{in the air}}, shrieking his cry of battle.|$|E
60|$|Now I was puffing tremendously, but no smoke came. The room {{returned}} to me, I saw Jimmy clearly, I felt Marriot overhead, and I heard them all whispering. Still I puffed; I {{knew that my}} pipe was empty, but still I puffed. Gilray's fingers tried to draw my brier from my mouth, but I bit into it with <b>my</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> still I puffed.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. No, I won't: you'll {{throw it}} in <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> {{afterwards}} <b>and</b> accuse me of disrespect. I say it's a heartbreaking falsehood that I don't respect you. It's true that I didn't respect your old pride: why should I? It was nothing but cowardice. I didn't respect your intellect: I've a better one myself: it's a masculine specialty. But when the depths stirred!---when my moment came!---when you made me brave!---ah, then, then, t h e n! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had gone}} down two steps, when, in the dark, I missed the third, the bells in my cap jangling at the shock. I brought <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> stood breathless in apprehension, fearing that the noise might awaken him, and cursing myself for a careless fool to have forgotten those infernal bells. Above me I heard a warning hiss from old Mariani, which, if anything, increased my dread. But Ramiro snored on, and I was reassured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} know, Mildred, I detest your friend Lord Minster, the mere sight of him sets <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> on edge, <b>and</b> I {{did not want to}} meet him. I only came here to-day because Lady Florence told me that they were going up to the Convent this afternoon." ...|$|R
