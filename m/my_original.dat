[...] When asked about the Indo-British political situation he had no comment, but his followers explained that he had told Gandhi to abandon politics.|$|E

Matheos would send Moore guitar, keyboard and programming parts; Moore would then [...] "chop them up and stuff". Matheos considers the writing process for OSI as more collaborative than writing for his other band, Fates Warning: [...] "With Fates I write songs and we don’t really change a whole lot from my final version to the version that goes on the record," [...] he said. [...] "With Kevin it's much more collaborative in that I come up with a song idea and it can change completely from <b>my</b> <b>original</b> idea to the final product on the record." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the way to}} Constantinople, Cacambo {{reveals that}} Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes {{on the banks of}} the Propontis as a slave for a Transylvanian prince by the name of Rákóczi. After {{arriving}} at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: [...] "I still hold to <b>my</b> <b>original</b> opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis saw his {{character}} as a romantic hero. Carter and Spotnitz, however, {{did not want}} [...] "Scully trusting this man she's spent seven years hating" [...] so easily. Eventually, the producers tweaked the script, adding [...] "the reality of The X-Filess existing mythos and past character development" [...] to ease the transition. Davis later noted, [...] "I was basically {{happy with the way}} [...] turned out, despite {{the fact that there were}} many other ideas that I had that I did not get to see. <b>My</b> <b>original</b> conception of the story was that Cigarette-Smoking Man was a much better actor at winning Scully's affections and that Scully was less resistant to this attention to her." [...] Because The Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{it with a}} B+.

[...] Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times praised the episode's use of a [...] "Harold", in which three separate plots working off a central theme converge together. He also loved the climatic scene involving a gunshot-induced deaf Peter and the subway. [...] "I hope more people were watching this episode for so many reasons: To see how good [...] "Fringe" [...] has become, to get addicted to the show and, most important, {{to see that they}} quoted my blog in the promo for next week. Thursday night has become [...] "Fringe" [...] night".|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from <b>my</b> <b>original</b> views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} with TSR, Gygax had often {{mentioned}} the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax {{announced that he was}} again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for Castles and Crusades rather than D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: [...] "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both <b>my</b> <b>original</b> design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope." [...] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name [...] "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to [...] "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to [...] "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials [...] "E.G.G." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of the film's {{distinctive}} features is its score, written {{in three days}} by John Carpenter and performed by Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. Carpenter, assisted by Dan Wyman, had several banks of synthesizers that would each have to be reset when another sound had to be created, taking {{a great deal of}} time. [...] "When I did <b>my</b> <b>original</b> themes for [...] … it was done with very old technology," [...] replied Carpenter. [...] "It was very difficult to get the sounds, and it took very long to get something simple." [...] Carpenter made roughly three to five separate pieces of music and edited them to the film as appropriate.|$|E

I briefly considered a recast, but it just didn't sit right. And you never know, maybe someone else can woo Sue Tully to come back." [...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. But there are ways around that!

2500|$|While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical {{parallels}} in the book, Truman Capote, {{mentioning the}} character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered autobiographical: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>original</b> version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man {{living in the}} house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true.

2500|$|That {{story had}} {{its origins in}} Price's enthusiasm for an earlier Lovecraft tale.

[...] "In telling him of the pleasure I had had in rereading it, I suggested a sequel to account for protagonist Randolph Carter's doings after his disappearance." [...] After convincing an apparently reluctant Lovecraft to collaborate on such a sequel, Price wrote a 6,000-word draft in August 1932; in April 1933, Lovecraft produced a 14,000-word version that left unchanged, by Price's estimate, [...] "fewer than fifty of <b>my</b> <b>original</b> words," [...] though An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia reports that Lovecraft [...] "kept as many of Price's conceptions as possible, {{as well as some}} of his language." ...|$|E

It was he who gave me the idea for <b>my</b> <b>original</b> stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off.

2500|$|On October 31, 1996, Huckabee met {{privately with}} {{the parole board}} {{to talk about the}} DuMond case. The Arkansas Times has argued that this closed-door meeting {{appeared}} to violate Arkansas' FOIA law. [...] On January 16, 1997, DuMond was granted parole, just five months after he had been rejected. Huckabee released a statement saying, [...] "I concur with the board's action and hope the lives of all those involved can move forward. The action of the board accomplishes what I sought to do in considering an earlier request for commutation ...In light of the action of the board, <b>my</b> <b>original</b> intent to commute the sentence to time served is no longer relevant." [...] The parole was granted on the condition that DuMond leave the state.

As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious.
