40|$|Abstract. In <b>multi</b> <b>access</b> network environments, mobile {{stations}} may encounter multiple choices for selecting an access network. Carefully designed access selection schemes can provide not only mobile users with better services but also network operators with better resource utilizations. It is also envisioned that further improvements {{can be achieved}} by redistributing {{mobile stations}} from one access network to anther (i. e., vertical handovers). Such decisions should be made by following carefully designed, yet simple to implement, protocols. In this paper, we present a cost-based scheme for access selection and vertical handover decision algorithms. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a Java-based simulator called MANSim (Multiple Access Network Simulator) that we developed. Our simulation results show that during the congested periods, the network throughput is significantly improved with greatly reduced call drop rate.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the comparative performance of two detection schemes based on subtraction detection technique for a hybrid scheme of subcarrier multiplexed spectral-amplitude-coding optical code {{division multiple access}} (SCM SAC-OCDMA) system. SAC-OCDMA systems are receiving more attention because of their ability to completely eliminate <b>multi</b> <b>access</b> interference by using code sequences with fixed in-phase cross correlation. On the other hand, the SCM scheme is capable of improving the channel data rate of OCDMA systems. This hybrid scheme is proposed for the benefit of combining the advantages of both schemes. Consequently, the hybrid system is robust against interference and is much more spectrally efficient. Double weight code family is a new code structure used for SAC-OCDMA system. The experimental simulation results show that the proposed new AND subtraction detection technique improve the system performance significantly.

It is shown that high reception {{capacity of the}} channel allows the access algorithm to be simpler without losing performance. 1 INTRODUCTION Only recently people have started to look at random <b>multi</b> <b>access</b> systems with multiple reception capacity. In the classical model {{it is assumed that}} whenever two or more packets attempt transmission simultaneously, a collision occurs and none of the packets is received correctly. It has been shown that by using adequate coding, more than one packet can be transmitted without any error. The maximum number of packets that can be correctly received simultaneously on a channel will be referred to as its reception capacity. The reception capacity will depend upon the coding being used. The Aloha-like algorithm for a channel with multiple reception capacity has [...] ...|$|R
