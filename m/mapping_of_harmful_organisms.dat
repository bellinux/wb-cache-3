40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions <b>of</b> interceptions <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs <b>of</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs <b>of</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination <b>of</b> interceptions <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> supports application <b>of</b> reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs <b>of</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> into the EU.

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is a well-characterised virus of the family Nanoviridae, which infects banana and plantain. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Although the pest risk assessment could be improved, and additional information provided to substantiate the statements made and ratings given in the assessment, the Panel agrees with the conclusion of the French document that the phytosanitary risk associated with BBTV is extremely high. BBTV is a highly pathogenic agent for banana, and thus the Panel concludes that the negative economic consequences of its introduction are very high, both for commercial plantations of dessert bananas in Guadeloupe and Martinique and production of plantain and cooking banana in small holdings and private gardens throughout the PRA area[4]. The Panel concludes that BBTV has a high probability of entry and a high probability of establishment in the French overseas departments, and that the international movement of large quantities of vitroplants represents the most important entry pathway. The Panel further considers that virus indexing of mother plants used for vitroplant production, provides an effective means to prevent entry of BBTV. The overall conclusion of the Panel is that BBTV is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R
