6000|$|In {{their little}} {{tour of the}} house our young friend and his {{companion}} had had a great many fellow visitors, who had also arrived by the steamer and who had hitherto not left them an ideal privacy. But the others gradually dispersed; they circled about a kind of showman who was the authorised guide, a big slow genial vulgar heavily- bearded man, with a whimsical edifying patronising tone, a tone that had immense success when he stopped here and there to make his points--to pass his eyes over his listening flock, then fix them quite above it with a meditative look and bring out some ancient pleasantry {{as if it were}} a sudden inspiration. He made a cheerful thing, an echo of the platform before the booth of a country fair, even of a visit to the tomb of the pater patriae. It is enshrined in a kind of grotto in the grounds, and Vogelstein remarked to Pandora that he was a good man for the place, but was too familiar. [...] "Oh he'd have been familiar with Washington," [...] said the girl with the bright dryness with which she often uttered amusing things. Vogelstein looked at her a moment, and it came over him, as he smiled, that she herself probably wouldn't have been abashed even by the hero with whom history has taken fewest liberties. [...] "You look as if you could hardly believe that," [...] Pandora went on. [...] "You Germans are always in such awe of great people." [...] And it occurred to her critic that perhaps after all Washington would have liked her manner, which was wonderfully fresh and natural. The man with the beard was an ideal minister to American shrines; he played on the curiosity of his little band with the touch of a <b>master,</b> <b>drawing</b> them at the right moment away to see the classic ice-house where the old lady had been found weeping in the belief it was Washington's grave. While this monument was under inspection our interesting couple had the house to themselves, and they spent some time on a pretty terrace where certain windows of the second floor opened--a little rootless verandah which overhung, in a manner, obliquely, all the magnificence of the view; the immense sweep of the river, the artistic plantations, the last-century garden with its big box hedges and remains of old espaliers. They lingered here for nearly half an hour, and it was in this retirement that Vogelstein enjoyed the only approach to intimate conversation appointed for him, as was to appear, with a young woman in whom he had been unable to persuade himself that he was not absorbed. It's not necessary, and it's not possible, that I should reproduce this colloquy; but I may mention that it began--as they leaned against the parapet of the terrace and heard the cheerful voice of the showman wafted up to them from a distance--with his saying to her rather abruptly that he couldn't make out why they hadn't had more talk together when they crossed the Atlantic.|$|E

5000|$|July 1935 the Museum Boijmans in Rotterdam, {{opened its}} doors to a newly by Ad van der Steur {{designed}} building on the Mathenesserlaan in Rotterdam. Still in the old building of Museum Boijmans 'Het Schielandhuis' Franz Koenigs showed in 1934 his Dutch drawings from the 15th, 16th and 17th century. At {{the end of the}} year, December 1934 till January 1935 [...] the Boijmans exhibited hundred French Drawings from the F. Koenigs Collection when the new museum building was ending its final stage of construction. As a patron of the Arts Franz Koenigs was looking for a museum to house his Collection of Old Master Paintings, consisting of 46 paintings of which 20 were by Rubens and 4 by Jheronimus Bosch and his Old <b>Master</b> <b>Drawing</b> Collection consisting of 2144 Drawings. In April 1935 it was announced that Franz Koenigs would lent his Old Master Painting Collection and his Old <b>Master</b> <b>Drawing</b> Collection, for a minimal period of 10 years to the new Museum Boijmans.|$|E
50|$|Whatever {{scheme was}} {{standardized}} in each shop {{had to be}} documented. Colored lines were entered on the blue-line drawing using colored pencils and identified there. Once the modification process was complete, the red-lined blue-line prints were taken to document control, where the original master was modified to reflect the changes made during the engineering process. New blue-line prints would then {{be made of the}} modified master, and the process continued in this iterative manner until completion of the project. The <b>master</b> <b>drawing,</b> incorporating all changes and including the authorizing signatures, was finally archived in a vault.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1980s, {{typesetting}} moved from metal to photo composition. During this time, type design {{made a similar}} transition from physical matrixes to hand drawn letters on vellum or mylar and then the precise cutting of [...] "rubyliths." [...] Rubylith was a common material in the printing trade, in which a red transparent film, very soft and pliable, was bonded to a supporting clear acetate. Placing the ruby over the <b>master</b> <b>drawing</b> of the letter, the craftsman would gently and precisely cut through the upper film and peel the non-image portions away. The resulting letterform, now existing as the remaining red material still adhering to the clear substrate, would then be ready to be photographed using a reproduction camera.|$|E

5000|$|Sutherland was {{inspired}} by the Memex from [...] "As We May Think" [...] by Vannevar Bush. Sketchpad inspired Douglas Engelbart to design and develop oN-Line System at the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) during the 1960s.Sketchpad was the first program ever to utilize a complete graphical user interface, using an x-y point plotter display and the recently invented light pen. The clever way the program organized its geometric data pioneered the use of [...] "objects" [...] and [...] "instances" [...] in computing and pointed forward to object oriented programming. The main idea was to have master drawings which one could instantiate into many duplicates. If the user changed the <b>master</b> <b>drawing,</b> all the instances would change as well. Another major invention in Sketchpad was that it let the user easily constrain geometric properties in the drawing - for instance, the length of a line or the angle between two lines could be fixed.|$|E
50|$|The {{wire-cut}} type {{of machine}} {{arose in the}} 1960s {{for the purpose of}} making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of material from the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched-tape vertical milling machines. The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut EDM machine was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a <b>master</b> <b>drawing</b> were developed by David H. Dulebohn's group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering Company for milling and grinding machines. Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut EDM machine using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the EDM machine, and the first CNC EDM machine was produced in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|Solving various {{problems}} {{in the development of}} his mammoth works, Steele employs largely forgotten Renaissance period processes. He is known for creating full size drawings, referred to as “cartoons,” which attract attention in their own right, as opposed to other artists who may use such drawings as only preliminary sketches. Steele's venture into the public art arena was marked by the “Angel of Unity,” executed for a city-related public art project noted in the Los Angeles Times on June 5, 2003. It explores the archetypical commonalities of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In December 2008 the Carnegie Art Museum commissioned and acquired to its permanent collection Steele's major <b>master</b> <b>drawing</b> [...] "Quiet Steps of Approaching Thunder" [...] (72 x 48) which links figurative art to our era of crisis.Continuing work on his large scale drawings, in August 2011 he exhibited an epic cartoon measuring 100" [...] X 80" [...] titled [...] "Rising: Jaboy, Christian, Derron, Michael, Luis" [...] in [...] "The New Romantic Figure", a ground breaking group show of figurative works by prominent Californian artists at California Lutheran University's Kwan Fong Gallery.|$|E

40|$|A proof book is {{one part}} of {{creating}} a chromolithographic label. First, an artist paints what is called original art. This is painted by hand, usually to scale, and has hand applied embossing. Once the original art is approved, the master lithographer creates a keyline drawing. This drawing {{is used as a}} tool to determine the colors and the number of stones to create the desired effect. A keyline looks like a topographic map with many contour lines. These lines show the location of the color boundaries. Now, the specially prepared Bavarian limestones are engraved. One stone is engraved for each color used. A <b>master</b> <b>drawing</b> is used on each stone to assure proper registration. Several prints may be run by hand. Prints from each stone could be run by hand during the engraving process too. Next, the stones are setup on the press, aligned, and a proof is printed. By the time a proof book is generated the label is ready for production. Later, if additional prints are required a proof book will act as a blueprint to setup the the press. The progressive book is used to match ink colors, align the stones, and check the total quality of the print run.
