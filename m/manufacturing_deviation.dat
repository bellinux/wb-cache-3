In this paper, a novel deviation representation method for cylindrical surface is proposed. Instead of the Cartesian coordinate system, a two-dimensional curvilinear coordinate system is established on the ideal cylindrical surface to represent the surface. By adding a deviation dimension in the curvilinear coordinates, a deviation coordinate system is constructed to represent the non-ideal cylindrical surface. The data mapping between the two coordinate systems is presented and typical cylindrical surfaces with deviations are provided as examples to illustrate the formulated deviation representation approach...|$|E

Also, the descriptions provided in actual solid and feature based design modelers are inadequate to ascertain a clear taxonomy of tolerance specifications, neither do they help address the assembly tolerance analysis and/or synthesis issues.

The three flight test phases included: (1) assessment of an unpainted airframe, (2) flight tests of the same airplane after painstakingly filling and sanding the wings to design contours, and (3) similar measurements after this airplane was painted. In each flight phase, transition locations were monitored using either sublimating chemicals or pigmented oil. As expected, total drag changes were difficult to measure. Two-dimensional drag coefficients were estimated using the Eppler-Somers code and measured with a wake rake in a method very similar to Jones' pitot traverse method.

40|$|Low- and medium-temperature {{industrial}} process heat demand represents {{a significant proportion of}} the total energy consumed within Australia. Currently, the overwhelming majority of this heat is generated via the combustion of natural gas, with a smaller contribution by electric resistance heating and heat pumps. In order to reduce fossil fuel consumption a renewable alternative process heat supply is highly desirable. Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CPCs) are low-optical-concentration non-imaging solar collectors which are capable of concentrating solar radiation over a broad range of acceptance angles. For this reason, CPCs lend themselves well to non-tracking, roof mounted applications for the generation of low- and medium-temperature thermal energy. The authors have presented a second paper describing an ab initio CPC design, however this presents a number of manufacturing challenges: precise geometric tolerances must be met in order to ensure high optical efficiency; a reflector substrate was required to meet the geometric specification while achieving a high-quality surface finish to maximize mirror reflectance; and a new evacuated tube absorber was developed to address the specific geometric and hydraulic needs.

The synthesis technique makes use of distributed models, which are a halfway point between the fast but imprecise lumped circuit models, and the more accurate but costly full-wave electromagnetic models. An automatic software tool to design this type of filters has also been developed, which is able to obtain the physical dimensions of the filter in a matter of minutes. A new technique to correct <b>manufacturing</b> <b>deviations</b> in CWDM filters is proposed next, which avoids the use of tuning screws. Instead, fixed squared insertions are employed, which can be fabricated in separated pieces. An space mapping technique is used to calculate the dimensions of these pieces and, after few iterations, the procedure is able to achieve the required response. A systematic method to design manifold-coupled multiplexers is also presented, which also employs distributed models. First, the design of classic multiplexers with CWDM filters is considered.

The apparatus is comprised of a device to supply the tracer gas uniformly into the zone, a device to ensure a uniform concentration both in the vertical and horizontal directions, a device to collect the air samples and a gas analyzer to measure the gas concentration according to the infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy technique. Tests were carried out with three distinct refrigerators, with the compressor on and off, using both the concentration decay and constant concentration measurement techniques. A high level of repeatability in the air infiltration rate measurements has been found, with deviations always lower than 5 %. It was also noted that the two measurement techniques provide practically the same results. Furthermore, it was observed that the air infiltration rate is approximately five times higher when the compressor is turned on due to the higher pressure difference created by the higher temperature difference. Adsorption tests were also carried out indicating that the adsorption of the tracer gas by the refrigerator materials and gasket is insignificant when compared to the concentration variations caused by air infiltration. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>deviations</b> were also simulated and it was found that they greatly increase the air infiltration rate through the gasket.

40|$|Contemporary {{composite}} part development and manufacturing, in particular of high performance light weight structures, is still challenging. Great efforts {{are needed in}} order to find optimal process parameters and to meet required qualities and tolerances. However, depending on the complexity of the part {{as well as on the}} selected process technology and material type the resulting products still contain different <b>manufacturing</b> <b>deviations</b> that effect the structural properties. As a consequence several conservatisms rule the development and manufacturing process of light weight structures. On the one hand this prevents the exploitation of structural reserves. On the other hand non-added value manufacturing and rework processes unnecessarily increase manufacturing costs, waste of material and energy consumption. This paper describes an innovative composite manufacturing concept with an integrated in-situ structural evaluation process in order to enable an automated and individual assessment of structural properties and performance from a global perspective. This concept, which was developed within the European funded project ECOMISE, requires the following steps: Prior to manufacturing typical manufacturing features such as locally varying fibre architecture or temperature variations are studied based on experience from previous manufacturing as well as from probabilistic process simulation. Further, the effects of features on the structural properties are investigated for the expected parameter ranges. So-called surrogate models and databases are derived based on this knowledge enabling full probabilistic analysis and fast process optimization, while taking into account robustness requirements. During manufacturing the real detected features are provided by online monitoring systems. This information in turn serves for an in-situ structural evaluation of their effect on the overall structural performance directly during manufacturing. Moreover, an in-situ decision making and process adjustment are derived to reestablish the required part properties. For verification and validation of this integrated manufacturing concept tests are performed by manufacturing representative coupon structures as well as industrial demonstrators. Results are presented in detail. Thus, key technologies are provided for industry 4. 0 in order to maximize process efficiency at reduced cost and time while maintaining structural requirements...|$|R

The proposed approach targets at the investigation of industrial applicability of evolvable hardware concepts and to merge it with reconfigurable or programmable analog concepts, and industrial electronics standards and needs for next generation robust and flexible sensor systems. The devised programmable sensor signal conditioning test chips, namely FPMA 1 /FPMA 2, designed in 0. 35 µm (C 35 B 4) Austriamicrosystems, can be used as a single instance, off the shelf chip at the PCB level for conditioning or in the loop with dedicated software to inherit the aspired self-x features. The use of such self–x sensor system carries the promise of improved flexibility, better accuracy and reduced vulnerability to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>deviations</b> and drift. An embedded system, namely PHYTEC miniMODUL- 515 C was used to program and characterize the mixed-signal test chips in various feedback arrangements to answer some of the questions raised by the research goals. Wide range of established analog circuits, ranging from single output to fully differential amplifiers, was investigated at different hierarchical levels to realize circuits like instrumentation amplifier and filters. A more extensive design issues based on low-power like for e. g., sub-threshold design were investigated and a novel soft sleep mode idea was proposed. The bandwidth limitations observed in the state of the art fine granular approaches were enhanced by the proposed intermediate granular approach. The so designed sensor signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier was then compared to the commercially available products in the market like LT 1167, INA 125 and AD 8250. In an adaptive prototype, evolutionary approaches, in particular based on particle swarm optimization with multi-objectives, were just deployed to all the test samples of FPMA 1 /FMPA 2 (15 each) to exhibit self-x properties and to recover from manufacturing variations and drift. The variations observed in the performance of the test samples were compensated through reconfiguration for the desired specification.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the data computing and memory industry is to keep and ever accelerate the increase of component density reached in nowadays integrated circuits in future technologies based on ultimate CMOS and new emerging research devices. The worldwide-accepted predictions with these technologies indicate a remarkable reduction of the components quality, because of the manufacturing process complexity and the erratic behavior of devices, causing {{a drop in the}} system reliability if we maintain the same design rules than today. Together with the introduction of new devices, new architectural design paradigms have to be included. Fault tolerant techniques are considered necessary and relevant in this scenario. In this paper we present a Fault-Tolerant Nanoscale architecture based on the implementation of logic systems with averaging cells linear threshold gates (AC-LTG). The sensitivity of the gates in relation with <b>manufacturing</b> and environment <b>deviation</b> is investigated and compared with the well known NAND multiplexing concept, showing that the AC-LTG is a valuable alternative in specific nanoscale conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of compositional and statistical analyses of Iron Age ironworking residues from sites in Scotland, England, Wales and France. As no framework for ferrous archaeometallurgy previously existed in the main research area of Scotland, a catalog of sites was compiled to determine where targeted scientific analyses could be of most use in creating a regional metallurgical profile. Fieldwork carried out at the site of Meunet Planches in France provided the non- British research component, as extant analyses matching this study’s temporal criteria were not available. A total of 80 new SEM-EDS samples were generated (58 from Scotland and 22 from France), and used together with existing site- and regional-level compositional studies to explore chemical behavior following the procedures laid out by Charlton (2007) and others. These included a range of multivariate statistical techniques such as Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Discriminant Analysis (DA). These approaches were considered within the wider discussion of smelting “systems” as defined by Dillmann and L’Heritier (2007), in an effort to visualize the relationship between compositional groups and parent geographic regions. Results indicate overall chemical homogeneity within and between the study regions, suggesting that the systems producing the slag were broadly similar in terms of their operation and reduction “efficiency”. This trend remains stable even when accounting for resource-based influence; implying that appreciable similarities existed between system operations (and therefore potentially human decisions) regardless of the size, age, or complexity of <b>manufacturing</b> industries. <b>Deviation</b> from this main compositional group, exhibited by only a handful of sites, seems to be similarly unrelated to temporal or geographic factors. Rather, it appears to follow the diffusion of slag between the two slag Optima identified by Rehren et al (2007), and on several of the outlier sites relates to the production of hypereutectoid steel...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{modeling}} of cost of manufacturing is essential both for estimating {{cost of a}} product and for optimizing alternate manufacturing strategies. Although there are many factors that affect cost of manufacturing, {{the single most important}} parameter for estimating the cost of <b>manufacturing</b> is tolerance (<b>deviation</b> from the nominal size). Since tolerance affects the manufacturing cost directly, in the past most cost formulations were constructed using some form of inverse power function of a single tolerance parameter. However, to meet stringent quality and functional requirements more parts are now being controlled with geometric tolerances on top of size tolerances. In these situations, {{it is very difficult to}} establish a single representative tolerance parameter that can be used for estimating cost of manufacturing. A more general formulation is needed to extend the cost functions to deviations of all features of a part and the mating relations between parts of an assembly so that the total effect of the prescribed geometric tolerances could be captured. In this paper, existing single parameter cost formulations have been reviewed and then a generic deviation-based cot of manufacturing formulation has been presented. The constraints and advantages of extending the cost functions to multi-dimensional formulations have also been briefly discussed...|$|R
