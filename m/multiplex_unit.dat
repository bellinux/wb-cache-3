In this paper, we present the design and test results of a single channel 16 : 1 serializer and {{the design of a}} double-channel 16 : 1 serializer. Both designs are based on a commercial 0. 25 μm silicon-on-sapphire CMOS technology. The single channel serializer consists of a serializing unit, a PLL clock generator and a line driver implemented in current mode logic (CML). The serializing <b>unit</b> <b>multiplexes</b> 16 bit parallel LVDS data into 1 -bit width serial CMOS data. The serializing unit is composed of a cascade of 2 : 1 multiplexing circuits based on static D-flip-flops. The total jitter is measured to be 62 ps at bit error rate (BER) of 10 ^- 12 at 5 Gbps. Random and deterministic jitters are measured to be 2. 6 ps and 33. 4 ps, respectively. The serializer can work from 4. 0 to 5. 7 Gbps with BER less than 10 ^- 12.

We present a High-Power Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (HP-DWDM) with an average channel spacing of 1. 7 (1. 5) nm and a subsequent external cavity mirror to provide feedback for frequency stabilization and multiplexing in one step. The "self-optimizing" <b>multiplexing</b> <b>unit</b> consists of four reflective Volume Bragg Gratings (VBGs) with 99 % diffraction efficiency and seven dielectric mirrors to overlay the radiation of five input channels with an adjustable channel spacing of 1 - 2 nm.

Thereby the angular intensity distribution is more affected than the width of the beam waist. The spectral width per emitter decreases to 3 - 200 pm (FWHM) depending on the injection current and the reflectance of the feedback mirror (0. 75 %, 1. 5 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8 %).

40|$|Compared to {{solid state}} and gas laser sources {{the field of}} {{application}} of high-power diode lasers with comparable output power {{is limited by the}} smaller radiance and (spectral) brilliance. Therefore, the objective of current research activities is to develop wavelength-stabilized diode laser sources. These laser sources can be used for pumping laser-active media with narrow absorption band and in addition to increase the efficiency of state-of-the-art solid state laser systems. Furthermore, the incoherent multiplexing of wavelength-stabilized narrow-band pump sources with a center wavelength spacing < 3 nm called Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) enables the increase of the radiance by two orders of magnitude compared to diode laser systems without spectral multiplexing. Wavelength-stabilization as well as the DWDM-technology can be technically implemented by Volume-Bragg-Gratings (VBG). This dissertation covers the manufacture of VBGs and moreover the demonstration of efficient wavelength-stabilization and efficient dense spectral power scaling. The key objective is the improvement of the radiance or the brilliance of high-power diode laser systems by increasing the spectral channel density from about 0. 02 /nm to the range of 1 /nm. The successfully demonstrated manufacturing method of VBGs, which has been tested under laboratory conditions, bases upon the exposure of photo-thermo-refractive Glasses to UV laser-radiation. The maximum diffraction efficiency of a VBG with a thickness of 1 mm has been determined to 35 %. The transmittance of the substrate measured at a wavelength of 1 µm decreases about < 3 % according to the achieved diffraction efficiency. The VBGs are characterized in a test setup which contains a six-axis piezo-electronic manipulator and measuring beam lines including photo-diodes. Specifically, the measurements of the homogeneity, spectral selectivity, angular selectivity and transmission losses are performed using different optics and beam sources depending on the required measuring accuracy. Based on the mathematical description of the diffraction of plane waves in periodically modulated dielectrics by Herwig Kogelnik and T. K. Gaylord the coupled-wave-theory is extended in order to calculate the transmitted and the diffracted field distributions. Accordingly, the developed model theory considers the polarization-dependent diffraction of arbitrary transversal field distributions, boundary surface effects of the VBG substrate and wave-optical propagation. Moreover, multimode external cavity lasers are designed using a wave-optical 2. 5 D-simulation tool for edge emitting semiconductor lasers. The multi-frequency approach numerically calculates the locally resolved spatial carrier density, the temperature and electrical field amplitude inside the semiconductor material and in the external optical system. At least a partial wavelength-stabilization of the multimode diode laser sources is obtained with three different types of external cavities: (1) biaxial divergent feedback, (2) uniaxial divergent feedback, (3) inverse self-imaging feedback and (d) self-imaging feedback. Finally, the spectral width of a wavelength-stabilized passively cooled diode laser bar with 19 emitters has been experimentally determined to 120 pm (95 % power inclusion). The power losses due to the self-imaging and inverse self-imaging external resonators is < 5 %. On the basis of the theoretical studies Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing of high-power diode laser radiation is experimentally demonstrated with a spectral channel spacing of 1. 5 nm. The total optical efficiency of the compact <b>multiplexing</b> <b>unit</b> is 97 % ± 2 % if transversal single-mode laser radiation with a frequency bandwidth < 5 MHz enters the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>unit.</b> Overlaying the wavelength-stabilized multimode radiation of five passively cooled diode laser bars with a beam propagation factor of M²= 45, the efficiency decreases to 85 % ± 3 %. Thereby, the spectral width of the beam sources amounts < 120 pm within the overall operating range. Within the temperature range of ± 10 K around the chosen operation temperature the multiplexing efficiency drops about < 3 % due to thermally induced changes of the Bragg-wavelengths. Larger deviations can be compensated by actively temperature control. In summary, the use of VBG in the field of high-power diode lasers provides great potential for spectral stabilization and multiplexing...|$|R

The sensors are being tested at White Sands Testing Facility (WSTF) where {{the results will be}} correlated with a known nondestructive technique acoustic emission. The gages will be produced utilizing Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) and/or MWM array eddy current technology. The ultimate goal is to utilize this technology for the health monitoring of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels for all future flight programs. The first full-scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in June 2012. The goals of this test were to determine adaptations of the magnetic stress gauge instrumentation that would be necessary to allow multiple sensors to monitor the vessel's condition simultaneously and to determine how the sensor response changes with sensor selection and orientation. The second full scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in August 2012. The goals of this test were to monitor the vessel's condition with multiple sensors simultaneously, to determine the viability of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>units</b> (MUX) for the application, and to determine if the sensor responses in different orientations are repeatable. For both sets of tests the vessel was pressured up to 6, 000 psi to simulate maximum operating pressure. Acoustic events were observed during the first pressurization cycle. This suggested that the extended storage period prior to use of this bottle led to a relaxation of the residual stresses imparted during auto-frettage. The pressurization tests successfully demonstrated the use of multiplexers with multiple MWM arrays to monitor a vessel. It was discovered that depending upon the sensor orientation, the frequencies, and the sense element, the MWM arrays can provide a variety of complementary information about the composite overwrapped pressure vessel load conditions. For example, low frequency measurements can be used to monitor the overwrap thickness and changes associated with pressure level. High frequency data is dominated by the properties of the overwrap, including the fiber orientations and lay-up of the layers...|$|R

Using simulations, it is shown therein that even with <b>unit</b> <b>multiplexing</b> gain the throughput performance is increased compared to a frequency reuse scheme, especially for the cluster-centre UTs.

Furthermore, the concept of decomposable channel is employed to enable a modified scheme called subspace IA, which is able to simultaneously align interference towards multiple non-intended receivers over a multidimensional space.
