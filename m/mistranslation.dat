5|$|Sheng Long is a {{character}} hoax related to the Street Fighter series, created by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) as an April Fools' prank in 1992 (in an issue published mid-February). The joke, based upon a <b>mistranslation</b> that suggested the existence of {{a character}} named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II, described a method to fight the character in the game. After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity, the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide. As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game's development, EGM revisited the joke in 1997, printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of <b>mistranslation</b> fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

He argues that the <b>mistranslations</b> are the result of French Orientalists projecting racist and colonialist views of the 19th century into their translations of medieval Arabic writings.

Criticism has also focused on their rejection of blood transfusions, particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of sexual abuse to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.|$|E
25|$|The Legend of the Condor Heroes is a wuxia {{novel by}} Jin Yong (Louis Cha). It {{is the first}} part of the Condor Trilogy and is {{followed}} by The Return of the Condor Heroes and The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. It was first serialised between 1 January 1957 and 19 May 1959 in Hong Kong Commercial Daily. Jin Yong revised the novel twice, first in the 1970s and later in the 2000s. The English title is a <b>mistranslation</b> since both species of the condor, the Andean condor and Californian condor, are not native to China. A more accurate translation is Story of the Eagle Shooting Hero.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision {{of males}} was the normal practice, {{as stated by}} Herodotus in his Histories. Though its {{performance}} as a procedure was rarely mentioned, the uncircumcised nature of other cultures was frequently noted, the uncircumcised nature of the Liberians was frequently referenced and military campaigns brought back uncircumcised phalli as trophies, which suggests novelty. However, other records describe initiates into the religious orders as involving circumcision which would imply that the practice was special and not widespread. The only known depiction of the procedure, in The Tomb of the Physician, burial place of Ankh-Mahor at Saqqara, shows adolescents or adults, not babies. Female circumcision may have been practiced, although the single reference to it in ancient texts may be a <b>mistranslation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some anglophone sources wrongly list a race {{called the}} Pau Grand Prix in 1901.

The name of the 1901 event was the Circuit du Sud-Ouest and it was run in three classes around the streets of Pau. The Grand Prix du Palais d'Hiver {{was the name of}} the prizes awarded for the lesser classes ('Light cars' and 'Voiturettes').

25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{argue that}} the prohibition against Suns' marrying Suns was largely a matter of incest taboo. In the early 18th century, all the Suns of a given generation {{appear to have been}} related within three degrees of consanguinity (siblings, first cousins, and second cousins). The custom of Suns' marrying commoners rather than Nobles may have been a preference rather than a requirement. Finally, while Swanton's interpretation claims that Nobles were also required to marry commoners, later researchers have questioned this idea. They have noted in particular a <b>mistranslation</b> of the primary sources and a misreading by Swanton. In other words, it could be that only Suns were required to marry exogamously, and this requirement may have been mainly a result of the taboo against incest.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{etymology}} of {{the name}} can be disputed, {{there are only a}} few theories about where the word might have derived from. The origins of the music are traced to the land of Cibao, and Merengue Cibaeño and Merengue Típico are the terms most musicians use to refer to Classical Merengue. The word Cibao was a native name for the island, although the Spanish used it in their conquest to refer to a specific part of the island, the highest mountainous range. Literally speaking, the term Merengue Cibaeño is therefore partially native and so Merengue might also be a derivation or <b>mistranslation</b> of a native word related to song, music, dance or festival. Another theory includes Western African words related to dance and music, based on the fact that Merengue has African elements in it.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} {{differences between the}} original manuscripts and Mathers' edition. First, {{one of the four}} books was missing entirely from the French manuscript with which he worked. Second, Mathers gave the duration of the operation as six months, whereas all other sources specify eighteen months. Third, possibly due to a <b>mistranslation,</b> Mathers changed one of the ingredients within the recipe for Abramelin oil, specifying galangal instead of the original herb calamus. The oil in the German manuscript sources also contains cassia and is nearly identical to the biblical recipe for Holy anointing oil. The differences between the recipes cause several notable changes in the oil's characteristics, including edibility, fragrance, dermal sensation, and spiritual symbolism. Fourth, there are 242 word squares in Mathers' translation, while the original German has 251. Most of the squares in Mathers are not completely filled in, and those that are differ markedly from the German sources.|$|E
25|$|Bangladeshi {{authorities}} {{claim that}} as many as 3 million people were killed, although the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, the official Pakistani government investigation, put the figure as low as 26,000 civilian casualties. The figure of 3 million has become embedded in Bangladeshi culture and literature. The 'million' figure is attributed to the vernacular 'lakh' becoming mistranslated in Western media, thus increasing the casualty figure ten-fold. Serajur Rahman, the Deputy Head of the BBC Bengal service, attributes this <b>mistranslation</b> to a verbal gaffe by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Heathrow Airport; Sayyid A. Karim, Bangladesh’s first foreign secretary alleges that the source of the figure was Pravda, the news-arm of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Independent researchers have estimated the death toll to be around 300,000 to 500,000 people while others estimate the casualty figure to be 3 million. The United States intelligence agency, the CIA and the State Department estimated that 200,000 people had been killed in the genocide.|$|E
25|$|With the {{simultaneous}} technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many {{often had to}} be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of <b>mistranslation</b> and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents {{that could not be}} kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents {{in front of them and}} were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to do an interpretation properly. Also, a number of interpreters were noted for protesting the idea of using vulgar language reflected in the proceeds, especially if it referenced Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.|$|E
