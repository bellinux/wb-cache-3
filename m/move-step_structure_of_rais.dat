There are two corpora consist of fifteen MA theses written by American native and fifteen others by Iraqi Arab non-native speakers of English. Based on the analysis, some similarities and differences were found regarding cyclicity (move <b>structure)</b> and <b>move-step</b> frequency <b>of</b> occurrence. The findings of the present study are useful for Iraqi non-native writers by presenting the important factors that make them familiar with rhetorical <b>move-step</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> MA thesis abstracts...|$|R
40|$|Results and Discussion {{chapters}} {{are considered}} difficult {{to write in}} a thesis, especially for non-native English writers. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted on how writers compose these two genres. This study, therefore, explores the <b>move-step</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> these two chapters in 24 Master’s theses written by Vietnamese postgraduates. Based on the framework by Chen and Kuo (2012) and the discourse-based interviews with actual thesis writers and supervisors, the study found that this group of writers constructed the genres according to their perceived communicative purposes of these chapters. Moreover, the presence of section/chapter introduction-next section/chapter introduction-section/chapter summary cycles tends to reflect the distinctive composition of these texts at the TESOL discourse community in Vietnam. These findings suggest that explicit instructions on rhetorical <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> these two genres should be provided to non-native English writers and attention should also be paid to specific practice of a genre composition in a particular discourse community...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>move-step</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> Japanese and English {{introductory}} chapters of literature Ph. D. theses {{and perceptions of}} Ph. D. supervisors in the Japanese and UK higher education contexts. In this study, 51 Japanese and 48 English introductory chapters of literature Ph. D. theses written by first language writers of Japanese or English were collected from three Japanese and three British universities. Genre analysis of 99 introductory chapters was conducted using a revised “Create a Research Space” (CARS) model (Swales, 1990, 2004). Semi-structured interviews were also carried out with seven Japanese supervisors and ten British supervisors. The findings showed that the introductory chapters of literature Ph. D. theses had 13 move-specific steps and five move-independent steps, each of which presented different cyclical patterns, indicating cross-cultural {{similarities and differences between}} the two language groups. The perceptions of supervisors varied in terms of the importance and the sequence of individual steps in the introductory chapters. Based on the textual and interview analyses, a discipline-oriented Open-CARS model is proposed for pedagogical purposes of teaching and writing about this genre in Japanese or English in the field of literature and related fields...|$|R
