40|$|Chloroform (CHCl 3) is {{reasonably}} anticipated to {{be a human}} carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (NCI 1976, IARC 1972, 1979, 1982, 1987, 1999). When administered by gavage (in corn oil), the compound induced hepatocellular carcinomas in mice of both sexes. It also induced increased incidences of kidney epithelial tumors in male rats when administered by the same route (NCI 1976). When administered orally (in olive oil), chloroform induced hepatomas and cirrhosis in female mice (IARC 1979). Chloroform in toothpaste or arachis oil, administered to four strains of mice by gavage, induced kidney epithelial tumors in males of one strain (Roe et al. 1979). When administered orally in drinking water, chloroform induced increased incidences of renal tubular cell adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas in male rats, but no renal or hepatic tumors were induced in male or female mice (Jorgenson et al. 1985). Another recent study reported the development of hepatic adenofibrosis in rats of both sexes and neoplastic nodules in females when chloroform was administered in the drinking water (Tumasonis et al. 1987). There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of chloroform in humans (IARC 1982, 1987, 1999). Several epidemiological and ecological studies indicate that there is an association between cancer of the large intestine, rectum, and/or urinary bladder and the constituents of chlorinated water (EPA 1985). Although data may suggest a possible increased risk of cancer from exposure to chloroform in chlorinated drinking water, the data were insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of chloroform. Properties Chloroform is a colorless, volatile liquid that is nonflammable. It is slightly soluble in water and is <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> oils, <b>ethanol,</b> ether, and other organic solvents. Chloroform has a pleasant, nonirritating odor. It is unstable when exposed to air, light, and/or heat, which cause it to break down to phosgene, hydrochloric acid, and chlorine. It is usually stabilized by the addition of 0. 5 % to 1 % ethanol. When heated to decomposition, chloroform emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds (WHO 1994, HSDB 2001) ...|$|R
50|$|Anacardic acids are {{phenolic}} lipids, {{chemical compounds}} {{found in the}} shell of the cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale). An acid form of urushiol, they also cause an allergic skin rash on contact, known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. Anacardic acid is a yellow liquid. It is partially <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> <b>ethanol</b> and ether, but nearly immiscible with water. Chemically, anacardic acid {{is a mixture of}} several closely related organic compounds. Each consists of a salicylic acid substituted with an alkyl chain that has 15 or 17 carbon atoms. The alkyl group may be saturated or unsaturated; anacardic acid is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated molecules. The exact mixture depends on the species of the plant. The 15 carbon unsaturated side chain compound found in the cashew plant is lethal to Gram positive bacteria.|$|E
40|$|Synthesis, properties, and {{potential}} applications in ceramic processing for two polysiloxane silica precursors {{derived from the}} controlled hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) are presented. The higher molecular weight TEOS-A is a thick adhesive liquid of viscosity 8000 to 12, 000 c. p. having a SiO 2 char yield of about 55 percent. The lower molecular weight TEOS-B is a more fluid liquid of viscosity 150 to 200 c. p. having a SiO 2 char yield of about 52 percent. The acid catalyzed hydrolysis of TEOS to hydrated silica gel goes {{through a series of}} polysiloxane intermediates. The rate of this transition increases with the quantity of water added to the TEOS; thus, for ease of polymer isolation, the amount of water added must be carefully determined so as to produce the desired polymer in a reasonable time. The water to TEOS mole ratio falls in the narrow range of 1. 05 for TEOS-A and 0. 99 for TEOS-B. Further polymerization or gelation is prevented by storing at - 5 C in a freezer. Both polysiloxanes thermoset to a glassy solid at 115 C. The liquid polymers are organic in nature in that they are <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> toluene and <b>ethanol,</b> slightly souble in heptane, but immiscible with water. For both polymers, results on viscosity versus time are given at several temperatures and water additions. Based on these results, some examples of practical utilization of the precursors for ceramic fabrication are given...|$|R

50|$|In organic compounds, {{the weight}} percent of {{hydrocarbon}} chain often determines the compound's miscibility with water. For example, among the alcohols, ethanol has two carbon atoms and is <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> water, whereas 1-octanol with eight carbons is not. Octanol's immiscibility leads {{it to be}} used as a standard for partition equilibria. This is also the case with lipids; the very long carbon chains of lipids cause them almost always to be immiscible with water. Analogous situations occur for other functional groups. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> water, whereas valeric acid (C4H9COOH) is not. Simple aldehydes and ketones tend to be <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> water, because a hydrogen bond can form between the hydrogen atom of a water molecule and the unbonded (lone) pair of electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom.|$|R

On the other hand, water and most oils are immiscible usually forming layers according to increasing density from the top. This can be predicted {{by comparing the}} polarity. Water being a relatively polar compound will tend to be <b>miscible</b> <b>with</b> liquids of high polarity such as ethanol and acetone, whereas compounds with low polarity will tend to be immiscible and poorly soluble such as with hydrocarbons.|$|R
