5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of weights and <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the British Empire. The {{effect of this}} act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the part of both town and gown.|$|E

It further supports widespread use of referenda, promoting English devolution and abolishing the National Assembly for Wales.

5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no tax increases, and relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> social issues such as abortion be dropped from the budget, 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped, and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These <b>measures,</b> <b>on</b> top of the low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats {{and had to be}} placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E

He became District Engineer of the Binghamton District on 25 May 1940, with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States from 12 June 1941. On 31 January 1942, he became District Engineer of the Syracuse District, which covered New York and part of Pennsylvania, with the rank of colonel from 1 February 1942. At Binghamton and Syracuse was responsible for a number of major projects, including ammunition and explosive plants, and the construction of the Rome Air Depot.

DE1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE1 was co-signed with DE14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE14 was truncated at Milford. The DE1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway.|$|E
