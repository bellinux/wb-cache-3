40|$|This study {{examines}} the interconnections between domestic regulatory reform and <b>market</b> <b>openness</b> by drawing on OECD’s earlier {{work on the}} regulatory aspects of trade. Part 1 considers how domestic regulations and regulatory reform affect <b>market</b> <b>openness.</b> It shows how {{with the help of}} advanced regulatory reform tools and approaches governments can create regulations and regulatory procedures that efficiently meet their policy objectives {{while at the same time}} supporting market access. Part 2 demonstrates that international market opening can contribute to facilitating domestic regulatory reform. Trade agreements signed on the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels can promote general principles or specific elements of good regulation and help guide or drive countries' individual regulatory reform efforts. Finally, part 3 analyzes the mutual benefits of regulatory reform and an open multilateral system for trade and investment. It is argued that by increasing domestic economic efficiency, raising the international competitiveness of domestic enterprises and reducing barriers to trade and investment, traderelated regulatory reform enables countries to take better advantage of trade liberalization and of open global markets. regulatory reforms, domestic regulation, <b>market</b> <b>openness,</b> regionalism...|$|R

In addition market developments are raising a number of issues which are likely to become relevant in the event that there are further discussions on market opening in the context of any future WTO service negotiations. As a paper aimed at beginning discussion and reflection, a number of questions are raised which could be used by delegations to provide their own assessment of issues and future problem areas which need consideration. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the reasons behind}} the {{evolution}} of the gender gap and wage inequality in South and East Asian and Latin American countries. Health human capital improvements, the exposure to free <b>market</b> <b>openness</b> and equal treatment enforcement laws seem to be the main exogenous variables affecting women’s economic condition. During the second globalization era (in the years 1975 - 2000) different combinations of these variables in South East Asian and Latin American countries have had as a result the diminution of the gender gap. The main exception to this rule according to our data is China where economic reforms have been simultaneous to the increase of gender differences and inequality between men and women. This result has further normative consequences for the measure of economic inequality. The improvement of women’s condition has as a result the diminution of the dispersion of wages. Therefore in most of the countries analysed the consequence of the diminution of the gender gapduring the second global era is the decrease of wage inequality both measured with Gini and Theil indexes.

40|$|Globalization and the {{integration}} of national economies into the international economic system remains a contested area of policy. The OECD has just released a study titled "Open Markets Matter: The Benefits of Trade and Investment Liberalisation " (OECD, 1998 a) which extols the benefits of openness. While trade and foreign direct investment can undoubtedly generate benefits, the extent of these benefits {{and the manner in}} which they are distributed depends critically on the institutional context in which liberalization occurs. It is the design of this institutional context that is missing from the current debate, and it is the absence of this feature that underlies many of the existing policy disagreements. Trade and investment liberalization result in a reconfiguration of production and changed patterns of competition amongst countries. By changing the set of economic options available to business, increased <b>market</b> <b>openness</b> changes the pattern of relations amongst business, labor and government. These changes can be positive sum with all benefitting, zero sum with benefits to one group coming at the expense of another, or negative sum with all losing.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} work {{under way to}} analyse the composition of public spending in response to increased economic openness in the advanced industrial societies over recent decades. The compensation hypothesis predicts that public spending will rise in response to greater openness, especially trade competition. The globalization hypothesis predicts that public spending will be constrained by increased capital <b>market</b> <b>openness.</b> Our research design distinguishes between four aspects of public spending. First it considers spending targeted at producer as opposed to labour market interests. It further distinguishes between short-term transfer spending and longer-term investment spending, {{all of which have}} aspects of compensation spending to them. The principal focus of the research project is to analyse to what degree left-right partisanship makes a difference to spending effort, and to what degree the patterns vary between different varieties of capitalism. Drawing mainly on OECD data for the period since 1980, the modelling and analysis, using pooled time-series cross-sectional data with an error correction model, is as yet at a relatively early stage. Preliminary results suggest that neither trade nor capital <b>market</b> <b>openness</b> is associated with increase spending efforts in the manner anticipated by the compensation hypothesis.

The proposed bidding policy considers the optimal control policy to <b>maximize</b> <b>market</b> profits while satisfying the market performance requirement through a chance-constraint.

40|$|AbstractForeign direct {{investment}} {{continues to expand}} rapidly, enlarging the role of international production in the world economy. This expansion in business activity reflects trade and investment liberalization in many countries. The location decisions on FDI depend on a country's broader set of factors such as <b>market</b> <b>openness</b> and deregulation, competition regimes, development policies and intellectual property rights, that influence not only international foreign {{direct investment}}, trade but also the transfer of technology. Patents are one form of the exclusive intellectual property rights conferred by the state {{in order to promote}} science and technology. International technology transfer comes through three channels, FDI, joint ventures and licenses. The increase of international technological diffusion has enhanced the importance of intellectual property rights and particularly of patents. This paper aims at providing evidence linking the patent protection to technology transfer and inward foreign direct investment in different industry sectors in Greece. Strengthening Greece's IPR regime is seen as a prerequisite for the attraction of foreign multinationals to transfer technology, increasing the growth and the innovative activity. It also examines the role of other factors in attracting more FDI as the <b>market</b> <b>openness,</b> country risks and so on. A proper understanding of the above relationship will help firms and government to create appropriate intellectual property policy in order to encourage the growth and expansion of FDI in Greece...|$|R
