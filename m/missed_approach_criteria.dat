40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to determine IFR approach path and touchdown dispersions for manual and automatic XV- 15 tilt rotor landings, and to develop <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> <b>criteria.</b> Only helicopter mode XV- 15 operation is considered. The analysis and design sections develop the automatic and flight director guidance equations for decelerating curved and straight-in approaches into a typical VTOL landing site equipped with an MLS navigation aid. These system designs satisfy all known pilot-centered, guidance and control requirements for this flying task. Performance data, obtained from nonstationary covariance propagation dispersion analysis for the system, are used to develop the approach monitoring criteria. The autoland and flight director guidance equations are programmed for the VSTOLAND 1819 B digital computer. The system design dispersion data developed through analysis and the 1819 B digital computer program are verified and refined using the fixed-base, man-in-the-loop XV- 15 VSTOLAND simulation...|$|E
50|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>approach</b> point (MAP or MAPt) is {{the point}} {{prescribed}} in each instrument approach at which a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure shall be executed if the required visual reference does not exist. It defines the point for both precision and non-precision <b>approaches</b> wherein the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> segment of an approach procedure begins. A pilot must execute a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> if a required visual reference (normally the runway or its environment) is not in sight upon reaching the MAP or the pilot decides it is unsafe {{to continue with the}} approach and landing to the runway. The <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point is published in the approach plates and contains instructions for <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedures to be executed at this point.|$|R
50|$|The <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> {{procedure}} normally {{includes an}} initial heading or track to follow, and altitude to climb to, typically followed by holding instructions {{at a nearby}} navigation fix. The pilot is expected to inform ATC by radio of the initiation of the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> as soon as possible. ATC may simply acknowledge the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> call or modify the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> instructions, for example, with vectors to another fix. ATC may subsequently clear the flight for another approach at the same airport or clear it to an alternative airport, depending on the pilot's intentions as well as fuel, weather and traffic considerations.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, if a pilot determines by {{the time}} the {{aircraft}} is at the decision height (for a precision <b>approach)</b> or <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point (for a non-precision approach), that the runway or its environment is not in sight, or that a safe landing cannot be accomplished for any reason, the landing approach must be discontinued (a [...] "go-around") and the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure must be immediately initiated. It is also common for pilots to practice a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> as part of initial or recurrent instrument training. In such cases, a pilot may execute multiple instrument approaches in a row, with <b>missed</b> <b>approaches</b> between them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>approach</b> is a {{procedure}} {{followed by a}} pilot when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing. The instructions for the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> may be assigned by air traffic control (ATC) prior to the clearance for the approach. If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the <b>approach</b> and a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> is executed, the pilot must follow the (default) <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure specified for the approach. Prior to commencing the approach, if the pilot believes that a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> may occur, {{he or she can}} make a specific request to ATC in the event that one occurs. Such a request may include heading and altitude instructions to avoid in-flight delays (such as holds) and efficiently maneuver the aircraft into position for either its next approach or a diversion to an alternate airport.|$|R
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point (MAP), then initiate a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the <b>missed</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 5 January 1989, a Federal Express Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster (registration N945FE) {{executed}} a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> {{but failed to}} do so in accordance with published <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedures, resulting in a collision with trees. The pilot, the only occupant, was uninjured.|$|R
5000|$|Manx2 Flight 7100 - Also {{crashed in}} fog after <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash, {{according}} to the NTSB, was improper IFR (Instrument flight rules) operation, failure to adhere to instrument approach procedures. The airplane collided with a mountain on a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> to landing, after multiple <b>missed</b> <b>approaches.</b> The weather at the airport was below approach minima with a low ceiling and sea fog.|$|R
50|$|When {{conducting}} an RNP AR <b>approach</b> with a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> less than RNP 1.0, no single-point-of-failure {{can cause the}} loss of guidance compliant with the RNP value associated with a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure. Typically, the aircraft must have at least dual GNSS sensors, dual flight management systems, dual air data systems, dual autopilots, and a single inertial reference unit.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{official}} investigation report, released on 28 November 2014, the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew's failure to properly execute the published <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft impacting terrain. A sudden change of weather conditions and an improperly executed published instrument approach necessitated the go-around. [...] The recordings show that the flight crew initiated a right turn according to the lateral <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> trajectory without succeeding in reaching the vertical trajectory. Specifically, the flight crew didn't follow the vertical profile of <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> as the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> altitude was set at 600 ft and the aircraft system went into altitude capture mode. When the flight crew realized that the altitude was too close to the ground, the PF over-reacted, which led to a high pitch attitude of 33Â°. It then impacted trees. The fuselage struck the bank and plunged into the river.|$|R

50|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found that the visual flight in weather conditions below minimums. Flight 150 was in a downwind leg as the aircraft was on approach to the airport in fog. It is unknown why the air traffic controller {{did not tell the}} pilots of flight 150 to execute a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> or why the pilots themselves didn't execute a <b>missed</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|R

50|$|ICAO defines {{decision}} altitude/decision height as {{a specified}} altitude or height (A/H) in the precision approach {{at which a}} <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. A decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA) is a specified lowest height or altitude in the approach descent at which, if the required visual reference to continue the approach (such as the runway markings or runway environment) is not visible to the pilot, the pilot must initiate a <b>missed</b> <b>approach.</b> The specific values for DH and/or DA at a given airport are established with intention to allow a pilot sufficient time to safely re-configure an aircraft to climb and execute the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedures while avoiding terrain and obstacles. A DH/DA denotes the altitude in which a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure must be started, it does not preclude the aircraft from dipping below the prescribed DH/DA. A decision height is measured AGL (above ground level) while a decision altitude is measured above MSL (mean sea level). They are used for precision approaches.|$|R

50|$|The crash site, on a 2,300 ft hill, was 1.6 mi {{northeast}} {{of where the}} aircraft should {{have been on the}} inbound course to the NDB. The published NDB approach brings the inbound aircraft down a valley, and has a minimum descent height of 2,150 ft at the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point (where they should have climbed and turned to the right if the runway was not in view), which is below the elevation of the hills to the north. The runway is at 510 ft MSL. Five other aircraft had landed prior to the CT-43A and had not experienced any problems with the navigational aids. There was no emergency call from the pilots, and they did not initiate a <b>missed</b> <b>approach,</b> even though they were beyond the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point when they hit the hill at 2:57 PM local time.|$|R

50|$|A {{middle marker}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to 0.8 nmi km before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the middle marker, the receiver's amber middle marker light starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|R
