Hermann Schoemann hosted Adolf Hitler and his retinue for a short cruise from Kiel to Eckernförde in July 1938 and participated in the August Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. Korvettenkapitän Theodor Detmers relieved Schulte-Mönting in October.

40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} final {{finishing}} and polishing {{time on the}} microleakage of composites restorations are not yet recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of final finishing and polishing time on microleakage of  hybrid composite restorations. Methods: In this in-vitro study, 40 molar teeth of class 5 cavity(2 mm occlusogingival× 3 mm mesiodistal× 1. 5 mm depth) were prepared at the buccal surface. The cavities were restored via Z 250 composite and cured for 40 seconds by LED Valo. The cavities were randomly divided into 4 groups(n= 10) according to the polishing time(immidiate, polishing 15 minutes, 24 hours and one week after restoration). The teeth were subjected to 500 thermal cycles and submerged in 2 % fuchsin to evaluate rate of microleakage. After <b>monting,</b> the specimens were sectioned in half, that both halves were examined under a stereomicroscope. Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests were applied in order to analyze the study data (&alpha= 0. 05). Results: Polishing time did not produce any effects on the microleakage in the dentine margin) Pvalue= 0 / 56) and even enamel margin (Pvalue= 0 / 12). The difference between microleakage rate of dentine margin and enamel margin  was not demonstrated to be significant in regard with polishing immediately (Pvalue= 0 / 26 (and polishing after 15 minutes) Pvalue= 0 / 53), though polishing after 24 hours (Pvalue= 0 / 03) and one week (Pvalue= 0 / 00) was reported to make {{a significant difference between}} the both margins. Moreover, the rate of microleakage was observed less in the enamel margin. Conclusion: The study findings revealed that different polishing time does not have any effect on the microleakage rate of Z 250 restorations in both dentine margin and enamel margin...|$|E
