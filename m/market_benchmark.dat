The returns of ETNs are usually linked {{to the performance of}} a <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> or strategy, less investor fees. When an investor buys an ETN, the underwriting bank promises to pay the amount reflected in the index, minus fees upon maturity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the pricing performance of agricultural market advisory services in hogs. Pricing recommendations are available for all quarters from the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001.

Hence, advisory programs as a group do not outperform the <b>market</b> <b>benchmarks</b> in terms of average price. Advisory programs also do not outperform the <b>market</b> <b>benchmarks</b> in terms of average price and risk.

5000|$|Actually, Verstein argues, {{this data}} {{strongly}} supported a different theory of manipulation. The majors bought up potential hot oil {{that was being}} priced below the market—oil that if included in calculating the benchmark (for example, if bought up {{by one of the}} jobber middlemen whose purchases were included in the benchmark) would have lowered the benchmark and thus lowered the prices the majors received for all of their oil. But the prices that the majors paid for the potential hot oil did not go into the benchmark, and the prices the jobbers would have paid did not go into the benchmark (because the jobbers never bought that oil). [...] "By buying up any oil priced more cheaply than the current benchmark price, the oil companies could support the benchmark price against falling with the market." [...] Since 91% of the potential hot oil that the majors bought was bought below the benchmark price, and the majors disqualified that oil from inclusion in the benchmark by buying it themselves, the dancing-partner program prevented a huge drop in the spot <b>market</b> <b>benchmark.</b> Apparently, the government failed to realize this.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} report is to identify the appropriate <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> price to use to evaluate the pricing performance of market advisory services that {{are included in the}} annual AgMAS pricing performance evaluations. Five desirable properties of <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> prices are identified. Three potential specifications of the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> price are considered: the average price received by Illinois farmers, the harvest cash price, and the average cash price over a two-year crop marketing window. The average cash price meets all of the desired properties, except {{that it would not be}} easily implementable by producers. It can be shown, though, that the price realized via a more manageable strategy of "spreading" sales during the marketing window very closely approximates the average cash price.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{marketing}} performance of wheat farmers in Illinois and Kansas over 1982 – 2004. The results show that farmer benchmark prices for wheat in Illinois and Kansas fall in the middle third of the price range about half to three-quarters of the time. Consistent with previous studies, this refutes the contention that Illinois and Kansas wheat farmers routinely market the bulk of their wheat crop in the bottom portion of the price range. Tests of the average difference between farmer and <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> prices are sensitive to the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> considered. The marketing performance of wheat farmers in Illinois and Kansas is about equal to the market if a 24 - or 20 -month <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> is used, slightly above the market if a 12 -month price benchmark is used, and significantly less than the market if the harvest benchmark is used. The sensitivity of marketing performance to the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> considered is explained by the seasonal pattern of prices. While Illinois producers performed slightly better than their counterparts in Kansas, notable differences in performance across these two geographic areas is not observed. benchmarks, Illinois, Kansas, marketing, performance, price, wheat, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, Marketing, Production Economics, Productivity Analysis, Q 11, Q 13,...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{significant}} proportion of the world’s adult population is insufficiently active. One approach used to overcome barriers and facilitate participation in physical activity is social marketing. The purpose of this paper are twofold: first, this review seeks to provide a contemporary review of social marketing’s effectiveness in changing physical activity for the better; and second, it seeks to ascertain the extent that Andreasen’s (2002) six social <b>marketing</b> <b>benchmark</b> criteria have been applied in social marketing interventions targeting physical activity. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 94 articles covering 26 social marketing interventions were identified following systematic literature review procedures. Findings: None of the interventions gave evidence that they addressed all six social <b>marketing</b> <b>benchmark</b> criteria, and only four interventions addressed five criteria. The results indicate that three of the benchmark criteria, namely, behavioural objectives, formative research, and marketing mix are well utilised in social marketing interventions. Inclusion of market segmentation, exchange and competition offers potential to extend further on social marketing’s effectiveness in increasing physical activity. Originality/value: The results of the current study indicate that increasing the number of benchmark criteria used in an intervention to at least four increases the chances of achieving positive behavioural outcomes.

40|$|Markets {{have long}} been used as {{benchmarks}} for economic value in various areas of law. However, a crucial question has received less than adequate attention: what type of market {{should be used in}} the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark?</b> More specifically, given all the imperfections one typically finds in day-to-day markets, how perfect does a market have to be in order to qualify as a benchmark for economic value? This Article discusses this question using countervailing duty law as a case study. Countervailing duty law allows the United States to impose countervailing duties on imported merchandise to offset subsidies conferred by foreign governments upon such merchandise. In identifying and measuring subsidies, countervailing duty law utilizes a <b>market</b> <b>benchmark,</b> i. e., whether the government action under investigation is on terms more favorable than those available in the market. After tracing the evolution of the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> analysis in countervailing duty law, I demonstrate that the <b>market</b> <b>benchmark</b> analysis, as currently formulated in countervailing duty law, envisions a perfect or near-perfect market, i. e., a market that is undistorted by the government action under investigation. I further demonstrate the pitfalls of this perfect-market approach by critiquing the basis on which a market is rejected as distorted, the manner in which alternative benchmarks are selected, and the fundamental disconnect between the perfect-market approach and the purpose of countervailing duty law...|$|E

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review retrieved a total of 1, 495 identified articles; 565 duplicates were removed. The remaining 930 articles were then screened. Articles detailing formative research or programmes targeting multiple substances, parents, families and/or communities, as well as elementary schools and universities were excluded. A total of 31 articles, encompassing 16 qualifying programmes, were selected for detailed evaluation. Findings The majority of alcohol education programmes were developed on the basis of theory and achieved short- and medium-term behavioural effects. Importantly, most programmes were universal and did not apply the full market segmentation process. Limited audience research in the form of student involvement in programme design was identified.
