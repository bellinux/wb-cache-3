5|$|Prospective colourists at A. Farsari & Co. {{were interviewed}} by Farsari himself, who ensured they were {{familiar}} with Japanese painting techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained {{in a letter to}} his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E

Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767.

Al-Arian went on a 62-day hunger strike to protest the ruling.|$|E

In 1956 Congress adjourned on July 27—marking the last time the Senate adjourned before the first of August.|$|E

25|$|The {{venereal disease}} {{section of the}} U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) formed a study group in 1932 at its {{national}} headquarters. Taliaferro Clark was credited with founding it. His initial goal was to follow untreated syphilis {{in a group of}} black men for 6 to 9 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> follow up with a treatment phase. When he understood the intention of other study members to use deceptive practices, Clark disagreed with the plan to conduct an extended study. He retired the year after the study began.|$|E
25|$|Khalid El-Masri is a German {{citizen who}} was {{detained}} in Skopje, flown to Afghanistan, interrogated and tortured by the CIA for several <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> released in remote Albania in May 2004 without having {{been charged with}} any offense. This was apparently due to a misunderstanding that arose concerning the similarity of the spelling of El-Masri's name with the spelling of suspected terrorist Khalid al-Masri. Germany had issued warrants for 13 people suspected {{to be involved with}} the abduction, but dropped them in September 2007.|$|E

25|$|When {{settlers}} {{arrived from}} Europe, the Tonkawa tribe inhabited the area. The Comanches and Lipan Apaches were also known to {{travel through the}} area. Spanish colonists, including the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition, traveled through the area for centuries, though few permanent settlements were created for some time. In 1730, three missions from East Texas were combined and reestablished as one mission {{on the south side}} of the Colorado River, in what is now Zilker Park, in Austin. The mission was in this area for only about seven <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> was moved to San Antonio de Béxar and split into three missions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{influence}} on U.S. weather is the polar jet stream which migrates northward into Canada {{in the summer}} <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> southward into the USA in the winter months. The jet stream brings in large low pressure systems from the northern Pacific Ocean that enter the US mainland over the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains pick {{up most of the}} moisture from these systems as they move eastward. Greatly diminished by the time they reach the High Plains, much of the moisture has been sapped by the orographic effect as it is forced over several mountain ranges.|$|E
25|$|This setback was {{followed}} {{another in the}} early days of 1935: Keeton was knocked down and seriously injured by a lorry near his home in Mansfield in January, fracturing his ribs and suffering concussion. He was in hospital for three weeks and his doctors were reporting as saying that he was unlikely to be fit for cricket until the end of the 1935 season. In the event, he returned to the Nottinghamshire side in late June, played for less than two <b>months</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> stood down from playing again in mid-August; unsurprisingly, his aggregate and average fell significantly.|$|E
