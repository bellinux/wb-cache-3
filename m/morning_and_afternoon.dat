5|$|The Truman {{family moved}} into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, {{including}} the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked {{to and from}} his work across the street each <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon.</b> In due course, {{the decision was made}} to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon</b> rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The new airport opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 30, 1935, James Charles Taylor had two paper {{routes to}} help his widowed mother make ends meet. He {{delivered}} the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon</b> routes by bicycle for three dollars a week, which helped to develop his leg muscles. Though he did not play football until his junior year, he was a star athlete in four sports at Baton Rouge High School, and graduated in 1954. He stayed in town and played college football at Louisiana State University for coach Paul Dietzel's LSU Tigers football team. Taylor played on LSU's freshman team in 1954, but due to struggles in the classroom, he transferred to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi as a sophomore, where he met his future wife Dixie Grant. He then returned to LSU as a junior.|$|E

5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Italy {{also brought}} with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon.</b> On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew bailing out. One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to {{the vicinity of the}} Dalmatian coast.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals in the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon</b> of transmission. Not every scene was live; {{a significant amount}} of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed {{that would not have been}} possible in an all-live production.|$|E

5|$|The Ekeberg Line {{is served}} by lines 18 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. Line 19 always runs {{the full length of}} the line, while Line 18 does not operate from Ljabru to Holtet during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Line 18 connects via the city center to the Ullevål Hageby Line while Line 19 runs onwards along the Briskeby Line. Travel time from Ljabru to Holtet is 7 minutes, to Oslo Hospital is 14 minutes and to Jernbanetoget is 20 minutes. Both of the lines run every 10 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes during the evenings and part of the {{weekends}} and every 30 minutes during early mornings on weekends. This gives a peak service of every 5 minutes along the Ekeberg Line. The service is provided using high-floor SL79 and low-floor SL95 trams. Because of the lack of a balloon loop at Rikshospitalet, Line 18 must be operated with SL95 units, while SL79 units are used on Line 19 because the Brikeby Line does not have a high enough permitted axle load to for the SL95 units.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon</b> sessions each lasted 90 minutes.

The session was prematurely ended due to the limited time running.|$|E

Bruno Senna's left-side view mirror became detached from his Hispania F110, which grazed the Brazilian driver's helmet, and was run over by Sébastien Buemi heading into turn 12, which caused the session to be stopped to allow marshals to clear the track of debris.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were scheduled to run before the Sunday race. The Friday <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>afternoon</b> sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning.

Timo Bernhard in the No. 1 Porsche led the practice session in its final minutes with a lap time of one minute and 42.182 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than Marc Lieb in the sister entry. LMP2 was led by René Rast in G-Drive Racing's No. 26 Oreca 05 Nissan with a fastest timed lap of one minute and 51.617 seconds set in the session's final 15 minutes.
