Water-craft must have an inventory of hazardous material before they are scrapped, and the facilities must meet health & safety requirements. The International Labour Organization created a voluntary set of guidelines for occupational safety in 2003. Nevertheless, Greenpeace found that even pre-existing <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> has had little noticeable effect for labourers, due to government corruption, yard owner secrecy {{and a lack of}} interest from countries who prioritise economic growth. To safeguard worker health, the report recommends that developed countries create a fund to support their families, certify carriers as 'gas-free' (i.e. safe for cutting) and to remove toxic materials in appropriate facilities before export. To supplement the international treaties, organisations such as the NGO Shipbreaking Platform, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights and ToxicsWatch Alliance are lobbying for improvements in the industry.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} developing agri-environmental policy measures in Israel, focusing on market-oriented instruments. A conceptual framework for developing agri-environmental policy measures is presented, first in very broad lines (<b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations,</b> economic instruments and advisory measures) and subsequently focusing on economic instruments, and specifically, on market-oriented ones. Two criteria of choice between the measures are suggested: their contribution to improving {{the effectiveness of the}} policy; and the feasibility of their implementation. This is the framework used for analyzing agri-environmental measures in Israel. Israel currently implements a mix of <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations,</b> economic instruments and advisory measures to promote the agri-environment. The use of additional economic instruments may improve the effectiveness of the policy. When comparing the effectiveness of various economic measures, we found that the feasibility of implementation of market-oriented instruments is greater, due to the Israeli public’s preference for strengthening market orientation in the agricultural sector. Four market-oriented instruments were practiced in a pilot project conducted in an Israeli rural area. We found that in this case study, the institutional feasibility and acceptance by stakeholders were the major parameters influencing the implementation of the market-oriented instruments, whereas the instruments’ contribution to enhancing the ecological o...|$|R

5000|$|England, Europe and Australasia - A Holy Royal Arch Chapter is {{required}} to be sponsored by a Craft Lodge and bears the same number (and in almost all cases the same name); however, the HRA is a separate Order from Craft Freemasonry. Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter is governed from {{the headquarters of the}} United Grand Lodge of England, but the administration remains distinct - though many officers of the Grand Lodge hold the equivalent office in the Grand Chapter. In these countries the Order of the Royal Arch consists of a single 'Royal Arch' degree, although there are three related ceremonies, one for the installation into each of the three Principals' chairs. As a compromise, at the union of two rival Grand Lodges in 1813 (one of which considered the Royal Arch a 'Fourth Degree', whilst the other almost totally ignored it) English Freemasonry recognised the Royal Arch as part of [...] "pure, ancient masonry", but stated that it was not an additional degree, but merely the [...] "completion of the third degree". However, this was merely a compromise position, and one which was in opposition to normal masonic practice, and consequently on 10 November 2004 (after much deliberation by a special working party) the Grand Chapter (at its regular meeting in London) overturned this compromise position, and declared the Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right, albeit the natural progression from the third degree. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position were removed, by <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While the Act of Union of 1813 {{recognised}} the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch {{as part of}} [...] "pure, antient masonry", {{the wording}} in the United Grand Lodge of England's Book of Constitutions that [...] "...pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, viz. those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch." [...] was subsequently often interpreted {{to suggest that the}} Holy Royal Arch was not an additional degree, but merely the completion of the Master Mason degree. That view was so widely held among freemasons in England and Wales that in the Royal Arch ritual the newly exalted candidate was informed that he must not think that he had taken a fourth degree but that he had in fact completed his third. Statements to this effect can on occasion still be found today, e.g. [...] "When a Freemason has attained the rank of a Master Mason he is then entitled (...) to be exalted into a Royal Arch Chapter in order to complete fully his Master Mason's Degree." [...] While expressing a compromise position between the traditional views of the [...] "Antients" [...] and [...] "Moderns", this interpretation put the Holy Royal Arch in opposition to masonic practice in most countries outside England and Wales. No other masonic constitution ever claimed that the Third Degree and the Royal Arch are two parts of a single whole. The Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England eventually questioned its own reasoning. In December 2003, the United Grand Lodge of England acknowledged and pronounced the status of the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch to be “an extension to, but neither a superior nor a subordinate part of, the degrees which precede it”. On 10 November 2004, after deliberations by a special working party, the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England at its regular meeting in London formally overturned the compromise position of 1813, and declared the Holy Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right, albeit the natural progression from the Third Degree, and the completion of [...] "pure ancient Masonry", which consists of the three Craft degrees and the Holy Royal Arch. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position and led to misinterpretations were removed by <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation.</b> The official position of the Supreme Grand Chapter today is that the [...] "Royal Arch is the continuation of Craft Freemasonry"; in that sense, [...] "“pure ancient Masonry” {{can be seen as a}} journey of self-knowledge and discovery with the Royal Arch completing the practical lessons of the Craft by a contemplation of man’s spiritual nature." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility for}} governance authorities to avoid {{a large part of}} regulatory costs, by simply backing up social norms with a threat of collective punishment. Specifically, we consider the case of fisheries in which the regulatory cap is to sustain an optimal conservation level. We identify a <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> such that, when it is used as a threat, it ensures that the cap is voluntarily implemented. The mandatory scheme is based on a incentive mechanism which secures the returns of the harvester, and a tax on potential capacity. From the status of mere threat, this <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> takes time to be enforced though. We show that such a tax scheme, even if it is applied randomly after the first occurrence of a deviation from the optimal conservation level, ensures voluntary compliance, provided a suitable choice of the capacity tax. We study the properties of this tax scheme and build an example using data on the scallop fishery in the Saint-Brieuc Bay (France) to illustrate our point...|$|E
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{disclosure}} {{has attracted}} attention from regulatory bodies and academics {{over the past}} few decades. Due to the unreliability resulted from CSR voluntary disclosure, an increasing number of researchers are calling for more government regulation on CSR disclosure.

We further hypothesize and test for the moderating effect of firm size and other characteristics on the link between government regulation on CSR reporting quality. Our results suggest that government <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> leads to an overall improvement in CSR reporting quality. We also find that this positive effect is greater when firms are larger and have better financial performance, but less when firms are controlled by government. Our study provides a direct answer to the recent calling for mandatory disclosure on CSR reports, and helps to understand why recent studies of social disclosure regulation suggest that government interventions do not seem to resolve the problems that are generally attributed to voluntary disclosures.
