40|$|This Bachelor´s {{thesis is}} focused on {{analysis}} of time series of monthly mean <b>temperatures</b> and <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures.</b> These temperatures are observed on eight meteorological stations between the years 1949 - 2013. The data {{were obtained from the}} database of European Climate Assessment & Data. Stations are divided into two groups according to Köppen climate classification. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to observe and compare the development of individual time series in both groups using basic characteristics and methods based on time series decomposition and to verify that the observed station´s climate type classification is correct. Another aim is to verify the hypothesis that monthly mean <b>temperatures</b> and <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> has increased in the observed period...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver half of Australia's {{population}} lives in its southeastern quadrant. Temperature {{records for the}} 55 -year period 1958 - 2013 indicate that hot summers have occurred increasingly since the 1990 s with daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> reaching 10 °C above normal. The extreme nature {{of the change in}} <b>monthly</b> mean <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> (∼ 1 to 1. 5 °C above the long term mean) far exceeds the natural variability expected over a half century. Numerous <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> records have been set and the extreme heat poses a major socioeconomic threat. This work examines changes in mean values of <b>maximum</b> daily <b>temperatures</b> for each summer month, in southeastern Australia. A 10 -site dataset, for 1958 - 2013, was drawn and resampled to quantify temporal changes and uncertainty in decadal <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Resampling methods documented the historical uniqueness of the <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> in recent decades. Results suggest strongly that, in recent decades, the <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceeding the upper quartile of the historical data is greater than expected by random chance. The findings confirm the regional nature of the warming. The increase in summer temperature is partly related to changes in atmospheric blocking...|$|R

Temperature is one of the most vital elements of the climate system and modeling of the temperature helps the interested party those who are depending on it directly or indirectly to prepare in advance. The aim of this study is to develop a time series model which can help in improving the predictions of monthly temperature of Katunayake. This paper describes the Box-Jenkins time series seasonal ARIMA model for prediction of <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> in Katunayake region, Sri Lanka. In this study, 181 monthly temperature data were considered during the period 2001 - 2016. For the model selection, 169 observations were used while the rest of 12 observations were used to validate the model. The results indicate that the SARIMA(3, 0, 2) (2, 0, 2) 12 model was the best model to predict <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> in Katunayake region...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} trend estimation {{techniques for}} <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>temperature</b> time series {{observed in the}} 48 conterminous United States over the last century. While most scientists concur that this region has warmed on aggregate, there is no a priori {{reason to believe that}} temporal trends in extremes and averages will exhibit the same patterns. Indeed, under minor regularity conditions, the sample partial sum and maximum of stationary time series are asymptotically independent (statistically). Previous authors have suggested that minimum temperatures are warming faster than <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the United States; such an aspect can be investigated via the methods discussed in this study. Here, statistical models with extreme value and changepoint features are used to estimate trends and their standard errors. A spatial smoothing is then done to extract general structure. The results show that <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> are not often greatly changing—perhaps surprisingly, there are many stations that show some cooling. In contrast, the minimum temperatures show significant warming. Overall, the southeastern United States shows the least warming (even some cooling), and the western United States, northern Midwest, and New England have experienced the most warming...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} El Nino and La Nina have been {{considered}} as the major variables in weather changes in the Middle East. This issue has been shown by regression indexes {{in a number of}} papers. The presented study has proven that the El Nino and La Nina should be added to the weather forecast variables because of their major effects. Weather forecasts could be influenced by some variables that have uncertainty, so the deterministic approaches may lead to incorrect predictions. The proposed algorithm can be used when some variables have uncertainty. In this study, a probabilistic approach has been chosen to show the effect of El Nino and La Nina on the <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature.</b> Different ENSO Indices have been proposed for El Nino or La Nina occurrences but each of them has some deficiencies. In order to overcome the drawback of using one of the ENSO Indices, the fuzzy based analysis approach has been chosen in this paper. Data from Chabahar, one of the stations in the south of Iran, has been chosen for the algorithm to be applied on. MATLAB has been used to run the algorithm on the data.
