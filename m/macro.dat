Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla, in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year. Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect, Naevius Sutorius <b>Macro,</b> an important ally. <b>Macro</b> spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared, his next step was to choose Naevius Sutorius <b>Macro,</b> {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, <b>Macro</b> assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E

5|$|When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, {{his estate}} and {{the titles of}} the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, Gemellus, who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still {{conjecture}} that he was murdered. Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect, <b>Macro,</b> smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to {{the joy of the}} Roman people, while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian. Seneca the Elder and Philo, who both wrote during Tiberius's reign, as well as Josephus record Tiberius as dying a natural death. Backed by <b>Macro,</b> Caligula had Tiberius's will nullified with regard to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius's wishes.|$|E

5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius <b>Macro.</b> The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{originally}} planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett {{in the lead}} roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, {{and was able to}} resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles.

40|$|<b>Macros</b> have {{traditionally}} been viewed as operations on syntax trees or even on plain strings.
