25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael <b>M.</b> Burns, <b>Jean-Marc</b> Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|R

A nearly complete conversion is observed with a selectivity into caprolactone above 80 %. The observation of an induction period in the kinetics, of high activity of the non-pillared clay, and the detection of Fe traces in the reaction medium, suggest a process involving homogenous catalysis. The reaction is indeed catalysed in homogeneous phase by a few ppm of Fe.

The variation in the atomic ratio between components in catalysts is the key for the control of activity and selectivity. In samples with atomic composition Sn/V/Nb/Sb 1 / 0. 2 / 1 /x (0 <= x <= 5) and 1 / 0. 2 /y/ 3 (0 <= y <= 3) several compounds formed, i. e., SnO 2, Sb/Nb mixed oxide, Sb 6 O 13 and non-stoichiometric rutile-type V/Nb/Sb/O; the latter segregated preferentially at the surface of the catalyst. Tin oxide provided the rutile matrix for the dispersion of the mixed oxides. The main role of Sb was shown to generate mixed oxides containing specific sites for the allylic ammoxidation of propylene intermediately formed. The presence of Nb enhanced the activity and selectivity of these sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The Fe-Al-Cu {{formulation}} {{was demonstrated}} to {{be a highly}} promising Cr-free WGS catalyst in our previous work. Cu contributes significantly to the activity enhancement as a structural promoter The. extent of Cu's promotional effect is largely dependent on how Cu is doped into the iron oxide structure during catalyst preparation. In this paper, effects of preparation methods on catalyst activity were investigated. A sol-gel technique was introduced forcatalyst synthesis. Catalysts synthesized by a sol-gel technique were compared to those prepared by a 1 -step precipitation or a 2 -step precipitation-impregnation techniques. Steady state reaction data showed that sol-gel Fe-Al-Cu exhibited a much higher activity than Fe-Al-Cu catalysts prepared {{with the other two}} methods and surpassed the commercial catalyst over a wide reaction temperature range. Characterization results indicated that Cu was uniformly distributed in the iron oxide structure for the sol-gel catalysts. A mixture of iron oxide crystal phases were observed for sol-gel Fe-Al-Cu. Sol-gel preparation created a large amount of oxygen vacancies in the structure, which facilitates the redox cycle during the WGS reaction. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Transformation of methane, {{the most}} {{abundant}} and the least reactive compound of natural gas to valuable products {{is one of the}} most difficult chemical problems of great practical importance. In Nature, methane monooxygenase enzymes transform methane to methanol in water under physiological conditions. However, chemical analogs for such a transformation are unknown. Here, we show the mild and efficient aqueous oxidation of methane by hydrogen peroxide, an ecologically and biologically relevant oxidant catalyzed by supported mu-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine dimer, ((FePcBu 4) -Bu-t) (2) N. This bio-inspired complex containing a stable Fe-N-Fe motif catalyzes the oxidation of methane to methanol which is further transformed to formaldehyde and formic acid as is demonstrated using, (CH 4) -C- 13 and O- 18 labelling. ((FePcBu 4) -Bu-t) (2) N-H 2 O 2 system shows a high activity in the oxidation of benzene to phenol which occurs via formation of benzene oxide and exhibits NIH shift typically accociated with biological oxidation. Mechanistic features of oxidation of methane and benzene as well as detected inter-mediate hydroperoxo- and high valent oxo diiron complexes support an O-atom transfer reaction mechanism relevant to bio-oxidation.

Small changes at the periphery of the phthalocyanine ligand introduce a difference in the iron oxidation state. While 3 b with tert-butyl substituents is a neutral complex with a mixed-valence Fe- 3. 5 -N-Fe- 3. 5 structural unit, 3 a having n-hexyl substituents is an oxidized cationic Fe-IV-N-Fe-IV complex. The structural parameters of N-bridged diiron phthalocyanine with a Fe- 3. 5 -N-Fe- 3. 5 unit were determined for the first time. Iron atoms in 3 b are displaced out of plane by 0. 24 angstrom and the Fe-N bond distance of the linear Fe-N-Fe fragment is equal to 1. 67 angstrom. Both complexes selectively catalyze benzylic oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds by (BuOOH) -Bu-t. Toluene was oxidized to benzoic acid with 80 % selectivity, and the total turnover number was as high as 197. p-Toluic acid was the principal product of p-xylene oxidation.

Oxygen {{exchange}} constants {{and oxygen}} diffusion coefficients {{were determined by}} relaxation (TGA-DSC and in situ XRD) and steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) techniques {{as a function of}} oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and Co content for La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 CoyFe 1 -yO 3 -delta (y = 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3). When y = 0. 2, oxygen exchange constants and oxygen diffusion coefficients appeared to be enhanced once above the temperature at which the unit cell symmetry increased from rhombohedral to cubic. Oxygen partial pressure demonstrated minimal influence upon these properties over the higher range (near ambient) studied, but showed a major impact when results obtained near ambient oxygen partial pressures are compared to those obtained under N- 2. The direction of oxygen transport was also important. Oxygen exchange constants and oxygen diffusion coefficients calculated from oxidation steps were greater than values for the same properties calculated from reduction steps under all conditions examined. Explanations for this behavior are proposed with use of kinetic, transport, and ESR spectroscopy data. While the oxygen exchange constant increased with Co content, the oxygen diffusion coefficient progressed through a maximum for the formations studied. The nonlinear trend for oxygen diffusivity with Co content is explained by an electronic structure change over this compositional range, which aligned with differences in Mossbauer spectra...|$|R
40|$|Marcu, Loan-Cezar Sandulescu, Loan Schuurman, Yves Millet, <b>Jean-Marc</b> <b>M.</b> The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane has been studied over titanium and zirconium pyrophosphates between 683 and 843 K, at atmospheric pressure. The catalytic results obtained in both stationary and transient conditions clearly showed that two {{reaction mechanism}}s occur on these pyrophosphates. The first mechanism is common to both ZrP 2 O 7 and TiP 2 O 7 at low temperature whereas the second mechanism is specific to TiP 2 O 7 at high temperature. Catalyst characterization by techniques like ESR and electrical conductivity measurements together with TAP experiments allow proposing different elementary steps for these mechanisms. The initial step of activation of n-butane would correspond to the attack of the alkane molecules by O- species giving radicals on both catalysts. On ZrP 2 O 7, the radical formed should rapidly undergo a second hydrogen abstraction according to a similar mechanism leading to butene. On TiP 2 O 7, it should transfer an electron to a reducible Ti-IV or to an anionic vacancy, transforming to an alkoxide intermediate before a subsequent dehydrogenation. In the first case the rate-limiting step would be the attack of the alkane by the O- species whereas in the second one {{it would be the}} re-oxidation of the catalytic site by diffusion of the lattice oxygen or directly by gas phase oxygen. These hypotheses are discussed in relation with all the catalytic data obtained and the physicochemical properties of the solids. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Loridant, Stephane Huynh, Quyen Millet, <b>Jean-Marc</b> <b>M.</b> Keggin-type phosphomolybdates with cesium, {{tellurium}} and vanadium as counter-cations, recently {{shown to}} be efficient for selective oxidation of isobutane, were characterized by diffuse reflectance and Raman spectroscopy. In the present study, it was shown that the Raman bands appearing {{in addition to those}} of [PMo 12 O 40](3) in these catalysts after reaction were observed with much better sensitivity using exciting lines at 647. 1 and 785 nm. This phenomenon, linked to the existence of d-d transitions and intervalence charge transfers at 680 and 860 nm, respectively, arises mainly from reduction of the probed depth and to a lesser extent, from enhancement effect using resonance Raman spectroscopy. The better sensitivity of this technique was used to follow specifically the additional bands before, during and after reaction. They were attributed to highly reduced phosphomolybdates stabilized under reaction mixture and possibly capped by Te 4 + and (V-O) (2 +). The reduced species would be present in a layer lying over unreduced Keggin salt and specifically probed using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Substitution by tellurium cations was shown to favour reduction of Keggin heteropolyanions under reaction mixture. Operando resonance Raman experiments evidenced that, for the samples without vanadium, reduced phosphomolybdates were formed above 120 degrees C during the raise up to the reaction temperature whereas for the samples with vanadium, small amount of these species was already observed before reaction because of oxidation of V 3 + to V 4 + cations during drying. This amount also increased during the thermal activation under reaction feed. The relative intensity of the additional bands was maximal when the catalysts were active and selective under reaction mixture. After reaction, this parameter was related to the selectivity to methacrolein and methacrylic acid suggesting that reduced phosphomolybdates are more selective active sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Hansen, Staffan Andersson, Arne 4 th Irsee Symposium 2007 JUN 07 - 10, 2007 Irsee, GERMANYOne of {{the most}} {{effective}} propane to acrylonitrile ammoxidation catalyst is comprised of the two phases M 1 (orthorhombic) Mo 7. 5 V 1. 5 NbTeO 29 and M 2 (pseudo-hexagonal) Mo 4 V 2 Te 2 O 20. Under reaction conditions, the two phases work in symbiosis with each other where M 1 is the paraffin activating component and M 2 is the olefin activating component. Since the catalytic improvement of either phase should result in an enhancement of the overall acrylonitrile yield, controlled substitution of certain elements in either or both phases might result in the desired improvement. Our current study concentrates on the partial substitutions of V with Ti and Te with Ce in the M 2 phase. Ti substitution results in a considerable propene activity improvement, whereas the selectivity to acrylonitrile is unaffected. Substitution with Ce, on the contrary, substantially improves the selectivity to acrylonitrile. Also, a minor improvement of the activity is notable. The acrylonitrile selectivity improvement is a result of better NH 3 utilization and comes at the expense of reduced acrolein make. XRD reveals that all of the substituted compositions retain the M 2 structure and essentially are monophasic. XANES recordings show for the bulk that the Mo is 6 +, the V is 4 +, or 4 + and 5 + when Ce is present, the Ti is 4 +, the Ce is 3 +, and the Te 4 + with some 6 + also present. According to the ESR data, in the M 2 with Ce (7 Te/ 3 Ce) only 21 % of the V is 4 +, the remainder being 5 +, which tentatively {{can be explained by the}} existence of some cation vacancies in the hexagonal channels. HRTEM imaging reveals little if any differences between the materials, all have the typical pseudo-hexagonal habit of the M 2 phase and expose a 1 - 2 nm thick surface layer without any apparent long-range ordering. XPS data show that all catalysts, including the base, are highly enriched at the surface with Te at the expense of other metals. The 7 Te/ 3 Ce composition exhibits also substantial Ce surface enrichment. Moreover, the valences of the cations at the surface differ from the bulk in that for all fresh catalysts V is 5 + and Te is 6 + on the surface. Characterization by XPS of catalysts used in propene ammoxidation, reveals reduction of Te and, except when Ce is present, also Mo. Therefore, it might be inferred that the surfaces of the catalysts studied here are comprised essentially of one or a few monolayers of TeMoO or TeCeMoO on an interacting M 2 crystalline base...|$|R
