5|$|Judge J. Depue LeBar {{moved to}} Shawnee from Pahaquarry Township, New Jersey in about 1850, {{and by the}} end of the decade he'd opened a general store in the village. In 1888 the River School was built near Shawnee, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and {{sporting}} a roof-framing system with wood and iron truss members.|$|E
5|$|Muncy Creek {{was known}} to the Native Americans as Occohpocheny. Historically, Native Americans painted on Picture Rock, a cliff on the creek. Additionally, six Native American lance heads <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> were found near the creek by Joseph Fahrenbach {{in the autumn of}} 1872.|$|E
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware and designs glazed onto {{porcelain}} wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity {{to those in}} painting. These items {{could be found in}} the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E

5|$|Higher (av. 9m) and thicker (av. 3m) walls. Walls were <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> or {{stone facing}} with rubble core. The greater {{thickness}} would protect the wall from enemy mining. The {{height of the}} walls would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the rampart would have crenellations to provide protection from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|Rodmarton Manor is {{a country}} house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, around a large {{circular}} courtyard, covered in grass {{which is designed to}} be reminiscent of a village green. The majority of the building is two storeys high and made of coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> slate, with grouped chimneystacks.|$|E

5|$|Stephen was crowned {{the first}} king of Hungary on either December 25, 1000, or January1, 1001. He {{consolidated}} his rule {{through a series}} of wars against semi-independent local rulers, including his maternal uncle, Gyula. He proved his kingdom's military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> earth or timber provided defense at the kingdom's borders. A wide zone known as gyepü was intentionally left uninhabited for defensive purposes along the frontiers. Most of the early medieval fortresses in Hungary were made of earth and timber.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs {{dug into the}} sides of {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, Baldwin {{noticed that}} the Norwalk Seminary, located in Norwalk, Ohio, was {{dissolving}} {{due to lack of}} funds. He approached Thomas Thompson, who was the elder of the Norwalk District (which included Cleveland and Berea), and asked him to visit Berea. At Baldwin's Old Red House, an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk Seminary. Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9, 1846. It was meant to open in 1845, but the process was delayed until the completion of a building on Baldwin's farm, which was erected by Baldwin himself, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> quarried on his farm and brick made of clay. The institute was open to people of all races, male or female, as Baldwin wanted. It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855. The university later became Baldwin–Wallace College in 1913.|$|E
25|$|The prisoners {{constructed}} a memorial inscribed in Japanese to their faithful dead {{in front of}} one of the huts. The memorial was described as a very fine piece <b>of</b> work and <b>made</b> <b>of</b> reddish <b>stone.</b> The base was <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> inlayed in concrete with a rough oblong block <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> with a smoothed face panel as its tablet. This panel had the Japanese inscription.|$|R

5000|$|The name Chassepierre {{comes from}} Casa petrea, the Latin for [...] "stone house". Indeed, {{the houses of}} the village are mostly <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> from the 18th and 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now {{also have a}} girls choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, {{that part of the}} building that contains the stalls, usually to the east of the central tower but sometimes extending under it, is called the choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from the nave of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from the nave and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. The nave of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and is usually the oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in Haćki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igołomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th– to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia.|$|E

5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> with the mantapa's parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E
25|$|The rubble in {{most cases}} {{completely}} covered and obscured even {{the location of the}} streets. Residences made out of wood with only the walls and chimneys <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> had been largely consumed by the fires.
