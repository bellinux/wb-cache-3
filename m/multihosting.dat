40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} rate of presence of whipworms of genus Trichuris in bodies of selected ruminants (sheep, roe deer) in certain areas and to morphologically state different species of whipworms using molecular revision and professional literature on samples found during helmitological dissections of selected ruminants. Two hypotheses were stated: H 1 : species that are found in highest volume in case of roe deer and sheep are whipworms Trichuris discolor and Trichuris ovis H 2 : these whipworms can not be positively distinguished when using morphometrical methods. Material needed for the study, i. e. the intestines of examined ruminants, was recovered in different areas of Czech Republic. Later were the intestines dissected in a laboratory using standardized procedure and hereby collected samples were analysed. Based on selected methods it was determined that in roe deer the rate of occurence of Trichuris discolor is much higher compared to that of Trichuris ovis. With sheep the difference between rates of presence is smaller. These results confirm the first hypothesis by showing high rate of presence of whipworms in these hosts. Collected females of genus Trichurids were morphometrically differentiated by their sex and in 4 morphotypes. Following this differentiation, the most present were the females of morphotype M 2, those with a vulval opening without an everted vagina. The second hypothesis was also confirmed. <b>Multihosting</b> species Trichuris discolor and Trichuris ovis are prevalent in the bodies of roe deer and sheep. Thus we can say the roe deer are a potential source of whipworm contamination to sheep breeding. It can not be excluded that sheep are infected by roe deer and vice versa. Molecular determination is a necessary tool for correct assessment of whipworm species, considering the fact that morphological methods may lead to incorrect results...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that most parasites can infect multiple host species and that these are primarily responsible for emerging infectious disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife. However, the ecologic and evolutionary factors that constrain or facilitate such emergences are poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework based on the pathogen’s between- and within-species transmission rates to describe possible configurations of a multihost-pathogen community {{that may lead to}} disease emergence. We establish 3 dynamic thresholds separating 4 classes of disease outcomes, spillover, apparent <b>multihost,</b> true <b>multihost,</b> and potential emerging infectious disease; describe possible disease emergence scenarios; outline the population dynamics of each case; and clarify existing terminology. We highlight the utility of this framework with examples of disease threats in human and wildlife populations, showing how it allows us to understand which ecologic factors affect disease emergence and predict the impact of host shifts in a range of disease systems. Models of host-pathogen dynamics have typically assumed a single-host population infected by a single pathogen. However, most pathogens can infect several host species;> 60 % of human pathogens,> 68 % of wild primate parasites, and> 90 % of domesticated animal pathogens infect multiple host species (1 – 3). An interest in <b>multihost</b> pathogens is particularly timely, given that many of the most threatening current pathogens (e. g., HIV, West Nile virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus) are believed to have crossed species barriers to infect humans, domesticated animals, or wildlife populations (1, 3 – 8).

40|$|Modelling {{virulence}} {{evolution of}} <b>multihost</b> parasites in heterogeneous host systems requires {{knowledge of the}} parasite biology over its various hosts. We modelled the evolution of virulence of a generalist plant virus, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) over two hosts, in which CMV genotypes differ for within-host multiplication and virulence. According to knowledge on CMV biology over different hosts, the model allows for inoculum flows between hosts and for host co-infection by competing virus genotypes, competition affecting transmission rates to new hosts. Parameters of within-host multiplication, within-host competition, virulence and transmission were determined experimentally for different CMV genotypes in each host. Emergence of highly virulent genotypes was predicted to occur as mixed infections, favoured by high vector densities. For most simulated conditions, evolution to high virulence in the more competent Host 1 was little dependent on inoculum flow from Host 2, while in Host 2, it depended on transmission from Host 1. Virulence evolution bifurcated in each host at low, but not at high, vector densities.

40|$|Adaptation depends greatly on the {{distribution}} of mutation fitness effects (DMFE), but the phenotypic expression of mutations is often environment dependent. The environments faced by <b>multihost</b> pathogens are mostly governed by their hosts and therefore measuring the DMFE on multiple hosts can inform on the likelihood of short-term establishment and longer term adaptation of emerging pathogens. We explored this by measuring the growth rate of 36 mutants of the lytic bacteriophage phi X 174 on two host backgrounds, Escherichia coli (EcC) and Salmonella typhimurium (StGal). The DMFE showed higher mean and variance on EcC than on StGal. Most mutations were either deleterious or neutral on both hosts, but a greater proportion of mutations were deleterious on StGal. We identified two mutations with beneficial fitness effects on EcC that were neutral on StGal. Host-specific differences in fitness were associated with particular functional classes of genes involved in the initial stages of infection in accordance with previous studies of host specificity. Overall, there was a positive correlation between the effects of mutations on each host, suggesting that most new mutations will have general, rather than host-specific fitness effects. We consider these results in light of simple fitness landscape models of adaptation and discuss the relevance of context-dependent DMFE for <b>multihost</b> pathogens...|$|R

However, little is known regarding the spread of epidemics across networks representing populations of multiple hosts. We explored cross-species transmission in a multilayer network where layers represent populations of two distinct hosts, and disease can spread across intralayer (within-host) and interlayer (between-host) edges. We developed an analytic framework for the SIR epidemic model to {{examine the effect of}} (i) source of infection and (ii) between-host asymmetry in infection probabilities, on disease risk. We measured risk as outbreak probability and outbreak size in a focal host, represented by one network layer. Numeric simulations were used to validate the analytic formulations. We found that outbreak probability is determined by a complex interaction between source of infection and between-host infection probabilities, whereas outbreak size is mainly affected by the non-focal host to focal host infection probability alone. Hence, inter-specific asymmetry in infection probabilities shapes disease dynamics in <b>multihost</b> networks. These results expand current theory of monolayer networks, where outbreak size and probability are considered equal, highlighting the importance of considering multiple measures of disease risk.

Here, pathogen characteristics, host range and risk factors determining disease emergence were analysed by constructing a database of disease-causing pathogens of humans and domestic mammals. The database consisted of 1415 pathogens causing disease in humans, 616 in livestock and 374 in domestic carnivores. <b>Multihost</b> pathogens were very prevalent among human pathogens (61. 6 %) {{and even more so}} among domestic mammal pathogens (livestock 77. 3 %, carnivores 90. 0 %).

On emergence as adults, parasitoids learn chemical cues associated with their natal host and hence are more likely to locate and to oviposit in hosts of the same species. For two models incorporating different assumptions about parasitoid searching, we derive conditions for the strength of host fidelity that permits a feasible <b>multihost</b> equilibrium and argue that this equilibrium is stable whenever the corresponding single-host equilibria are stable.

40|$|Interactions between {{hosts and}} parasites have been {{hypothesized}} to cause winnerless coevolution, called Red Queen dynamics. The canonical Red Queen dynamics {{assume that all}} interacting genotypes of hosts and parasites undergo cyclic changes in abundance through negative frequency-dependent selection, which means that any genotype could become frequent at some stage. However, this prediction cannot explain why many rare genotypes stay rare in natural host-parasite systems. To investigate this, we build a mathematical model involving <b>multihost</b> and multiparasite genotypes. In a deterministic and controlled environment, Red Queen dynamics occur between two genotypes undergoing cyclic dominance changes, whereas {{the rest of the}} genotypes remain subordinate {{for long periods of time}} in phase-locked synchronized dynamics with low amplitude. However, introduction of stochastic noise in the model might allow the subordinate cyclic host and parasite types to replace dominant cyclic types as new players in the Red Queen dynamics. The factors that influence such evolutionary switching are interhost competition, specificity of parasitism, and degree of stochastic noise.

Here we develop a stochastic evolutionary model and show how genetic transfer of host segregating alleles, distributed as predicted for niche specifying genes, and the opportunity for host transition could interact to promote the emergence of host generalist lineages of the zoonotic bacterium Campylobacter. Using a modelling approach we show that increasing levels of homologous recombination enhance the efficiency with which selection can fix combinations of beneficial alleles, speeding adaptation. We then show how these predictions change in a multi-host system, with low levels of recombination, consistent with real r/m estimates, increasing the standing variation in the population, allowing a more effective response to changes in the selective landscape. Our analysis explains how observed gradients of host specialism and generalism can evolve in a <b>multihost</b> system through the transfer of ecologically important loci among coexisting strains...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe genus Echinococcus is {{composed}} of eight generally recognized species and one genotypic cluster (Echinococcus canadensis cluster) that may in future be resolved into one to three species. For each species, we review existing information on transmission routes and life cycles in different geographical contexts and - where available - include basic biological information of parasites and hosts (e. g., susceptibility of host species). While some Echinococcus spp. are transmitted in life cycles that involve predominantly domestic animals (e. g., dog - livestock cycles), others are wildlife parasites that do or do not interact with domestic transmission. In many cases, life cycle patterns of the same parasite species differ according to geography. Simple life cycles contrast with transmission patterns that are highly complex, involving <b>multihost</b> systems that may include both domestic and wild mammals. Wildlife transmission may be primary or secondary, i. e., resulting from spillovers from domestic animals. For most of the species and regions, existing information does not yet permit a conclusive description of transmission systems. Such data, however, would be highly relevant, e. g., for anticipation of geographical changes of the presence and frequency of these parasites in a warming world, or for initiating evidence-based control strategies...|$|R

[URL] 2014 Duffus et al. The rate at which pathogens are emerging appears to be increasing. Therefore, it is important to determine the factors, such as virulence and host specificity, and how they have been affected by the emergence. In the United Kingdom, ranaviruses, which are double stranded DNA viruses (Family Iridoviridae) began to emerge in populations of common frogs (Rana temporaria) in the mid-to-late 1980 s, followed closely by emergence in common toad (Bufo bufo) populations. Here we present experimental evidence that a single host may be able to maintain a <b>multihost</b> pathogen. We exposed common frog tadpoles and common toad tadpoles to ranavirus isolates from the mid- 1990 s at two different doses. Tadpole survival differed significantly between treatments and this was primarily driven by the dose of the exposure. However, at the low dose, common frog tadpoles exposed to isolates from common frogs experienced higher mortality (n 35 /treatment, log-rank: P 0. 0320, Wilcoxon: P 0. 0835, df 1) than those exposed to common toad isolates. The high dose caused 75...|$|R
