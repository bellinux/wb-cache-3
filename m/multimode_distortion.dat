5000|$|For {{this class}} of profiles, <b>multimode</b> <b>distortion</b> is {{smallest}} when [...] takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite , the profile becomes a step-index profile.|$|E
50|$|Modal {{dispersion}} is a distortion mechanism {{occurring in}} multimode fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes. Other names for this phenomenon include <b>multimode</b> <b>distortion,</b> multimode dispersion, modal distortion, intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion.|$|E
50|$|Two main {{types of}} optical fiber used in optic {{communications}} include multi-mode optical fibers and single-mode optical fibers. A multi-mode optical fiber has a larger core (â‰¥ 50 micrometers), allowing less precise, cheaper transmitters and receivers {{to connect to}} {{it as well as}} cheaper connectors. However, a multi-mode fiber introduces <b>multimode</b> <b>distortion,</b> which often limits the bandwidth and length of the link. Furthermore, because of its higher dopant content, multi-mode fibers are usually expensive and exhibit higher attenuation. The core of a single-mode fiber is smaller (<10 micrometers) and requires more expensive components and interconnection methods, but allows much longer, higher-performance links.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the electron-electron (e-e) {{interaction}} on the Peierls lattice distortions due to the electron-lattice (e-l) interaction is studied in the two-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model, treating the fluctuation of e-e interaction around the Hartree-Fock solution within the 2 nd order perturbation theory. In our previous work, using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we found <b>multimode</b> Peierls lattice <b>distortions</b> with wave vectors, the nesting vector Q and those parallel to it, are not affected by an e-e interaction if it is weak compared with the e-l coupling. The phase transition between the BOW (bond order wave) with <b>multimode</b> lattice <b>distortions</b> and the SDW (spin density wave) with the wave vector Q behaves as the 1 st order transition. The property of the multimode BOW is found to change drastically {{when we consider the}} fluctuation effect within the 2 nd order perturbation theory. The Fourier components of the multimode BOW increase gradually as the e-e interaction parameter is increased. Especially the Fourier component with the wave vector equal to the smallest reciprocal lattice vector {{in the presence of the}} multimode BOW is most strongly affected by the fluctuation effect.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the point spread {{function of a}} <b>multimode</b> fiber. The <b>distortion</b> of the focal spot created on the fiber output facet is studied {{for a variety of}} the parameters. We develop a theoretical model of wavefront shaping through a multimode fiber and use it to confirm our experimental results and analyze the nature of the focal distortions. We show that aberration-free imaging with a large field of view can be achieved by using an appropriate number of segments on the spatial light modulator during the wavefront-shaping procedure. The results describe aberration limits for imaging with multimode fibers as in, e. g., microendoscopy...|$|R
