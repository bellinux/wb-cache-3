5|$|Meade {{had his own}} detractors as well. Similar to the {{situation}} with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, {{but he had the}} misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. <b>Most</b> <b>politicians,</b> including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—Winfield S. Hancock, John Gibbon, Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.|$|E
25|$|Lee was re-elected {{regularly}} by huge margins even as {{he managed}} to become embroiled in controversy. Defying every notion of political good sense, he unabashedly - and often indelicately - took stands considered taboo by <b>most</b> <b>politicians.</b> His shoot-from-the-hip style often made his closest advisers cringe even as it endeared him to voters.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} won a {{third term}} at the 1937 election, with 44 of 74 seats and 50.6 percent of the two-party preferred vote against a reunited Labor Party led by John Curtin. As the international situation darkened in the late 1930s, Lyons, a long-term pacifist, became increasingly despondent. <b>Most</b> <b>politicians</b> expected that he would soon be replaced by Menzies, who resigned from Cabinet in protest at the government's inaction on the national insurance scheme.|$|E

25|$|Because of the offence {{likely to}} be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this usage, <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> and {{official}} figures have avoided this usage since the early 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from earlier times. For a long time it was common for fans of the England football team to wave the British Union Flag—with {{the use of the}} specifically English St George's Cross flag only gaining popularity at the Euro 96 tournament.|$|E
25|$|Another {{murder that}} caused great {{upheaval}} {{took place on}} 2 November 2004, when film director and publicist Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with radical Islamic beliefs, because of Van Gogh's alleged blasphemy. One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamist terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of radical Islam and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration. The personal protection of <b>most</b> <b>politicians,</b> especially of the Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was stepped up to unprecedented levels.|$|E
25|$|A protest march {{against the}} PRC law {{took place on}} March 26 and it was widely {{reported}} that one million Taiwanese participated in the protest. Both the former President Lee Teng-hui and President Chen Shui-bian joined the march. However, Chen Shui-bian announced in advance that he would only attend the march without giving a speech. On the other hand, <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> from the Pan-Blue Coalition {{did not participate in}} any protest march, although they claimed that they would not dissuade their supporters from attending if they ever wished. The turnout of the march became a subject of political debate in Taiwan, with the then mayor of Taipei city, Ma Ying-jeou, downplaying the participant number to around 270,000, while the march organizers claiming the goal of one million participants was reached.|$|E

25|$|McKenna {{was born}} in Apohaqui, New Brunswick, Canada. He {{was raised in the}} home of his grandparents, who lived {{adjacent}} to his parents, because his large family could not be wholly housed in his parents' home. After completing high school in Sussex, New Brunswick, he completed a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Economics at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He began graduate studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but after working for a stint with Allan MacEachen he took MacEachen's advice that <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> are lawyers and enrolled in law school at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. After he obtained a law degree, he moved to Chatham, New Brunswick, and began the practice of law. He became famous and something of a folk hero, particularly among Acadians, as the defence lawyer in the high-profile murder case of famous New Brunswick boxing champion, Yvon Durelle, in what was a widely publicized case.|$|E
500|$|Like <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> of his time, Harding {{accepted}} that patronage and graft {{would be used}} to repay political favors. He arranged for his sister Mary (who was legally blind) to be appointed asa teacher at the Ohio School for the Blind, although there were better-qualified candidates. In another trade, he offered publicity in his newspaper in exchange for free railroad passes for himself and his family. According to Sinclair, [...] "it is doubtful that Harding ever thought there was anything dishonest in accepting the perquisites of position or office. Patronage and favors seemed the normal reward for party service in the days of Hanna." ...|$|E
500|$|A more {{dangerous}} opponent than Howson was William Aberhart, the Calgary preacher who was proposing {{a form of}} social credit to cure the province's ills. Social credit, the brainchild of British engineer C. H. Douglas, purported {{to bridge the gap}} between a society's production and its purchasing power; Aberhart maintained that this gap was the source of Alberta's economic hardships. Reid was leery of Aberhart though he, like <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> of the era, pronounced himself in favour of Douglas's philosophy. T. C. Byrne suggests that this expressed support was dishonest, that Reid considered social credit in all of its forms to be [...] "complete nonsense", and paid it [...] only because of its popularity among voters.|$|E

500|$|When Menem {{began his}} presidency, there was massive {{hyperinflation}} and a recession. Most economists {{of the time}} thought that the ideal solution was the Washington Consensus: reduce expenditures below {{the amount of money}} earned by the state, and open [...] international commerce to free trade. Alfonsín had proposed similar plans in the past, alongside some privatization; but those projects were resisted by the PJ. The plan was resisted by factions benefiting from the protectionist policies, but the magnitude of the crisis convinced <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> to change their minds. Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of Peronism. He invited the conservative politicians Álvaro Alsogaray and María Julia Alsogaray into his cabinet, as well as businessmen from Bunge and Born.|$|E
500|$|The Emperor's more notable {{political}} successes {{were achieved}} {{primarily because of}} the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence. He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function. The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments. <b>Most</b> <b>politicians</b> appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that PedroII was [...] "indispensable to Brazil's continued peace and prosperity." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, some African American intellectuals led by Lerone Bennett Jr., {{rejected}} Lincoln's {{role as the}} Great Emancipator. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted {{that he was not}} as bad as <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> of his day; and that he was a [...] "moral visionary" [...] who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered [...] "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" [...] in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were [...] "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason". In the 21st century, President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincoln's Bible for his swearing in to office at both his inaugurations.|$|E

500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government. Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had come in with McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were behind him, as future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak <b>most</b> <b>politicians,</b> Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes reminded us that this was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E

2500|$|The lasting {{confusion}} over the [...] "fascist" [...] tendencies of the PSF can be ascribed, in part, to two factors. First, the PSF's predecessor, the Croix-de-Feu, did aspire to a paramilitary aesthetic (described by Julian Jackson as a [...] "fascist frisson" [...] and dismissed by Rémond as [...] "political boy scouting for adults") outwardly {{similar to that}} employed by the more overtly fascist of the right-wing leagues; furthermore, La Rocque continued to defend the leagues' activities {{even in the face}} of their condemnation by the parties of the established moderate right (though not the Republican Federation). Second, the PSF's condemnation of parliamentarism, considered synonymous with French republicanism by <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> of the left and centre, marked it as inherently anti-republican — and thus [...] "fascist" [...] in the political discourse of the period — in the opinions of the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Talk of amalgamating the 6 {{municipal}} {{units in}} Pictou County {{has increased in}} recent years. Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow {{are having a hard}} time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the <b>most</b> <b>politicians</b> per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel it is only a matter of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town. [...] After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Irwin Ross {{summed up}} the contradictions in Dewey's {{personality}} by noting that [...] "more than <b>most</b> <b>politicians,</b> he displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner.

In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern {{a sense of the}} dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward." [...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E
