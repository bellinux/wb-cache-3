500|$|The Beatles first taped 25 takes of {{the song}} at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London over two nights, 29 and 30 July 1968, with George Martin as their producer. These dates served as rehearsals, however, since they planned to record the <b>master</b> <b>track</b> at Trident Studios to utilise their eight-track {{recording}} machine (Abbey Road was still limited to four-tracks). A take from 29 July, which author and critic Kenneth Womack describes as a [...] "jovial" [...] session, was issued on the Anthology 3 compilation in 1996.|$|E

He added, [...] "the creative decision-making process has become more important than technique. You have a wider range of tools, a wider range of decisions". Although remaining continually inspired to produce new music, he often struggled to write lyrics and would procrastinate.

Lanois took adverse measures to encourage his writing, such as destroying his much-used telephone in the nearby woods and, on one occasion, nailed the studio door shut to lock him inside.|$|E
