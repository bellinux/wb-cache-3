5|$|In May 1909 Wodehouse {{made his}} second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to Cosmopolitan and Collier's {{for a total}} of $500, a much higher fee than he had {{commanded}} previously. He resigned from The Globe and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many <b>more</b> <b>stories,</b> but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining The Globe and also contributing regularly to The Strand Magazine. Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any <b>more</b> <b>stories,</b> and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E

However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch <b>more</b> <b>stories,</b> and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to add <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> to the tower because of the atrium on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E
5|$|This English edition, {{the first}} version of the text in which Munchausen {{appeared}} as a fully developed literary character, had a circuitous publication history. It first appeared anonymously as Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia, a 49-page book in 12mo size, published in Oxford by the bookseller Smith in late 1785 and sold for a shilling. A second edition released early the following year, retitled Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen, added five <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> and four illustrations; though the book was still anonymous, the new text was probably by Raspe, and the illustrations may have been his work as well.|$|E

5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns {{originated}} during development of XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development of Lightning Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had wanted to tell <b>more</b> <b>stories</b> about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players to forget the story of the previous games, and the team needed to work especially hard as a result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E
