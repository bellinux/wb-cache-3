60|$|I {{spoke to}} him thus calmly and coldly, feeling no passion, feeling nothing. For in that strange hour I was no longer Thomas Wingfield, I was no longer human, I was a force, an instrument; I could think of my dead son without sorrow, {{he did not seem}} dead to me, for I partook of the nature that he had put on in this change of death. I could even think of de Garcia without hate, as though he also were nothing but a tool in some other hand. Moreover, I KNEW that he was <b>mine,</b> <b>body</b> and mind, and that he must answer and truly, so surely as he must die when I chose to kill him. He tried to shut his lips, but they opened of {{themselves}} and word by word the truth was dragged from his black heart as though he stood already before the judgment seat.|$|E

60|$|There are {{excuses for}} Eunice. She {{lives in a}} fools' paradise; and she sees in her lover a radiant creature, shining in the halo thrown over him by her own self-delusion, Nothing of this sort is {{to be said for}} me. I see Philip as he is. My {{penetration}} looks into the lowest depths of his character--when I am not in his company. There seems to be a foundation of good, somewhere in his nature. He despises and hates himself (he has confessed it to me), when Eunice is with him--still believing in her false sweetheart. But how long do these better influences last? I have only to show myself, in my sister's absence, and Philip is <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> and soul. His vanity and his weakness take possession of him the moment he sees my face. He is one of those men--even in my little experience I have met with them--who are born to be led by women. If Eunice had possessed my strength of character, he would have been true to her for life.|$|E
60|$|Drawing a {{cushioned}} seat to this secluded nook, {{where no}} person passing casually {{through the room}} {{would be able to}} see me, I sat down, and feeling too indolent to get myself a reading-stand, I supported the volume I had taken up to read on my knees. It was entitled Conduct and Ceremonial, and the subject-matter was divided into short sections, each with an appropriate heading. Turning over the leaves, and reading a sentence here and there in different sections, {{it occurred to me that}} this might prove a most useful work for me to study, whenever I could bring my mind into the right frame for such a task; for it contained minute instructions upon all points relating to individual conduct in the house--as the entertainment of pilgrims, the dress to be worn, and the conduct to be observed at the various annual festivals, with other matters of the kind. Glancing through it in this rapid way, I soon finished with the first volume, then went through the second in even less time, for many of the concluding sections related to lugubrious subjects which I did not care to linger over; the titles alone were enough to trouble me--Decay through Age, Ailments of Mind and of Body; then Death, and, finally, the Disposal of the Dead. This done I took up the third volume, the last of the series, the first portion of which was headed, Renewal of the Family. This part I began to examine with some attention, and pretty soon discovered that I had now at last accidentally stumbled upon a perfect mine of information of the precise kind I had so long and so vainly been seeking. Struggling to overcome my agitation I read on, hurrying through page after page with the greatest rapidity; for there was here much matter that had no special interest for me, but incidentally the things which concerned me most to know were touched on, and in some cases minutely explained. As I proceeded, the prophetic gloom which had oppressed me all that day, and for so many days before, darkened to the blackness of despair, and suddenly throwing up my arms, the book slipped from my knees and fell with a crash upon the floor. There, face downwards, with its beautiful leaves doubled and broken under its weight, it rested unheeded at my feet. For now the desired knowledge was mine, and that dream of happiness which had illumined my life was over. Now I possessed the secret of that passionless, everlasting calm of beings who had for ever outlived, and left as immeasurably far behind as the instincts of the wolf and ape, the strongest emotion of which my heart was capable. For the children of the house there could be no union by marriage; in body and soul they differed from me: they had no name for that feeling which I had so often and so vainly declared; therefore they had told me again and again that there was only one kind of love, for they, alas! could experience one kind only. I did not, for the moment, seek further in the book, or pause to reflect on that still unexplained mystery, which was the very center and core of the whole mater, namely, the existence of the father and mother in the house, from whose union the family was renewed, and who, fruitful themselves, were yet the parents of a barren race. Nor did I ask who their successors would be: for albeit long-lived, they were mortal like their own passionless children, and in this particular house their lives appeared now to be drawing to an end. These were questions I cared nothing about. It was enough to know that Yoletta could never love me as I loved her--that she could never be <b>mine,</b> <b>body</b> and soul, in my way and not in hers. With unspeakable bitterness I recalled my conversation with Chastel: now all her professions of affection and goodwill, all her schemes for smoothing my way and securing my happiness, seemed to me the veriest mockery, since even she had read my heart no better than the others, and that chill moonlight felicity, beyond which her children were powerless to imagine anything, had no charm for my passion-torn heart.|$|E
5000|$|The MON-100 <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> has a smooth, well {{finished}} appearance with a webbing handle {{mounted on}} the upper edge, it is usually attached to a mounting shackle by wing nuts {{on either side of}} the <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> (the shackle is connected to a spike for securing the mine to buildings, trees etc.). The concave face of the mine has a detonator cavity in its center (this is the side aimed at the target).|$|E
5000|$|The TQ-Mi is an {{obsolete}} circular Czechoslovakian anti-tank blast <b>mine.</b> The <b>mines</b> <b>body</b> is made {{of cardboard}} impregnated with asphalt. A central pressure cap {{is made of}} glass, which sits {{on top of a}} chemical fuze, which is crushed open onto the booster charge. The booster charge is embedded in the TNT main charge, above which are a number of scrap metal fragments, giving a secondary anti-personnel effect.|$|R
50|$|The MC-71 is a Romanian tilt-rod fuzed {{anti-tank}} landmine. The <b>mine's</b> <b>body</b> {{consists of}} two truncated cones, the lower of the cones contains the main charge and fuzing mechanism. The main charge is a large shaped charge, which triggers 200 ms to 400 ms after the tilt rod is activated. The tilt rod can be deployed away from the mine, potentially making it effective against clearance vehicles using mine rollers and mine flails.|$|R
50|$|The FFV 016 is a Swedish {{designed}} {{off-route mine}} {{designed for use}} against lightly armoured vehicles. The mine uses a Misznay Schardin effect warhead to produce a self-forging fragment that has an initial velocitiy of approximately 2,000 metres per second and can penetrate 60 mm of armour at 30 metres range. The <b>mine's</b> <b>body</b> is circular, with a dished front which is aimed using a simple built in sight along the expected route of the target.|$|R
50|$|On firing, a {{metal base}} plate {{remains in the}} ground, while the <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> is thrown up by a small lifting charge, but remains {{attached}} to a strong wire tether. When {{the end of the}} tether is reached at a height of approximately 0.5 m, the main charge explodes and scatters fragments of the casing across a wide area.|$|E
50|$|The mine has a grenade-like {{main body}} with a diamond grooved {{fragmentation}} pattern, although it sometimes uses other patterns. Internally, the mine uses a stick of commercial plastic explosiveheld centrally by a ring of {{the same type of}} explosive {{at the bottom of the}} main body. Additional fragmentation material is packed inside the gap between the main charge and the <b>mine</b> <b>body.</b> The mine uses a locally produced fuse similar to the Russian MUV fuse.|$|E
5000|$|Once the fuze is triggered, {{the inner}} <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> is {{projected}} {{into the air}} by a small explosive charge. The outer shell of the mine remains in the ground, and {{is attached to the}} inner body by a short length of wire. This wire pulls taut once the mine has risen to a height of approximately one metre. The jerking action pulls a striker into a detonator, triggering the main charge of the mine.|$|E
5000|$|The TM 65 (Telamiina 65) is a {{circular}} Finnish minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. It is broadly {{based on the}} Russian TM-62 <b>mine.</b> The <b>mines</b> <b>body</b> is made from a thin shell of fibreglass over a cast block of explosive, with a central fuze well that holds the pressure fuze. The original TM 65 used a US-65 fuze as used in the SM-65 anti-personnel mine, the later TM 65 77 uses a pressure fuze similar to the Russian MV-5 fuze called Painesytytin 77.|$|R

50|$|The VAR/40 {{is a small}} landmine, {{designed}} to be carried by individual soldiers and hand laid. It was initially produced for the Italian army in the 1970s, and was exported to {{a large number of}} countries. The <b>mines</b> <b>body</b> is circular with a ribbed plastic body split into upper and lower halves. The upper half holds the pressure-sensitive fuze mechanism, which is covered by a truncated rubber cone. The fuze is covered by a safety cap that prevents accidental activation. The safety cap also has a threaded well, which holds the detonator during transit.|$|R

50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic pressure plate, and the lower body containing the main charge. The pressure plate has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The pressure plate is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the pressure plate to collapse onto the <b>mine</b> <b>body,</b> triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|E
5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by the tilting of the prongs situated {{on top of the}} mine. This is caused by either direct pressure on the prongs or by tension on a tripwire attached to them. Tilting the prongs allows three striker retaining balls to escape. This releases the spring-loaded striker, which is flipped downwards into the percussion cap and fires the three gram propellant charge. The explosion of the propellant charge forces the upper half of the <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> out of the ground and up into the air, shearing off several brass screws and leaving the base plug of the mine behind in the ground.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mine's</b> <b>body</b> is {{tethered}} to its base {{by a short}} length of wire, which unwinds behind it as it rises. When the mine reaches a height of approximately 65 centimetres the wire is pulled. This jerks the detonator assembly downwards into the striker. The detonator fires, triggering the main explosive charge, which shatters the internally grooved body into {{a large number of}} high-velocity steel fragments, which spray in all directions. Because the time taken from triggering the mine to detonation is so short (typically one second), there is no time to take cover from the blast.|$|R
25|$|Conventional metal {{detectors}} rely on electromagnetic signals with frequencies {{of the order}} of 10–100kHz, which are not sensitive to plastic or wooden <b>mine</b> <b>bodies</b> and the high explosive block itself. The only part of a low-metal mine that {{they may be able to}} detect is the detonator. Much higher frequency signals ({{of the order of}} 1GHz) are employed in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and these signals are also sensitive to the non-metallic parts of the mine. Unfortunately, as they are also affected by innocuous objects such as tree roots and stones and by local changes in soil moisture, it is difficult to distinguish a mine on a GPR image.|$|R

Matthew Hague, a night deputy, told the inquest of finding 16 bodies between [...] and : [...] "They were not burnt or scorched in the least, but appeared as if asleep." [...] James Marsh, a miner from [...] "Worsbro'dale" [...] (Worsbrough), tried to push on past Hague, but had to turn back [...] "as the air was so bad" [...] During the day the rope and cage for the No. 1 shaft were repaired and brattice was sent down to repair the stoppings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{body of the}} MRUD is {{waterproof}} and {{the mine}} {{can be used in}} temperatures from -30˚ to + 50˚ C. The <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> contains 900 grams of TNT-based explosive and 650 5.5-millimeter steel balls. When fired the fragmentation has a lethal arc of 60 degrees and a lethal range of 40-50 meters. The MRUD kit comes packed with a manual inductor, circuit test device and an EK-40-69 electric detonator. The mine can be command detonated from up to 30 meters away using a manual inductor or another electrical power source. The fuse cavities also accept any Serbian booby trap fuse with an M10 x 1 mm including the UMP-1 and UMP-2 pull and the UMNOP-1 multi-function fuse.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol. The mine {{is covered by}} a pressure plate, which {{is attached to the}} <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> by four pins which sit in vertical slots in clips that fold up {{from the bottom of the}} mine. The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure plate presses the plate down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the striker spring.|$|E
5000|$|The fuze is {{mechanical}} of pressure-lever type, permanently {{fitted in}} the mine. It has a clockwork safety, set at 1 or 4 minutes. The basic position is 1 minute. The fuze is activated by a pressure force of 1500 N (330 lbf) or more. The mine may be {{armed with a}} supplementary fuze too and may be electrically activated in controlled firing. The fuze may be activated also by action of a bar which Is fitted on the fuze after laying of the mine, with a force of 13-17 N (2-4 lbf). The fuze has an ejection charge of black powder which breaks the weakened part of the <b>mine</b> <b>body,</b> ejecting the top part with tuze, removing the clod and clearing {{the way to the}} penetrating disc to obtain a higher penetration.|$|E

5000|$|The Valmara 59 {{is a large}} {{cylindrical}} Italian bounding anti-personnel mine. It is {{the first}} in the [...] "Valmara" [...] family of mines produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica, and was followed by the Valmara 69 and VS-JAP. The <b>mine's</b> <b>body</b> is metal with a distinctive five-pronged head. The central prong has a hole, to allow the threading a trip wire. The inner <b>body</b> of the <b>mine</b> has a main charge surrounded with approximately 1,000 steel cubes, below which is a steel wire connecting it {{to the base of the}} mine. When the mine is triggered a small charge launches the mine into the air approximately 45 cm before the steel wire is pulled taut, the jolt of which pulls a striker into the detonator. A secondary time fuse triggers the mine after three seconds if it has not detonated after being triggered.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark II mine or A./T. Mine G.S. Mk II was a British {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. It consisted of a body about seven inches (18 cm) in diameter and two inches high (5 cm). The mine has a central fuze well accessed from the bottom, with a main charge in a cavity around the well consisting of about 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of TNT. The mine is fitted with a thin brass cover, which acts as a pressure plate. The cover is suspended over {{the main body of}} the main by four leaf springs. A Sorbo ring made of Sorbo rubber can be fitted between the cover and the <b>mine</b> <b>body,</b> which absorbs shock and blast and allows the mines to be planted as close as two feet (60 cm) without causing sympathetic detonation (normally five feet is the minimum safe distance).|$|E
5000|$|The MAPED F1 is a claymore shaped plastic bodied {{directional}} {{anti-personnel mine}} {{which is designed}} to wound or kill by fragmentation. It has been the standard directional anti-personnel mine of the French army since the late 70s. The <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> is flat on the back and convex on the front, it has a small aiming sight on the top left corner and plastic lugs in the bottom corners for attaching a pair of [...] "A" [...] frame support legs. The mine contains a plastic explosive charge to propel 500 steel ball fragments to a range of 50 meters in a 60' arc. It is battery powered and is normally actuated by breakwire, but tripwire and command actuation is also possible. The mine is surface mounted and it can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. The MAPED F1 can be defeated by blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and MICLIC unless it is set up for command actuation.|$|E
50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A electric detonator initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic <b>mine</b> <b>body</b> and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern.|$|E
