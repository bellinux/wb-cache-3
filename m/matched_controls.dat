40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{study the}} prevalence, incidence, and {{clearance}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Methods: In this prospective matched cohort study, 51 women, became pregnant during follow-up of an HPV epidemiology study (n= 2065), and 51 matched nonpregnant women were included. All women provided 3 -monthly cervicovaginal self-samples and completed a questionnaire. The PCR SPF(10) LiPA(25) {{was used for}} HPV testing. Matching was performed using a propensity score. Results: The cumulative prevalence of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) was 19. 6 % (n= 10) of the pregnant and 17. 6 % (n= 9) of the <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> women. The time point prevalence of any type HPV and hrHPV was not significantly different for pregnant and <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> women. After baseline, there were 10 newly detected hrHPV types in 6 (11. 8 %) of the pregnant women, and there were 11 newly detected hrHPV types in 8 (15. 7 %) of the <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> women.

25|$|People with {{executive}} dysfunction have {{a slower}} cognitive processing speed and thus often {{take longer to}} complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities.

25|$|Although {{there has}} been some debate, {{inhibition}} is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism. Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response. However, performance on the Stroop task, for example, has been unimpaired relative to <b>matched</b> <b>controls.</b> An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism. In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.|$|E

Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a fast approach for matching stereoscopic images acquired by stereo cameras mounted aboard a moving car. The proposed approach exploits the spatio-temporal consistency between consecutive frames in stereo sequences to improve matching results. This {{means that the}} matching process at current frame uses the matching results obtained at its preceding one. The preceding frame allows to compute an Initial Disparity Map for the current frame. The initial disparity map is used to derive disparity ranges for each scanline {{as well as what}} we call <b>Matching</b> <b>Control</b> Edge Points. Dynamic programming is performed for matching edge points in stereo pairs. The <b>matching</b> <b>control</b> edge points are used to drive the search for an optimal solution in the search plane. This is accomplished by dividing the dynamic programming search space into a number of subspaces depending on the number of the <b>matching</b> <b>control</b> edge points.

Design: Observe serum effect on the in-vitro growth of an interleukin- 2 -dependent cytotoxic T-cell line and determine serum level by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Setting: Outpatient rheumatology clinic of a university medical center. Patients: Sera were collected from 47 patients with sclero-derma, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 14 <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects. Measurements and Main Results: A significant mitogenic effect was observed in sera from patients with scleroderma of recent onset; a lower proliferative response was seen in rheu-matoid sera. <b>Matched</b> <b>control</b> sera had no mitogenic activi-ty. Sera from patients with scleroderma of recent onset sup-ported the in-vitro growth of an interleukin- 2 -dependent cytotoxic T-cell line. <b>Matched</b> <b>control</b> sera had no similar mitogenic activity. Interleukin- 2 was found in sera from 41 of 47 patients with scleroderma (204 i t 356 U/mL, mean i t SD), in 9 of 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (2. 04 + 5. 16), and in none of 14 <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects. There was a positive correlation between serum level and the skin progression index (skin score/disease duration). Conclusions: The presence of interleukin- 2 in scleroderma sera strongly supports a role for T-cell activation in sclero-derma. The association between serum levels and disease progression indicates that this T-cell process may participate in the progression of the disease...|$|R

2500|$|A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity {{characterize}} attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with ADHD often experience {{problems with}} organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood. In {{both children and}} adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found. As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than <b>matched</b> <b>controls</b> on interference control, mental flexibility and semantic verbal fluency. [...] Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD. However, some research has suggested {{the possibility that the}} severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits. Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} serum levels of S 100 B after head trauma with {{the effect of}} heading, high-intensity exercise, and playing in a league match. Heading and head trauma in soccer have been {{suspected}} to cause brain impairment. The protein S 100 B is a marker of acute neuronal tissue damage. METHODS: Baseline S 100 B was measured in 535 Norwegian professional soccer players. Two hundred twenty-eight head impacts were registered from 352 league matches. Three teams (n = 48) performed a high-intensity exercise session without heading and a low-intensity session with heading exercises. A blood sample was drawn from each participant within 1 hour (B 1) after the session, and another sample (B 12) was drawn after a match or training session. The players were assigned to four groups: Head Impact (n = 65), <b>Match</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>match</b> participants without head impact, n = 49), High-intensity Exercise (n = 35), and Heading (n = 36). RESULTS: Serum S 100 B increased from baseline to B 1 for all groups. The increase for the match groups (Head Impact and <b>Match</b> <b>Control)</b> {{was significantly higher than}} for both training groups. However, {{no significant differences between the}} Head Impact and <b>Match</b> <b>Control</b> groups or between the two training groups were found. A total of 39 players (33. 9 %) had elevated B 1 values (>= 0. 12 ng/ml) after a match, but these findings were equally distributed between the <b>Match</b> <b>Control</b> and Head Impact groups. CONCLUSION: Both soccer training and soccer matches cause a transient increase in S 100 B. There is a possible additive effect of activity with high intensity and heading, but minor head impacts do not seem to cause an additional increase...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{assess whether}} MRI {{detectable}} evidence of silent cerebrovascular disease is {{more prevalent in}} patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to carefully <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study of patients with OSA attending a specialist sleep clinic and <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects drawn from the normal community. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness, <b>matched</b> to 45 <b>control</b> subjects without excessive sleepiness or evidence of OSA on a sleep study. Matched variables included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All subjects underwent 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings (before treatment in OSA patients) and sagittal T 1, axial T 2, and coronal dual echo cerebral MRI imaging to detect clinically silent abnormalities related to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease; areas of high signal foci in deep white matter (DWM), lacunae, and periventricular hyperintensity. Lacunae/high signal foci in DWM and/or periventricular hyperintensity were present in 15 (33 %) OSA subjects and 16 (35 %) controls, despite significant increases in mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (4. 6 mmHg, p< 0. 05), and both nighttime diastolic (7. 2 mmHg, p< 0. 001) and systolic blood pressures (9. 2 mmHg, p< 0. 05) in OSA subjects. These data exclude more than a 17 % excess prevalence of MRI detected minor cerebrovascular disease in the OSA patients, with 95 % confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease is prevalent in both clinic patients with OSA and their <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects.

Intragastric pH, bacteria, nitrite, and N-nitroso compounds were assessed half hourly whilst ambulant and hourly when in bed. Both total and nitrate reducing bacterial counts were positively related to pH (chi 2 = 279. 3; p less than 0. 001), as was nitrite concentration (F = 19. 1; p less than 0. 0001). By contrast, total (F = 40. 6; p less than 0. 0001) and stable (F = 257. 4; p less than 0. 0001) N-nitroso compound concentrations were negatively related to pH. Clear differences in these gastric juice factors were not apparent between <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> and either pernicious anaemia, or Polya gastrectomy because the Polya gastrectomy and <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> groups were heterogeneous for gastric acidity. Thus, although eight of eight pernicious anaemia subjects were hypoacidic (defined as intragastric pH greater than 4 for greater than 50 % of both daytime and night time periods), only five of nine Polya gastrectomy and two of nine <b>matched</b> <b>control</b> subjects were hypoacidic. When subjects were rearranged into hypoacidic (n = 15) and acidic (n = 11) groups, bacterial counts (p less than 0. 01) and nitrite concentrations (p less than 0. 01) were higher, whereas N-nitroso compounds tended to be lower (NS) in the hypoacidic group. These data suggest that, although hypoacidity predisposes to bacterial overgrowth and nitrite generation, it does not enhance nitrosation. Instead, this is maximal at low pH, suggesting chemical rather than bacterial nitrosation, contrary to the nitrosamine hypothesis of gastric carcinogenesis...|$|R
