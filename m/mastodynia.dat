50|$|Danazol, an {{estrogen}} biosynthesis inhibitor, tamoxifen, an antagonistic modulator of the estrogen receptor, and bromocriptine, a prolactin-lowering D2 receptor agonist, are {{the main}} drugs used {{in the treatment of}} <b>mastodynia</b> and are effective.|$|E
50|$|Known estrogen-dependent {{conditions}} include <b>mastodynia</b> (breast pain/tenderness), breast fibroids, mammoplasia (breast enlargement), macromastia (breast hypertrophy), gynecomastia, breast cancer, {{precocious puberty}} in girls, melasma, menorrhagia, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, uterine cancers (e.g., endometrial cancer), ovarian cancer, and hyperestrogenism in males {{such as in}} certain conditions like cirrhosis and Klinefelter's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), powerfully {{suppress the}} action of estrogen in the breasts. At least one way that they do this is by reducing {{the expression of the}} estrogen receptor in breast tissue. In women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who are completely insensitive to androgens and have only modest levels of estrogen (50 pg/ml), the relatively low levels of estrogen are capable of mediating significant breast development, and the breast sizes of CAIS women, on average, are in fact actually larger than those of non-CAIS women. In males treated with antiandrogens, gynecomastia (enlargement of the breasts in males) and <b>mastodynia</b> (breast tenderness/pain) commonly occur. Antiandrogens, for instance spironolactone, are also known to cause breast enlargement and <b>mastodynia</b> in women. Some examples of widely used and highly-potent antiandrogens include cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide.|$|E

5000|$|Breast pain is {{a medical}} symptom that is most often {{associated}} with a developing disease or condition of the breast. These are usually benign breast diseases or conditions such as mastalgia, <b>mastodynia,</b> and fibrocystic breast changes. These disorders are painful and associated with lumps. Some breast pain is normal and associated with the changes that accompany puberty, pregnancy, lactation and menopause. The pain can be in one breast or both. The pain may constant, cyclical, or present only on palpation or when it is touched.|$|E
50|$|Whereas D2 {{receptor}} agonists suppress prolactin secretion, dopamine D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone and metoclopramide {{have the}} opposite effect, powerfully inducing the pituitary secretion of prolactin, and are sometimes used as prolactin releasers, for instance to correct hypoprolactinemia {{in the treatment of}} lactation failure. When such drugs are used not for the purpose of inducing prolactin secretion, increased prolactin levels may be unwanted, and can result in various side effects including mammoplasia (breast enlargement), <b>mastodynia</b> (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), gynecomastia (breast development in males), hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels), amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles), reversible infertility, and sexual dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Due to D2 {{receptor}} blockade, domperidone causes hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can {{suppress the}} secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, in turn suppressing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and resulting in hypogonadism (low sex hormone (e.g., testosterone, estradiol) levels). As such, male patients may experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis. Also {{in accordance with}} hyperprolactinemia, 10-15% of female patients {{have been reported to}} experience mammoplasia (breast enlargement), <b>mastodynia</b> (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles) with domperidone treatment. Gynecomastia has been reported in males treated with domperidone, and galactorrhea could occur in males as well.|$|E
50|$|Anovulation {{is usually}} {{associated}} with specific symptoms. However, {{it is important to}} note that they are not necessarily all displayed simultaneously. Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Infrequent and light menstruation occurs in about 40% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Another potential symptom is irregular menstruation, where five or more menstrual cycles a year are five or more days shorter or longer than the length of the average cycle. Absence of <b>mastodynia</b> (breast pain or tenderness) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory problems. Also possible is increased body mass and facial hair, which is relatively easy to treat, and is often associated with PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Mammoplasia is {{the normal}} or {{spontaneous}} {{enlargement of the}} breasts. Mammoplasia occurs normally during puberty and pregnancy in women, as well as during certain periods of the menstrual cycle. When it occurs in males, it is called gynecomastia and {{is considered to be}} pathological. When it occurs in females and is extremely excessive, it is called macromastia (also known as gigantomastia or breast hypertrophy) and is similarly considered to be pathological. Mammoplasia may be due to breast engorgement, which is temporary enlargement of the breasts caused by the production and storage of breast milk in association with lactation and/or galactorrhea (excessive or inappropriate production of milk). <b>Mastodynia</b> (breast tenderness/pain) frequently co-occurs with mammoplasia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is not fully understood but {{it is assumed that}} it has dopaminergic effects resulting in changes of prolactin secretion. At low doses, such as might have been used in previous centuries for suppression of sexual desire, it inhibits activation of dopamine 2 receptor by competitive binding, causing a slight increase in release of prolactin. In higher concentrations, as in modern extracts, the binding activity is sufficient to reduce the release of prolactin. A study has found that treatment of 20 healthy men with higher doses of Vitex agnus-castus was associated with a slight reduction of prolactin levels, whereas lower doses caused a slight increase as compared to doses of placebo. [...] A decrease of prolactin will influence levels of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen in women and testosterone in men [...] Dopaminergic compounds (diterpenes with prolactin-suppressive effects that were almost identical in their prolactin-suppressive properties to dopamine itself) present in Vitex agnus castus seem likely to be the clinically important compounds which improve premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> and possibly also psycho-somatic symptoms of PMS.|$|E
30|$|Results {{of studies}} not {{included}} in the recent review by van Die [8] are briefly discussed in the following: Women who start contraception with combined oral contraceptives (COC) frequently experience <b>mastodynia</b> which may last several months. Of particular interest is therefore the large study involving patients who suffer from <b>mastodynia</b> under COC [29]. In this study BNO 1095 (Mastodynon) proved highly effective to reduce the COC induced painful sensations.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above synthetic dopaminergic drugs ameliorated premenstrual symptoms including <b>mastodynia.</b> Due to severe {{side effects of}} these drugs many women do refuse to use conventional treatment with hormones or psychopharmaceuticals and seek often for plant derived alternatives which become therefore increasingly prevalent in the Western world. In this context, the extracts of Vitex agnus-castus fruit (VAC, chaste tree, chasteberry; family: Verbenaceae) are commonly used {{for the treatment of}} premenstrual syndrome which-as elaborated above-is often associated by premenstrual <b>mastodynia,</b> premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and corpus luteum insufficiency.|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} all trials {{suggested}} that VAC extracts ameliorated premenstrual symptoms including <b>mastodynia,</b> {{premenstrual dysphoric disorder}} and latent hyperprolactinemia. Cystic mastopathy and sterility due to corpus luteum insufficiencies were also beneficially influenced.|$|E
30|$|It is {{currently}} generally accepted that high and frequently occurring prolactin episodes stimulate proliferation of mammary gland tissue causing the uncomfortable breast sensations, i.e. <b>mastodynia</b> (mastalgia) [8]. Hence, the latent hyperprolactinemia mimicks effects seen during early pregnancy [9].|$|E
30|$|In summary for the {{efficacy}} of VAC preparations and premenstrual PMS and mastodynia: Almost all placebo controlled studies published hitherto agree that extracts of the fruit of this plant have beneficial effects on PMS, particularly on premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> (Table  2).|$|E
30|$|In another trial {{severity}} of PMS and of premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> was evaluated in 31 subjects with latent hyperprolactinemia {{prior to and}} after treatment with 40  mg of a VAC dried fruit preparation, {{which resulted in a}} significant reduction of both parameters [31].|$|E
30|$|Women with {{a latent}} or {{manifest}} hypothyroidism suffer often from <b>mastodynia</b> [41 – 43] {{and are often}} hyperprolactinemic [44], a phenomenon which is easily explainable: In an attempt to stimulate the thyroid function the hypothalamus releases high amounts of thyroid hormone releasing hormone (TRH) which is also stimulatory to prolactin release.|$|E
30|$|In aother study 120 {{women with}} latent hyperprolactinemia and mastalgia-some with nipple discharge, some without-were either treated with 2.5  mg {{bromocriptine}} or 0.24  mg Dostinex or with 40  mg of a dried VAC fruit preparation {{used to produce}} the VAC extract BNO 1095. Pain was improved and serum prolactin levels reduced in all groups. Severe side effects such as nausea and orthostatic dysregulation occurred only in the bromocriptine group. The size of mammary gland ducts, as measured by ultrasound sonography became thinner in the bomocriptine and the Dostinex group {{but not in the}} VAC group. Authors conclude that AC BNO 1055 should be the treatment of first choice in patients with <b>mastodynia</b> whereas Dostinex should be given in more severe forms of FCM. Elevated serum prolactin levels were also published for a group of women suffering from FCM in combination with premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> [40].|$|E
30|$|Taken {{together}} {{it appears}} {{quite clear that}} latent hyperprolactinemia is a, if not the major cause of premenstrual <b>mastodynia,</b> mastalgia and infertility due to insufficient function of the corpus luteum. It was therefore very early attempted to cure the painful breast sensations by drugs which inhibit pituitary prolactin release. Under physiologic conditions the biogenic amine dopamine inhibits pituitary prolactin release. This has led to development of synthetic drugs with dopaminergic activity which were all derivatives of ergot alkaloids. It became soon clear that decreased prolactin levels under treatment with the dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine ameliorated the severity of premenstrual <b>mastodynia,</b> an effect not seen in the placebo treated patients [3, 10]. Also, a study addressing the question whether the synthetic dopamine agonist lisuride ameliorates also other PMS symptoms yielded positive results [11]. But these systemic dopaminergic drugs had all severe side effects such as nausea and orthostatic dysregulation [12].|$|E
30|$|Taken {{together}} {{it appears}} now well established that prolactin is indeed involved in generation {{and promotion of}} breast cancer. This makes it highly likely that such cancers may be prevented and their progression slowed down by dopamine agonists. Particularly VAC extracts with their low side effects seem favorable {{for the prevention of}} breast cancer by reducing <b>mastodynia</b> and fibrocystic mastopathy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mastodynia</b> is {{correlated}} with the menstrual cycle. Using frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS), we investigated changes in breast perfusion in women who were or were not using hormonal contraception. Healthy volunteers, on or not on hormonal contraception, were examined. Optical properties were measured in all quadrants of both breasts, and physiological parameters were calculated. Measurements were repeated every other day during one complete menstrual cycle. Measurements were comparable in all quadrants. Data remained unchanged during the entire cycle in patients using hormonal contraception. However, a biphasic variation of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin (tHb), and water content (H(2) O) was observed in women not using contraception. tHb and H(2) O distinctly increased during the ovulation period and remained elevated throughout the luteal phase. It was concluded that FD-NIRS allows accurate measurement of optical properties of human breasts. As opposed to the menstrual cycles of persons using oral contraception, spontaneous menstrual cycles exhibit biphasic variations of tissue perfusion parameters. These findings are important for the investigation of <b>mastodynia...</b>|$|E
30|$|Despite {{small sample}} and often poorly defined patient populations sizes in most studies, randomised, {{controlled}} trials support the efficacy and tolerability of Vitex agnus-castus extracts {{in the treatment}} of premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> and mastalgia accompanied by latent hyperprolactinaemia and of fibrocystic mastopathy. Future investigations with Vitex agnus castus extracts would benefit from use of tightly defined patient populations and common endpoints.|$|E
30|$|In a large study, {{comprising}} 129 women, {{the effects}} of 40  mg dried VAC fruit on latent hyperprolactinemia in patients suffering from <b>mastodynia</b> were compared to those of a treatment with bromocriptine or Dostinex. The latent hyperprolactinemia was successfully treated, i.e. prolactin levels were normalized in all 3 treatment groups which caused cessation of the painful breast sensations. Interestingly mammary duct thickness was reduced by the 2 synthetic but not by the VAC preparation.|$|E
30|$|The {{issue of}} a {{relation}} between premenstrual symptoms, particularly of premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} VAC preparations was recently reviewed by van Die et al. [8]. This review lacks, however, a number of European, particularly East European studies. A wider review of placebo controlled studies utilizing VAC extract are shown in Table  2 a-c. In all, but one of a total of 21 well conducted, placebo- or comparator controlled clinical trials such effects were well documented.|$|E

40|$|Purpose A {{large number}} of {{medications}} have been implicated in the genesis of gynecomastia. However, gynecomastia is common in men, asymptomatic, increases with age, and {{is considered to be}} due to an increased estradiol/testosterone ratio. This complicates the interpretation of medication-related gynecomastia. Therefore, we have reviewed the liter-ature in order to assess the data relating gynecomastia onset with utilization of specific medications. Methods The literature was searched in PubMed and the Ovid/Medline databases from the 1946 to January 2015 with the search terminology of Bgynecomastia, drugs/ medications. ^ A few other articles were found and included. Results One hundred ten publications were reviewed. Sixty-three were single case reports. There were 24 population-based studies of which 8 were HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents. Among the case reports, 49 were for individual medications, and 2 were reports of antineoplastic or antiretroviral drug regimens. In the great majority, <b>mastodynia</b> with or without breast enlargement was present and referred to as gynecomastia. Generally, hormonal profiles could not ex-plain the breast enlargement. The pain/tenderness and breast enlargement resolved spontaneously over time. Conclusion Many different medications have been associated with the presence of Bgynecomastia. ^ Generally, it presents as a syndrome characterized by a single painful/tender breast (<b>mastodynia)</b> associated with breast enlargement and is tran-sient. We suggest that these cases be referred to as an acute gynecomastia syndrome. This syndrome also occurs indepen-dent of medication use. Thus, in an individual patient, whether it is medication induced often remains uncertain. The patho-genesis remains unknown...|$|E
30|$|From the women’s perspective, {{effective}} alternatives, particularly herbal medicines {{with fewer}} side effects are preferred [16] to treat PMS-related symptoms. Fruits of Vitex agnus-castus tree, {{also known as}} chasteberry, have traditionally been used [17] to treat minor symptoms related to the monthly pain, swelling, and mood disorders that are collectively termed PMS [2]. Standardized herbal extracts from Vitex agnus-castus fruits (VAC dry extracts) are recognized and sold in Europe as “well-established use” herbal medicinal products that are effective for relief of PMS with fewer side effects than NSAIDs. The efficacy and safety of VAC dry extracts in treating PMS symptoms such as irregular menstruation and breast pain (<b>mastodynia)</b> have been confirmed by several controlled clinical studies [18 – 21].|$|E

40|$|Gynecomastia and/or <b>mastodynia</b> is {{a common}} medical problem in {{patients}} receiving antiandrogen (bicalutamide or flutamide) treatment for prostate cancer; up to 70 % of these patients result to be affected; furthermore, this can jeopardise patients' quality of life. To systematically review the quality of evidence of the current literature regarding treatment options for bicalutamide-induced gynecomastia, including efficacy, safety and patients' quality of life. The PubMed, Medline, Scopus, The Cochrane Library and SveMed+ databases were systematically searched between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2014. All searches were undertaken between January and February 2015. The search phrase used was:"gynecomastia AND treatment AND prostate cancer". Two reviewers assessed 762 titles and abstracts identified. The search and review process was done {{in accordance with the}} PRISMA statement. The PICOS (patients, intervention, comparator, outcomes and study design) process was used to specify inclusion criteria. Quality of evidence was rated according to GRADE. Primary outcomes were: treatment effects, number of complications and side effects. Secondary outcome was: Quality of Life. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and are analysed in this review. Five studies reported pharmacological intervention with tamoxifen and/or anastrozole, either as prophylactic or therapeutic treatment. Four studies reported radiotherapy as prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Two studies compared pharmacological treatment to radiotherapy. Most of the studies were randomized with varying risk of bias. According to GRADE, quality of evidence was moderate to high. Bicalutamide-induced gynecomastia and/or <b>mastodynia</b> can effectively be managed by oral tamoxifen (10 - 20 mg daily) or radiotherapy without relevant side effects. Prophylaxis or therapeutic treatment with tamoxifen results to be more effective than radiotherapy...|$|E
30|$|The {{dried fruits}} of the chaste tree Vitex agnus castus (VAC) were {{traditionally}} used by monks {{as a substitute for}} pepper and was therefore also called Monk’s pepper. For the last 50  years it is commercially provided for the treatment of premenstrual symptoms, particularly to prevent premenstrual <b>mastodynia</b> (mastalgia). Most studies were performed with the preparation containing an aqueous/ethanolic ectract BNO 1095. A number of placebo controlled studies gave proof that extracts of VAC had beneficial effects on premenstrual breast pain. This breast sensation is induced by latent hyperprolactinemia which is characterized by secretory episodes of prolactin release by the pituitary in response to stress and deep sleep phases. This latent hyperprolactinemia induces also often a corpus luteum insufficiency which is a common reason for infertilty.|$|E
40|$|Background. Gynecomastia {{is treated}} {{when it is}} painful, there are psychosocial repercussions or it does not revert in less tan two years. It is treated with the antiestrogenic drug tamoxifen, but there are doubts about its {{effectiveness}} in high volume gynecomastias or in those lasting more than two years. Aim. To assess the effectiveness and safety of tamoxifen for gynecomastia {{and the influence of}} its volume and duration on the response to treatment. Patients and methods. Forty three patients with gynecomastia, aged 12 to 62 years, were studied. Twenty seven patients had a pubertal physiological gynecomastia, in eight it was caused by medications, in four it was secondary to hypogonadism, in three it was idiopathic and in one it was due to toxic exposure. Twenty patients had <b>mastodynia</b> and in 33, gynecomastia had a diameter over 4 cm. It lasted less than two years in 30 patients, more than two years in nine and four did not recall its duration. All were treated with tamoxifen 20 mg/dayfor 6 months. A follow up evaluation was performed at three and six months of treatment. Results. <b>Mastodynia</b> disappeared in all patients at three months. At six months gynecomastia disappeared in 26 patients (62 %), but relapsed in 27 %. All gynecomastias caused by drugs with antiandrogen activity disappeared. Fifty two percent of gynecomastias over 4 cm and 90 % of those of less than 4 cm in diameter disappeared (p< 0. 05). Fifty six percent of gynecomastias lasting more than two years and 70 % of those of a shorter duration disappeared (p=NS). Two patients had diarrhea or flushes associated to the therapy. Conclusions: Tamoxifen is safe and effective for the treatment of gynecomastia. Larger lesions have a lower response to treatmen...|$|E
