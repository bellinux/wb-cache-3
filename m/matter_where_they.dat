5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E

With this ruling, the United States became the 17th country to legalize same-sex marriages entirely.|$|E

25|$|Simple API for XML (SAX) is a lexical, {{event-driven}} API {{in which}} a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user's design. SAX is fast and efficient to implement, but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the XML, since it tends to burden the application author with keeping track of {{what part of the}} document is being processed. It is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> occur in the document.|$|E
25|$|On 9 November 2006, Mexico City's unicameral Legislative Assembly {{passed and}} {{approved}} (43–17) a bill legalizing same-sex civil unions, {{under the name}} Ley de Sociedades de Convivencia (Law for Co-existence Partnerships), which became effective on 16 March 2007. The law recognizes property and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. On 11 January 2007, the northern state of Coahuila, which borders Texas, passed a similar bill (20–13), under the name Pacto Civil de Solidaridad (Civil Pact of Solidarity). Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila, the state protects their rights no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> live in the country. Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo, Coahuila. Civil unions have been proposed in at least six states since 2006.|$|E
25|$|When {{the number}} of {{floaters}} rose 10.8 percent in 1990 to 2,654, FWP was forced to implement Stage 3 of the management plan in 1991. It limited float groups {{to no more than}} 15 individuals per group (including commercial outfitter staff), and required everyone—no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> put-in—to make a boat camp designation if they spent the night on the river. FWP also began charging both private and commercial floaters on the Smith River fees to obtain permits. These were the first user fees ever to be implemented on a state-owned or -managed river. Fees had not been mentioned in the 1986 Shouse study, but the idea had been broached by FWP officials during public hearings on the 1988 management plan. The Ad Hoc Committee discussed several alternative fee plans in 1990, and FWP had considered implementing fees that year. FWP surveyed roughly 280 former floaters, more than three-quarters of whom supported mandatory registration and permit fees. To assist the Forest Service in implementing its plans to protect the Smith River watershed, the FWP began remitting those fees paid by commercial outfitters to the Lewis & Clark National Forest. Income generated by user fees allowed FWP to hire a second river ranger to patrol the Smith, enforcing regulations, mediating conflict with landowners, maintaining boat camps, and picking up floater logs at Eden Bridge. This allowed the other ranger to remain at Camp Baker, collecting fees, issuing permits, handing out regulation pamphlets, and overseeing the campsite.|$|E

500|$|Between 1999 and 2003, to {{test the}} group's appeal across cultures, Warren used one of The Wiggles' CDs as an {{educational}} tool in a village near Madang, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. She found that the Madangese children were able {{to relate to the}} group's songs, and {{that they were able to}} sing along and participate in their simple choreography. [...] Although The Wiggles' recorded and performed songs, dances, and musical styles from different cultures and languages, The Wiggles did not find that adapting their music to non-Australian cultures was necessary to reach children in other countries. As Cook stated, [...] "...Toddlers don't have the same hang ups as adults". [...] The Wiggles recognised that as long as they spoke at the same level as their audience, their Australian accents would not matter, and that young children were able to adapt to a variety of contexts and to different pronunciations of common words, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> resided.|$|E
500|$|Partially in {{an effort}} to counter-act {{negative}} publicity from oil sands-related issues—for example, the March 2009 edition of National Geographic Magazine contained a 20-page article portraying Alberta's oil sands operations as being highly environmentally damaging—in 2009 Stelmach's government spent $25million on a rebranding campaign for the province. Among other things, it replaced the [...] "Alberta Advantage" [...] slogan that had long been in use with [...] "Alberta: Freedom to create. [...] Spirit to achieve." [...] The campaign became the subject of some ridicule when the Edmonton Journal revealed that one of the photos used in it was not taken in Alberta, but at a North Sea beach in Northumberland. While the government initially claimed that it had intentionally used a foreign image to represent Alberta's engagement with the world, it later admitted that this was not the case, and that the photo had been used in error. [...] Stelmach responded to the image, which showed two children running along a beach, by saying that [...] "children, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are around the world, they are the next generation. And air quality, water quality, no matter where we live on this big globe, we're all responsible, and that's the message we're trying to portray." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{also point}} out that proponents of the new {{calendar}} tend to use worldly rather than spiritual justification for changing the calendar: wanting to [...] "party with everyone else" [...] at Christmas; concern that the gradual shift in the Julian calendar will somehow negatively affect the celebration of feasts that are linked to the seasons of the year. However, opponents counter that the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the liturgical celebrations are no less valid. The validity of this argument is questionable, since the feasts of the Orthodox Church were not changed no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were celebrated, and Orthodox services were held in the southern hemisphere with little issue centuries before the introduction of the new calendar.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 January 2007, the Congress of the {{northern}} state of Coahuila legalized same-sex civil unions (by a 20–13 vote) under the name Pacto Civil de Solidaridad ("Civil Pact of Solidarity"; PCS), giving property and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. The PCS was proposed by congresswoman Julieta López of the centrist PRI, whose nineteen members voted for the law. Luis Alberto Mendoza, deputy of the center-right PAN (which opposed), said the new law was an [...] "attack against the family, which is society's natural group and is formed by {{a man and a}} woman". Apart from that, the PCS drew little opposition and was (notably) supported by Bishop Raúl Vera. Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila the state protects their rights (no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> live in Mexico). Twenty days after the law passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo, Coahuila.|$|E
2500|$|Preoccupation with Greater Somalia {{shaped the}} {{character}} of the country's newly formed institutions and led to the build-up of the Somali military in preparation for campaigns to retrieve Somali land. By law, the exact size of the National Assembly was not established in order to facilitate the inclusion of representatives of the contested areas after unification. The national flag also featured a five-pointed star, whose points represented areas traditionally inhabited by ethnic Somalis: the former Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, the Ogaden, French Somaliland, and the Northern Frontier District. Moreover, the preamble to the constitution approved in 1961 included the statement, [...] "The Somali Republic promotes by legal and peaceful means, the union of the territories." [...] The constitution also provided that all ethnic Somalis, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> resided, were citizens of the republic. The Somalis did not claim sovereignty over adjacent territories, but rather demanded that Somalis living in them be granted the right to self-determination. Somali leaders asserted that they would be satisfied only when their fellow Somalis outside the republic had the opportunity to decide for themselves what their status would be.|$|E

[...] Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in a televised statement that [...] "The toppling of a government that came into office through democratic elections, through methods that are not legal – and what is worse, through a military coup – is unacceptable, no matter what the reasons". Hüseyin Çelik, a spokesman for the governing Justice and Development Party and former cabinet member in the Erdoğan administration, condemned the ouster as a sign of [...] "backwardness" [...] and accused unnamed Western countries of supporting Morsi's overthrow.
