5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{service would}} have 16 weekly departures to Bergen Airport, Flesland. The main market segment is the {{offshore}} petroleum industry, and the departure times {{were designed to}} <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> helicopter routes to offshore installations. The company estimated that one-quarter of travellers would be people commuting to the North Sea. Norsk Hydro, who {{have a lot of}} employees in the Grenland area, stated that they could not start using Vildanden because they had an agreement with SAS Braathens' services from Sandefjord. The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers. This first month, 972 passengers took the plane, and Vildanden announced that they would try to also start a route to Stavanger Airport, Sola, as well as potentially to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} gives {{comparisons between}} several methods that solve the forward problem in MEEG by comparing their precision on a 3 -layer spherical model.

50|$|Crown gears or contrate gears are a {{particular}} form of bevel gear whose teeth project {{at right angles to}} the plane of the wheel; in their orientation the teeth resemble the points on a crown. A crown gear can only <b>mesh</b> accurately <b>with</b> another bevel gear, although crown gears are sometimes seen <b>meshing</b> <b>with</b> spur gears. A crown gear is also sometimes <b>meshed</b> <b>with</b> an escapement such as found in mechanical clocks.|$|R
5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost {{tens of millions of}} dollars, a Covenant campaign was never realized {{because of a lack of}} manpower and money.|$|E

50|$|Similar to {{boundary}} representation, {{the surface}} of the object is represented. However, rather than complex data structures and NURBS, a simple surface mesh of vertices and edges is used. Surface meshes can be structured (as in triangular meshes in STL files or quad <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> horizontal and vertical rings of quadrilaterals), or unstructured <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> randomly grouped triangles and higher level polygons.|$|R
40|$|We give {{improved}} deterministic algorithms for permutation routing and sorting on <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> {{row and column}} buses. Among our results, we {{obtain a}} fairly simple algorithm for permutation routing on two-dimensional <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> buses that achieves a running time of n + o(n) and a queue size of 2. We also describe an algorithm for routing on r-dimensional networks with a running time of (2 Γ 1 =r) n+ o(n) and a queue size of 2, and show how to obtain deterministic algorithms for sorting whose running times match those for permutation routing. An interesting feature of our algorithms {{is that they can}} be implemented {{on a wide variety of}} different models of <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> buses within the same bounds on time and queue size. Finally, we also study the performance of <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> buses on dynamic routing problems, and propose fast routing schemes under several different assumptions about the properties of the bus system...|$|R
25|$|Restrictions {{are imposed}} on who {{can become an}} DMOZ editor.

A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.|$|E
25|$|The Observatory offers {{opportunities}} for students of all ages to experience a range of science, technology, engineering and math topics, known as STEM education. Classes run through the school year, on weekends and school holidays at the facility in addition to bringing programs directly to schools for individual classrooms or the entire school.

25|$|Post-World War II {{construction}} projects included an entrance to Dallas from the north, and relocation {{of the main}} line across northern Arizona, between Seligman and Williams. In 1960, AT bought the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad (TP), then sold a half interest to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). TP cut straight east across Illinois from near Fort Madison, Iowa, to a connection with PRR at Effner, Indiana, forming a bypass around Chicago for traffic moving between the two lines. The TP route did not <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> the traffic pattern PRR successor Conrail developed after 1976, so AT bought back the other half, merged with TP in 1983, then sold it back into independence in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Toshio Masuda {{was born}} in Kobe, Japan. His father was a seaman. He {{enrolled}} in a technical training school, however, his mindset did not <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> the school's military indoctrination and he was expelled in July 1945. He next attended the Osaka University of Foreign Studies (now Osaka University) where he specialized in Russian literature. There he became enamoured with French cinema which led him away from Russian grammar and towards {{a career in the}} film industry. He thought he would have been bored as a salaryman and that filmmaking would better suit him but suggested he probably would not have followed through had his friends not sought similar careers. After graduating in 1949, he moved to Tokyo to study screenwriting at the Shintoho Studio's Scenario Academy.|$|E
25|$|The first grid is coarse mesh {{spanning}} the entire problem domain including the bath regions {{and the channel}} region. The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much finer mesh that spans a sub-domain of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore. The Poisson equation is first solved on the coarse <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> all the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, {{taking into account the}} applied bias. Next the boundary conditions for the secondary meshes are obtained by interpolating from the first or previous solutions of the Poisson equation. The Poisson equation is solved again for the finer meshes using the new boundary conditions. In this way, electrostatic fields with different mesh discretization for different regions can be generated.|$|E
25|$|That the Canberra was {{a foreign}} {{aircraft}} meant that its superiority {{in terms of}} performance did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E
