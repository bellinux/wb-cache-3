25|$|Neuroinflammation, {{which is}} a {{fundamental}} reaction to brain injury, {{is characterized by the}} activation of resident microglia and astrocytes and local expression {{of a wide range of}} inflammatory mediators. Acute and chronic neuroinflammation has been studied in the mouse brain following exposure to HZE. The acute effect of HZE is detectable at 6 and 9 Gy; no studies are available at lower doses. <b>Myeloid</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment appears by 6 months following exposure. The estimated RBE value of HZE irradiation for induction of an acute neuroinflammatory response is three compared to that of gamma irradiation. COX-2 pathways are implicated in neuroinflammatory processes that are caused by low-LET radiation. COX-2 up-regulation in irradiated microglia cells leads to prostaglandin E2 production, which appears to be responsible for radiation-induced gliosis (overproliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the CNS).|$|E

However, the participation of <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> in bioengineered vascular networks remains unclear. Therefore, we tested whether host <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a role in the}} formation of bioengineered vascular networks that occurs in vivo upon coimplantation of blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells and bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells, suspended as single cells in Matrigel, into immune-deficient mice.

Importantly, depletion of circulating <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> resulted in a significant reduction in microvessel density in the implants. In summary, the {{recruitment of}} <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> occurs rapidly after coimplantation of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells and is necessary for full vascularization in this model.

40|$|The role of <b>myeloid</b> derived {{suppressor}} <b>cells</b> (MDSCs) {{in promoting}} tumorigenesis is well-established, and significant effort {{is being made}} to further characterize surface markers on MDSCs both for better diagnosis and as potential targets for therapy. Here we show that the B cell receptor adaptor molecule CD 79 a is unexpectedly expressed on immature bone marrow <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells,</b> and is upregulated on MDSCs generated in multiple different mouse models of metastatic but not non-metastatic cancer. CD 79 a on MDSCs is upregulated and activated in response to soluble factors secreted by tumor cells. Activation of CD 79 a on mouse MDSCs, by crosslinking with a specific antibody, maintained their immature phenotype (CD 11 b+Gr 1 +), enhanced their migration, increased their suppressive effect on T cell proliferation, and increased secretion of pro-tumorigenic cytokines such as IL- 6 and CCL 22. Furthermore, crosslinking CD 79 a on <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> activated signaling through Syk, BLNK, ERK and STAT 3 phosphorylation. In vivo, CD 79 + <b>myeloid</b> <b>cells</b> showed enhanced ability to promote primary tumor growth and metastasis.
