Eight commercial and two experimental hybrids of pearl millet were evaluated for stover fodder quality traits and their potential trade-off with stover and grain yield. The stover quality traits analyzed were nitrogen, in vitro digestibility and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> content. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) variations were observed for grain yields (2860 to 4220 kg/ha), stover yields (range 3760 to 4930 kg/ha), stover nitrogen (0. 62 to 1. 10 %), stover in vitro digestibility (37. 6 to 46. 7 %) and stover <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (5. 26 to 6. 88 MJ/kg). Stover nitrogen content was negatively associated with grain and stover yield but no such trade-offs were observed between stover in vitro digestibility and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> contents on one hand and grain and stover yield on the other. Hybrid GK 1044 had the lowest stover nitrogen content (0. 62 %) and highest stover digestibility (46. 7 %) and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (6. 88 MJ/kg), while MLBH 267 with the highest stover nitrogen (1. 10 %) and the lowest stover digestibility (37. 6 %) and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (5. 26 MJ/kg). These two contrasting hybrids were re-planted on large plots in the second year and their stover tested in vivo with sheep as sole feed.

We carried out a systematic review aimed at answering three questions: how much milk is transferred from mother to infant?; does transfer increase with the age of the infant?; and what is the <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> content of breast milk? Thirty-three eligible studies of 1041 mother–infant pairs reported transfer at 3 – 4 months of age, the weighted mean transfer being 779 (SD 40) g/d. Six studies (99 pairs) measured transfer at 5 months, with a weighted mean transfer of 827 (SD 39) g/d. Five studies (72 pairs) measured milk transfer at 6 months, reporting a weighted mean transfer of 894 (SD 87) g/d. Nine longitudinal studies reported no significant increases in milk transfer after 2 – 4 months. Twenty-five studies on breast-milk energy content were based on 777 mother–infant pairs. The weighted mean <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> content was 2 · 6 (SD 0 · 2) kJ/g.

British Poultry Science, 49, (3), pp. 368 - 377 IMPF: 01. 13 RONO: 1320 58001. Naked oats belong to the same species as 'common oats', Avena sativa, but have a non-lignified husk which readily becomes detached during harvesting. The absence of the indigestible husk can be predicted to give an increased <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (ME) content for poultry. 2. Measurements of true <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (TMEN) were performed on 3 -week-old broiler chicks (Cobb males), adult cockerels (ISA Brown, greater than one year old) and 7 -week-old turkeys (BUT T 8 males). The measurements were repeated in 2000, 2001 and 2002, with some measurements on a subset of varieties in 2004. 3. High-oil naked oat lines yielded 12 % more energy (TMEN) than wheat. Naked oats, excluding the experimental high-oil lines, yielded 8 ? 5 % more energy than simultaneously assayed wheat samples. 4. In samples from the 2004 harvest, conventional oats gave TMEN values about 13 % lower than those of wheat. 5. The addition of ?-glucanase produced an increase of about 4 % in the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (AME) of oats for broiler chickens. This effect was associated with a 70 % decrease in the jejunal viscosity of broilers receiving a 500 g/kg naked-oat diet. 6. The oil content of naked oats was about 5 times greater than that of wheat, with the high-oil lines rising to more than 6 times greater. Naked oats had a lower starch content than wheat but not sufficiently lower to negate the energy benefits of the higher oil content. The crude protein (CP) contents of naked oats were similar to those of wheat, with the high-oil varieties tending to be higher in CP also. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In experiment 1, <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (ME) values were measured by both total collection and markers (chromic oxide) in excreta of 35 -d-old chicks. In experiment 2, ME values of the barley cultivars were determined by ileal digesta procedure. In experiment 3, 36 48 -d-old broiler chicks (used in experiment 1 and 2) were used to determine TME and the nitrogen corrected TME (TMEn) of the barley cultivars. Highly significant differences (P&lt; 0. 05) between bioassay methods were observed on average barley ME values. The average barley AMEn value measured by ileal digesta method was significantly (P&lt; 0. 05) higher than excreta (total collection and markers in excreta) (2716 Vs. 2318 and 2124 kcal/kg, respectively).

Across all grassland types, there were significant increases in acid detergent fibre, crude fibre and lignin content with increasing ozone concentration, resulting in decreased pasture quality in terms of the <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> content of the vegetation. We derived a dose-response function for <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> of the grassland with ozone concentration, applicable to a range of grassland types, and used this to predict effects on pasture quality of UK vegetation at 1 km resolution using modelled ozone data for 2007 and for predicted higher average ozone concentrations in 2020. This showed a potential total reduction in lamb production in the UK of approximately 4 % in 2020 compared to 2007. The largest impacts were in geographical areas of modest ozone increases between the two years, but where large numbers of lambs were present. For an individual farmer working to a very small cost margin this could represent a large reduction in profit, both in regions where the impacts per lamb and those where the impacts per km 2 of grazing land are largest. In the short term farmers could adapt their lamb management in response to changed forage quality by additional supplementary feed of high <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> content.

The growth rate coefficient of African Black Oystercatcher chicks was 2 % below the predicted value for a shorebird species of their body mass, but it was smaller than that of other precocial and semi-precocial shorebirds to date. Resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured through respirometry), daily <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (DME), defined as daily {{energy expenditure}} (DEE, measured with doubly labelled water) plus energy deposited into tissue (E-tis), and total <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (TME) of African Black Oystercatcher chicks were similar to those expected for a species of their body size. DEE was not influenced by weather (ambient temperature, operative temperature and wind speed), therefore, variations in DEE may be explained by body mass alone. The relative RMR of the African Black Oystercatcher was greater, their TME was approximately the same, their average daily <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (ADME) was less, and they spent less time foraging (short periods of parental feeding) and more time inactive than three precocial species in the Western Cape. Therefore, the semi-precocial mode of development of African Black Oystercatcher chicks reduced energy costs from thermoregulation and activity, and they were able to grow relatively faster than precocial, self-feeding shorebird species in similar climatic conditions. The growth rate coefficient of African Black Oystercatcher chicks was smaller than that of Eurasian Oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, chicks, which may be a consequence of differences in body size and latitudinal effects.

40|$|CSIRO 2014. Linear and {{non-linear}} {{models have}} been extensively utilised for the estimation of net and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> requirements and for the estimation of the efficiencies of utilising dietary energy for maintenance and tissue gain. In growing animals, biological principles imply that energy retention rate is non-linearly related to the energy intake level because successive increments in energy intake above maintenance result in diminishing returns for tissue energy accretion. Heat production in growing cattle has been traditionally described by logarithmic regression and exponential models. The objective {{of the present study}} was to develop Bayesian models of energy retention and heat production in growing cattle using parametric and non-parametric techniques. Parametric models were used to represent models traditionally employed to describe energy use in growing steers and heifers whereas the non-parametric approach was introduced to describe energy utilisation while accounting for non-linearities without specifying a particular functional form. The Bayesian framework was used to incorporate prior knowledge of bioenergetics on tissue retention and heat production and to estimate net and <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> requirements (NEM and MEM, respectively), and the partial efficiencies of utilising dietary <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> for maintenance (km) and tissue energy gain (kg). The database used for the study consisted of 719 records of indirect calorimetry on steers and non-pregnant, non-lactating heifers. The NEM was substantially larger in energy retention models (ranged from 0. 40 to 0. 50 MJ/kg BW 0. 75. day) than were NEM estimates from heat-production models (ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 49 MJ/kg BW 0. 75. day). Similarly, km was also larger in energy retention models than in heat production models. These differences are explained by the nature of y-intercepts (NEM) in these two models. Energy retention models estimate fasting catabolism as the y-intercept, while heat production models estimate fasting heat production. Conversely, MEM was virtually identical in all models and approximately equal to 0. 53 MJ/kg BW 0. 75. day in this database...|$|E

The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> and apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of faba beans, Australian sweet lupins, white lupins and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> values was observed only for faba beans and white lupins. Faba beans, white lupins and peas had comparable apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> values, but these values were higher than those of Australian sweet lupins, and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> values of faba beans and Australian sweet lupins, but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. African Grey Parrots are {{now being}} bred on a {{commercial}} scale in South Africa, mainly for the export market. In order to produce the best breeding results {{it is necessary to}} formulate balanced diets but no research has been done on the feeding value for African Grey parrots of ingredients used in formulating diets. Once the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (AME) of extruded maize for African Greys has been established {{it will be possible to}} calculate the AME of other ingredients such as full fat soya, soya oil cake or sunflower oil cake. By feeding an extruded mix containing a known amount of maize mixed with a known amount of soya oil cake and establishing experimentally the AME of the mix, the AME of soya oil cake for African Greys can be calculated by difference. This information will make it possible to decide whether AME results obtained for poultry can be used in formulating diets for African Grey parrots. The study consisted of two parts where the determination of the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (AME) of extruded maize and the practical application thereof in formulating parrot diets, and the economic viability of a commercial African Grey parrot breeding operation was investigated. A reference procedure adopted by several European laboratories for the in vivo determination of <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (ME) was used to determine the apparent <b>metabolisable</b> <b>energy</b> (AME) of extruded whole maize for African Grey parrots. The long term goal is to make a well balanced, extruded diet for these birds. Extruded maize is the form in which maize is generally included in commercial parrot diets and was therefore chosen as the experimental feed. Maize can be conveniently extruded with other single ingredients such as full fat soyabean meal, soyabean oil cake meal or sunflower oil cake meal to determine, by difference, the AME of those ingredients. For the first part of the study, ten, 3 -year-old African Grey parrots were individually housed and fed in cages designed to facilitate collection of the faeces. Cage design varied between a tall type (n= 6) and a low type (n= 4). The parrots were acclimatized to their new environment before the trial commenced to ensure normal feeding behaviour. The average AME value established for the ten African Grey Parrots was 16. 8 MJ/kg. In the trial it became apparent that it is very difficult to get consistent results with the cages used and a modified cage design is proposed for the future. The second part of the study investigated the economic viability of breeding African Grey parrots commercially, with extruded maize as part of their diet. It was generally concluded that the breeding of African Grey parrots for the pet market can be considered as an economical venture...|$|E
