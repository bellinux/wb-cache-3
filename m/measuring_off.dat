60|$|Here {{there was}} another long pause. Wallace {{was looking at the}} ladder. He {{observed}} how carefully Stuyvesant was making it. He saw that the cross-bars were all exactly of a length, and he knew that they must have been pretty accurately measured. While Wallace was looking on, Stuyvesant was <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> the distances upon the side pieces of the ladder, so as to have the steps of equal length. Wallace observed that he did this all very carefully.|$|E
60|$|At this suggestion, all the navigators {{assembled}} {{on board}} the Santa Maria, and each man made his calculations, sticking a pin in the rude chart--rude as to accuracy, but beautiful as to execution--that the admiral, with the lights he then possessed, had made of the Atlantic ocean. Vicente Yañez, and his companions of the Niña, placed their pin most in advance, after <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> four hundred and forty marine leagues from Gomera. Martin Alonzo varied a little from this, setting his pin some twenty leagues farther east. When it was the turn of Columbus, he stuck a pin twenty leagues still short of that of Martin Alonzo, his companions having, to all appearance, like less skilful calculators, thus much advanced ahead of their true distance. It was then determined {{what was to be}} stated to the crews, and the pilots returned to their respective vessels.|$|E
60|$|Pleasant as {{the task}} was at first, it ended painfully. Agnes Eden appeared, in order to claim the double portion allotted to her mother, as a widow. This {{was the first time}} that Mrs. Eden had asked for the gooding-money, and Lily knew that it was a sign that she must be in great distress. Agnes made her a little courtesy, and crept away again as soon as she had {{received}} her shilling; but Mrs. Grey, who was Mrs. Eden's neighbour, had not quite settled her penny-club affairs, and remained a little longer. An unassuming and lightly- principled person was Mrs. Grey, and Lily enjoyed a talk with her, while she was waiting for the purple stuff frock which Jane was <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> for Kezia. They spoke of the children, and of a few other little matters, and presently something was said about Mrs. Eden; Lily asked if the blacksmith helped her.|$|E

60|$|The {{truth of}} the case was, that the {{supposed}} leaning spire, which Rollo saw, was in reality a monstrous crane that was mounted {{on one of the}} towers of the celebrated unfinished cathedral at Cologne. This cathedral was commenced about six hundred years ago, and was meant to be the grandest edifice of the kind in the world. They laid out the plan of it five hundred feet long, and two hundred and fifty feet wide, and designed to carry up the towers and spires five hundred feet high. You can see now how long this church was to be by going out into the road, or to any other smooth and level place, and there <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> two hundred and fifty paces by walking. The pace--that is, the long step--of a boy of ten or twelve years old is probably about two feet. That of a full grown man is reckoned at three feet. So that by walking off, by long steps, till you have counted two hundred and fifty of them, you can see how long this church was to be; and then by turning a corner and measuring one hundred and twenty-five paces in a line at right angles to the first, you will see how wide it was to be. To walk entirely round such an area as this would be nearly a third of a mile.|$|E

"With labor--very hard labor, I should say--he {{struggled}} {{up through}} the stiff chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and {{in the bottom of}} it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of fuse--the barrel's distance {{from the back of the}} cabin. He bored a hole in the side of the barrel--here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the candle--timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening--which I am betting it was--and provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the fuse--which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the case." ...|$|E
6000|$|This second dream {{went back}} into the first somehow, and the other man in brown came {{threatening}} and shouting towards him. He grew uglier and uglier as he approached, and his expression was intolerably evil. He came and looked close into Mr. Hoopdriver's eyes and then receded to an incredible distance. His face seemed to be luminous. [...] "MISS BEAUMONT," [...] he said, and splashed up a spray of suspicion. Some one began letting off fireworks, chiefly Catherine wheels, down the shop, though Mr. Hoopdriver knew it was against the rules. For it seemed that the place they were in was a vast shop, and then Mr. Hoopdriver perceived that the other man in brown was the shop-walker, differing from most shop-walkers in {{the fact that he was}} lit from within as a Chinese lantern might be. And the customer Mr. Hoopdriver was going to serve was the Young Lady in Grey. Curious he hadn't noticed it before. She was in grey as usual,--rationals,--and she had her bicycle leaning against the counter. She smiled quite frankly at him, just as she had done when she had apologised for stopping him. And her form, as she leant towards him, was full of a sinuous grace he had never noticed before. [...] "What can I have the pleasure?" [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver at once, and she said, [...] "The Ripley road." [...] So he got out the Ripley road and unrolled it and showed it to her, and she said that would do very nicely, and kept on looking at him and smiling, and he began <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> eight miles by means of the yard measure on the counter, eight miles being a dress length, a rational dress length, that is; and then the other man in brown came up and wanted to interfere, and said Mr. Hoopdriver was a cad, besides measuring it off too slowly. And as Mr. Hoopdriver began to measure faster, the other man in brown said the Young Lady in Grey had been there long enough, and that he WAS her brother, or else she would not be travelling with him, and he suddenly whipped his arm about her waist and made off with her. It occurred to Mr. Hoopdriver even at the moment that this was scarcely brotherly behaviour. Of course it wasn't! The sight of the other man gripping her so familiarly enraged him frightfully; he leapt over the counter forthwith and gave chase. They ran round the shop and up an iron staircase into the Keep, and so out upon the Ripley road. For some time they kept dodging in and out of a wayside hotel with two front doors and an inn yard. The other man could not run very fast because he had hold of the Young Lady in Grey, but Mr. Hoopdriver was hampered by the absurd behaviour of his legs. They would not stretch out; they would keep going round and round as if they were on the treadles of a wheel, so that he made the smallest steps conceivable. This dream came to no crisis. The chase seemed to last an interminable time, and all kinds of people, heathkeepers, shopmen, policemen, the old man in the Keep, the angry man in drab, the barmaid at the Unicorn, men with flying-machines, people playing billiards in the doorways, silly, headless figures, stupid cocks and hens encumbered with parcels and umbrellas and waterproofs, people carrying bedroom candles, and such-like riffraff, kept getting in his way and annoying him, although he sounded his electric bell, and said, [...] "Wonderful, wonderful!" [...] at every corner....|$|E

5000|$|A {{great deal}} of African music is built upon a cycle of four main beats. This basic musical period has a bipartite structure; it {{is made up of}} two cells, {{consisting}} of two beats each. Ladzekpo states: [...] "The first most useful measure scheme consists of four main beats with each main beat <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> three equal pulsations [...] as its distinctive feature &hellip; The next most useful measure scheme consists of four main beats with each main beat flavored by <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> four equal pulsations [...]" [...] (b: [...] "Main Beat Schemes") The four-beat cycle is a shorter period than what is normally heard in European music. This accounts for the stereotype of African music as [...] "repetitive." [...] (Kubik, p. 41) A cycle of only two main beats, {{as in the case of}} 3:2, does not constitute a complete primary cycle. (Kubik, Vol. 2, p. 63) Within the primary cycle there are two cells of 3:2, or, a single cycle of six-against-four (6:4). The six cross-beats are represented below as quarter-notes for visual emphasis.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{fundamental}} cross-rhythm in Ewe music, and Sub-Saharan African music traditions in general, is three-against-two (3:2), or six-against-four (6:4), {{also known as}} a vertical hemiola. The cycle of two or four beats are the main beat scheme, while the triple beat scheme is secondary. Ladzekpo states: [...] "The term secondary beat scheme refers to a component beat scheme of a cross rhythm other than the main beat scheme. In a similar manner as a main beat, each secondary beat is distinguished by <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> a distinct number of pulsations. A recurrent grouping of a number of these beats in a musical period forms a distinct secondary beat scheme." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} Chinese bagua and {{the guardians of}} Jambudvipa in Indian culture, Malay astrology and geomancy also uses eight points of divination. Known as the [...] "eight beasts", each one {{corresponds}} to an animal possessing its own characteristics. The eight beasts regulate {{the length of a}} houses threshold. This is measured in a unit called depa, the length of the house-mistresss armspan. After <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> a depa on a piece of string, the string is folded into three before one-third of its length is cut off. The remainder is folded into eight and reduced to one-seventh. The remaining seventh is checked against the thresholds length, and the number of times it is contained therein determines which animal it corresponds to. If the measurement is unlucky, the threshold would be cut shorter. The ominous significance of the eight beasts is often illustrated in rhyme. An example, recorded by Walter William Skeat, reads as follows: ...|$|E
30|$|One {{result of}} the fact that aTNS {{students}} can operate fluently with composite units is that they can use composite units as a template for partitioning a whole into small numbers of equal parts. INS and eTNS students would, in contrast, attempt to equi-segment (Steffe, 2010 b) a fractional whole by making a guess as to the size of one segment and then using that segment as a template for <b>measuring</b> <b>off</b> further pieces. This generally results in slow and inaccurate partitioning operations. An aTNS student can mentally visualize a composite of continuous units, project that onto the unpartitioned whole, and then mentally adjust the sizes of the continuous units in the composite to get a much better initial estimation than an eTNS student would. This is called simultaneous partitioning (Hackenberg, Norton, & Wright, 2016; Steffe, 2010 b) because of the simultaneous awareness of all the partitions before the student acts on the visible whole.|$|E
