5|$|Some species make a {{hissing noise}} while other {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroach</b> produces its sound through the modified spiracles {{on the fourth}} abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced by adults and larger nymphs, and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroach</b> has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
500|$|Several {{cockroach}} species, such as Blaptica dubia, {{are raised}} as food for insectivorous pets. A few cockroach species are raised as pets, most commonly the giant <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroach,</b> Gromphadorhina portentosa. [...] Whilst the hissing cockroaches {{may be the}} most commonly kept species, there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts; there is even a specialist society: the Blattodea Culture Group (BCG), which was a thriving organisation for about 15 years although now appears to be dormant. [...] The BCG provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroaches which was otherwise limited to either scientific papers, or general insect books, or books covering a variety of exotic pets; {{in the absence of an}} inclusive book one member published Introduction to Rearing Cockroaches which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroaches.|$|E

50|$|Androlaelaps schaeferi ({{formerly}} {{known as}} Gromphadorholaelaps schaeferi) is a mite that {{lives on the}} <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Gromphadorhina portentosa).

They are usually concentrated between the host's legs and around the spiracles.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroach</b> {{was used}} by artist Garnet Hertz as the driver of a mobile robotic artwork.

Several domestic animals are used in public programs, including rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, and <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroaches.</b> One {{of the most popular}} domestic animals, Barney the Burmese python, was put down in December 2011 at over 26 years old.|$|R
50|$|A {{study found}} other {{cockroaches}} (Turkestan ("red runner") <b>cockroaches,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>cockroaches,)</b> provided a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, {{more so than}} mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R
