40|$|AbstractDrilling is an {{important}} process for making and assembling components made from Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP). Various processes like conventional drilling, vibration assisted drilling and ultrasonic assisted drilling have been attempted {{in order to maintain}} the integrity of the material and obtain the necessary accuracy in drilling of GFRP. This paper attempts to review the influence of machining parameter on the delamination damage of GFRP during drilling. In conventional <b>machining</b> <b>feed</b> rate, tool material and cutting speed are the most influential factor on the delamination hence machining at higher speed, harder tool material and lower feed rate have lesser delamination of the GFRP. Vibration assisted drilling and Ultrasonic assisted drilling have lesser thrust and hence lesser delamination compared to conventional drilling, which indicates that both vibration assisted drilling and Ultrasonic assisted drilling are more appropriate for drilling of GFRP...|$|E

40|$|Hydrostatic {{guideways}} {{are widely}} applied into precision and ultra-precision machine tools. Meanwhile, the oil film heat transfer causes thermal disturbance {{to the machine}} accuracy. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the mechanism of the oil film heat transfer and the heat-transfer-reducing method to improve the machine accuracy. This paper describes a comprehensive thermal finite element (FE) simulation modeling method for the hydrostatic <b>machine</b> <b>feed</b> platform to study methods of reducing machine thermal errors. First of all, the generating heat power of viscous hydraulic oil flowing between parallel planes is calculated based on the Bernoulli equation. This calculation is then employed for the simulation load calculations for the closed hydrostatic guideways, which is adopted by the hydrostatic <b>machine</b> <b>feed</b> platform. Especially, in these load calculations, the changing of oil film thickness (resulted from external loads) and the changing of oil dynamic viscosity (influenced by its temperature) are taken into account. Based on these loads, thermal FE simulation modeling of the hydrostatic <b>machine</b> <b>feed</b> platform is completed to predict and analyze its thermal characteristics. The reliability of this simulation modeling method is verified by experiments. The studies demonstrate that the hydrostatic machine thermal error degree is determined by the oil film heat transfer scale, and this scale is mainly influenced by the relative oil supply temperature to ambient temperature (quantitative comparison of oil supply temperature and ambient temperature). Furthermore, the reduction of the absolute value of this relative oil supply temperature can reduce the oil film heat transfer scale and improve the machine accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{instruments}} are inadequate for real time wear measurement in the uncertain environmental conditions of developing countries. A modeling approach relating relevant parameters causing wear on cutting tools ’ flank {{will be useful}} in predicting wear in machining operations. Mild steel turning experiment was carried out on the lathe using selected High Speed Steel (HSS) and High Carbon Steel (HCS) single point cutting tools. Speed, feed, and time of machining were varied accordingly, while running with, and without coolant. Hardness of the cutting tips of the tools was measured using Rockwell, R hardness tester. The corresponding speed, feed and time of machining were also noted. Turning operation was continued until the tool was totally blunt. At this stage recorded values of hardness, time of <b>machining,</b> <b>feed</b> and speed were modeled using multiple regression technique, with and without cutting fluid. The resulting models were strongly {{in agreement with the}} measured values. Therefore, the model is a good predictor of flank wear for the selected tools commonly used in developing countries.

40|$|International audienceHigh-speed {{machining}} of thin-walled structures {{is widely}} used in the aeronautical industry. Higher spindle speed and <b>machining</b> <b>feed</b> rate, combined with a greater depth of cut, increases the removal rate and with it, productivity. The combination of higher spindle speed and depth of cut makes instabilities (chatter) a far more significant concern. Chatter causes reduced surface quality and accelerated tool wear. Since chatter is so prevalent, traditional cutting parameters and processes are frequently rendered ineffective and inaccurate. For the machine tool to reach its full utility, the chatter vibrations must be identified and avoided. In order to avoid chatter and implement optimum cutting parameters, the machine tool including all components and the workpiece must be dynamically mapped to identify vibration characteristics. The aim of the presented work {{is to develop a}} model for the prediction of stability limits as a function of process parameters. The model consists of experimentally measured vibration properties of the spindle-tool, and finite element calculations of the workpiece in (three) different stages of the process. Commercial software packages used for integration into the model prove to accomplish demands for functionality and performance. A reference geometry that is typical for an aircraft detail is used for evaluation of the prediction methodology. In order to validate the model, the stability limits predicted by the use of numerical simulation are compared with the results based on the experimental work...|$|E

Despite the long history of design and developments of hole making tools, the modern twist drill, which undertakes most of the hole making tasks, is largely based on Morse’s geometrical design patented in 1863. however, considerable improvements in the technological performance of drilling operations as assessed by the forces, power, drill-life and hole quality have been achieved through the use of stronger and more wear resistant tool materials, better selection of the salient drill point features and improvements in drill manufacturing methods involving increased automation and geometrical control of drill variability. A variety of drill point modifications and designs have also been proposed and made commercially available although the modern conventional general purpose twist drill design still remains the standard product of drill manufacturers commonly available in stock. The improvement of the technological performance of twist drills has traditionally been the domain of the drill manufacturers who provide technical information and advice often in the form of <b>machining</b> <b>feed</b> and speed recommendations for use in practice.

Therefore {{it is important to}} maintain control ofones costs and keep calculations up-to-date. This thesis deals with cost accounting at a aluminium-processing company. The report focuses on calculating machine cost per hour since the manufacturing costs are the major part of the total product cost. Managers on the company believe that the costs they use in calculations todayneither is up-to-date nor advantageous in a market aspect and due to that their calculations need to be revised. The machines cost per hour is a major part in the manufacturing calculation. The company wants to provide a competitive price that also covers their costs. Therefore the company needs to control and specify their costs. The costs for the CNC-machines calculated in this thesis was considerablyhigher than the costs previously calculated for the company. It surprised thecompany managers that since the last calculation the used hours had increased by 15 %.
