40|$|Abstract Background The effects <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{preference}} and leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on cancer have been inconsistent. We {{examined the effects}} of dietary {{preference and}} physical activity, as well as their combined effect on cancer risk. Methods This prospective cohort study included 444, 963 men, older than 40 years, who participated in a national health examination program begun in 1996. Based on {{the answer to the question}} "What kind of dietary preference do you have?" we categorized dietary preference as (1) <b>vegetables,</b> (2) <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat, and (3) meats. We categorized LPA as low (Results During the 6 -year follow-up period, we identified 14, 109 cancer cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preference for <b>vegetables</b> or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat as opposed to a preference for meat played a significant protective role against lung cancer incidence (aRR, 0. 81; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 68 – 0. 98). Compared with the low LPA group, subjects with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk for stomach (aRR, 0. 91; 95 %CI, 0. 86 – 0. 98), lung (aRR, 0. 83; 95 %CI, 0. 75 – 0. 92), and liver (aRR, 0. 88; 95 %CI, 0. 81 – 0. 95) cancer. Among current smokers, the combined moderate-high LPA and <b>vegetable</b> or <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat preference group showed a 40 % reduced risk of lung cancer (aRR, 0. 60; 95 %CI, 0. 47 – 0. 76) compared with the combined low LPA and meat preference group. Among never/former smokers, subjects with moderate-high LPA and a preference for <b>vegetables</b> or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat showed reduced stomach cancer risk (aRR, 0. 72; 95 %CI, 0. 54 – 0. 95). Conclusion Our findings add to the evidence of the beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> preference on lung cancer risk and of physical activity on lung, stomach, and liver cancer risk. Additionally, vegetable preference combined with LPA might significantly reduce lung and stomach cancer risk. </p...|$|R

40|$|Vegetable oils, {{which are}} used as base oils for the {{production}} of environmentally friendly lubricants are triglycerides that make up the complex <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids with different chain length and number of double bonds. Triglycerides are rapidly biodegradable and have excellent lubricity properties. Advantages <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> oils compared to mineral are reflected in the following characteristics: toxicity, rapid biodegradability, good lubricity, high flash point, high viscosity index and low volatility. Disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> oils compared to mineral are: poor oxidative stability, poor flow ability at low temperatures and poor hydrolytic stability that limits their application.
