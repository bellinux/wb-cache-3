A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal.

In peatlands, organic matter decomposition in the acrotelm is accomplished primarily by fungi that act differentially through time on various peat constituents. After four months of decomposition in vitro, I show a distinct microbiological limitation to the decomposition of Sphagnum-derived peat (mean <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of 1. 1 – 7. 1 %) by indigenous and alien basidiomycetous fungi of both acrotelm and mesotelm peat (the mesotelm is {{the lower part of the}} acrotelm sensu lato, in which conditions fluctuate between oxic and anoxic). Neither acrotelm nor mesotelm Sphagnum peat can be degraded effectively by many fungi (mean <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of 2. 7 % and 4. 3 % for acrotelm and mesotelm peat, respectively), including the ubiquitous wood decomposing basidiomycetes known to decompose some of nature’s most complex polymers. Peatland basidiomycetes caused significantly greater <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of acrotelm and mesotelm peat than wood decay basidiomycetes (mean <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of 5. 7 % and 1. 4 %, respectively). Brown rot fungi caused significantly greater <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> to acrotelm and mesotelm peat than white rot fungi and non-wood-decay fungi (mean <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of 10. 1 %, 1. 7 %, and 2. 3 %, respectively).

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> in binary systems or <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical <b>mass</b> <b>loss,</b> were large-scale convection cells or polar <b>mass</b> <b>loss,</b> possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E

Therefore, the boards had good resistance against decay.|$|R

5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or <b>mass</b> <b>loss,</b> although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere), so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of <b>mass</b> <b>loss.</b> Models that have higher <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.|$|E

5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in <b>mass</b> <b>loss,</b> rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E

40|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of primitive life forms such as lichens and fungi can be based upon the formation of oxalates. These oxalates form as a film like deposit on rocks and other host matrices. The anhydrous oxalate mineral moolooite CuC 2 O 4 as the natural copper (II) oxalate mineral is a classic example. Another example of a natural oxalate is the mineral wheatleyite Na 2 Cu 2 +(C 2 O 4) 2. 2 H 2 O.

The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9.

One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star.

40|$|Food {{processors}} face increasing {{demands to}} improve their raw material yield efficiency. To really understand the raw material yield efficiency of food processing, <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> need to be divided in wanted (desired) and unwanted ones. The basic approach to increase the raw material yield efficiency is to mini mise unwanted <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> at source. Wasting raw materials should be avoided, because the largest proportion of the overall business costs {{is associated with the}} purchase of raw materials. This wasting will therefore put the company's pro fit under pressure. From a sustainability point of view, {{it is also important to}} transform raw materials efficiently into final products. There is an increasing interest to find appropriate measures to track the yield efficiency of food processes in order to guide organisational actions to reduce unwanted <b>mass</b> <b>losses.</b> Many unwanted <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> are hidden and need to be explored to make the management fully aware of these losses and the corresponding economic impact. Poor practice, poor maintenance, outdated equipment and technologies must first be visualised before they can be corrected. A new dimensionless number (called Yield Index) was developed to measure the true raw material yield efficiency of a transformation process. To measure the Yield Index, a food processor should measure the actual production yield and compare this with the maximum production yield. However, for many food processors the maximum production yield is unknown because of the lack of knowledge. With a systematic approach and considerable research effort it is possible to build a model that can predict the maximum production yield with respect to raw material parameters, additions and final product specifications. This model can then be used to pinpoint unwanted <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> in the production process. The thesis describes in a comprehensive way the development of two models to estimate the maximum production yield of French-fries production and poultry-processing (transforming broilers chickens into meat parts). These models were used in practice, to pinpoint unwanted <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> during processing and based on this knowledge, both processes were improved significantly. Based on these two practical case studies a general system approach was developed to implement production yield analysis (PY A) in other types of food processes. It was found that often a significant lack of knowledge in the true efficiency of the production processes exists. A PY A makes it possible to calculate the true yield efficiency of the process. This information is needed to convince management about the necessity to reduce unwanted losses. Not only to improve economics but also to improve aspects of modern sustainable food processing...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the star's diameter, questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The mass that makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed, and red supergiants are major contributors, yet {{the process by which}} mass is lost remain a mystery. With advances in interferometric methodologies, astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum. In July 2009, images released by the European Southern Observatory, taken by the ground-based Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), showed a vast plume of gas extending 30AU from the star into the surrounding atmosphere. This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse's surrounding atmosphere. Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse. Solving the mystery of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> in the late stages of a star's evolution may reveal those factors that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants.|$|E
