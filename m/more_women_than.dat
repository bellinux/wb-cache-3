40|$|Abstract: It {{is argued}} that, while men may be intrasexually <b>more</b> {{competitive}} <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> to attract potential mates, men will, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> associate with same-sex {{friends who are}} attractive to the opposite sex. Therefore, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> men will choose more physically attractive and dominant companions in a mating context than in a neutral context...|$|R
30|$|The other open {{question}} is why wage levels and returns to experience changed <b>more</b> for <b>women</b> <b>than</b> they did for men. Besides straight out discrimination, many other more readily quantifiable hypotheses can be considered. Changing occupational opportunities due to {{the rise in the}} service sector, changing educational investments pertaining <b>more</b> to <b>women</b> <b>than</b> men because of initial conditions are only a few avenues to be explored further.|$|R

The company preferred to employ and exploit the prisoner labor available from numerous Nazi labor camps and maintained by the SS, and became the third largest user of forced laborers in Germany. HASAG employed <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>than</b> men because the SS charged less for women. They worked more quickly than men and were more adaptable; they also had a lower mortality rate.|$|E

5000|$|Womb envy {{denotes the}} envy men may feel towards a woman's role in {{nurturing}} and sustaining life. In coining the term, the Neo-Freudian psychiatrist Karen Horney (1885-1952) proposed that men experience womb envy <b>more</b> powerfully <b>than</b> <b>women</b> experience penis envy, because [...] "men need to disparage <b>women</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> need to disparage men." [...] As a psychoanalyst, Horney considered womb envy a cultural, psychosocial tendency, like {{the concept of}} penis envy, rather than an innate male psychological trait.|$|R

Corbyn promoted a number of female backbench MPs to Shadow Cabinet roles, including Diane Abbott, Heidi Alexander and Lisa Nandy, making his the first Shadow Cabinet with <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>than</b> men, although the most senior roles went to men.|$|E
25|$|An ongoing {{issue in}} Canadian {{politics}} is the imbalance between the genders in selection by political parties of candidates. Although {{in the past}} some parties, particularly the New Democrats, {{have focused on the}} necessity of having equal gender representation in Parliament, no major party has ever nominated as many or <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>than</b> men in a given election. In 2006, the New Democrats had the highest percentage of female candidates (35.1%) of any party aside from the Animal Alliance, which only had one candidate, its leader, Liz White. The proportion of female New Democrats elected was greater than the proportion nominated, indicating female New Democrats were nominated in winnable ridings. 12.3% of Conservative candidates and 25.6% of Liberal candidates were female.|$|E
25|$|Based in {{a survey}} with about 10,000 respondents, IFOP {{estimated}} that 90% of French people are heterosexual, 3% identify as bisexual, and 4% consider themselves homosexual.

More singles than people in relationships identified as homo- or bisexual (11% v. 6%). An LGB identity is also more common among people who said they have had more than 10 sex partners or none at all compared to those who have had intermediary levels of sexual experience. Catholics are more likely to identify as heterosexual (91%) than people who said they had some other religion or no religion whatsoever (88% each).|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Dr. Fedigan {{set out to}} {{investigate}} {{whether or not there}} was a disproportionate number of females in primatology (relative to the other sciences) and if so, why? In her article [...] "Science and the Successful Female: Why There Are so Many Women Primatologists," [...] Fedigan's research confirms that there are significantly <b>more</b> <b>women</b> in primatology <b>than</b> in general biology and <b>more</b> <b>women</b> studying primates <b>than</b> other types of organisms. There are not, however, <b>more</b> <b>women</b> primatologists <b>than</b> there are <b>women</b> in the parental disciplines (anthropology, psychology and animal behaviour). She also notes that, in general, there has been a considerable increase in the number of women practitioners across a wide variety of life science disciplines.|$|R

However, if booty calls favour men <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> why might women {{be inclined to}} entertain calls for casual sex? Psychology professor Norman Li believes that booty calls should be looked upon as more than just sex; that it is, in fact, a strategy employed by both sexes in negotiating between their needs...|$|R
