In this paper the parameterization is theoretically motivated, confirmed to perform well {{for a wide range of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> depths, rotation rates, and vertical and horizontal stratifications. It is shown to be superior to alternative extant parameterizations of baroclinic instability for the problem of <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> restratification. Two companion papers discuss the numerical implementation and the climate impacts of this parameterization...|$|R
