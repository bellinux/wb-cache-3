5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of <b>multiple</b> <b>classification,</b> as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In <b>multiple</b> <b>classification</b> tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously.

The ICR system is based on prognostic indicators identified in IRSG I-IV. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma usually occurs in adults rather than children, and is therefor not included in this system. Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is also not included in this system due to its rare presentation and weak classification schema.|$|E

50|$|Classification {{within the}} Lauraceae {{is not fully}} resolved. <b>Multiple</b> <b>classification</b> schemes based {{on a variety of}} {{morphological}} and anatomical characteristics have been proposed, but none are fully accepted. According to Judd et al. (2007), the suprageneric classification proposed by van der Werff and Richter (1996) is currently the authority. However, due to an array of molecular and embryological evidence that disagrees with the groupings, it is not fully accepted by the scientific community. Their classification is based on inflorescence structure and wood and bark anatomy. It divides Lauraceae into two subfamilies, Cassythoideae and Lauroideae. The Cassythoideae comprise a single genus, Cassytha, and are defined by their herbaceous, parasitic habit. The Lauroideae are then divided into three tribes: Laureae, Perseeae, and Cryptocaryeae.|$|E
