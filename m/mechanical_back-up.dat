25|$|In 1985, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom teamed {{to develop}} a NATO {{battlefield}} transport and anti-ship/anti-submarine helicopter for the 1990s. The United Kingdom left the team in 1987. On 1 September 1992, NH Industries signed an NH90 design-and-development contract with NAHEMA (NATO Helicopter Management Agency). This agency represented the four participating nations: France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Portugal later joined the agency in June 2001. Design work on the helicopter started in 1993. The first prototype, PT1, made the type's first flight on 18 December 1995. The second prototype, PT2, first flew on 19 March 1997 and the third prototype, PT3, on 27 November 1998. On 12 December 2002, PT3 became the first helicopter to fly exclusively with fly-by-wire controls following the removal of <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up</b> controls.|$|E
5000|$|Continental Motors, Inc. of Mobile, Alabama, {{received}} on December 19, 2012 a type certification for its Continental CD-230 under the official TD-300-B designation: a turbocharged 4-stroke direct drive flat four air-cooled engine of 4972 cm3, with {{direct fuel injection}} and electronic control unit with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up,</b> outputting continuously [...] at 2200 RPM for 431 lb (195.5 kg) dry.

50|$|The 6TD-2 engine {{drives a}} French-designed hydro-mechanical {{automatic}} transmission, the SESM ESM500, {{which is also}} fitted to the Leclerc MBT. Capable of manual and fully automatic power-shifting, the transmission has 5 forward and 2 reverse speeds along with a braking system that incorporates carbon friction brakes and a secondary speed-retarding system. Gear changes are controlled by a torque converter which is made more efficient by addition of an automatic lock-up clutch. There is also a <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up</b> system for use in emergencies, able to shift 2 gears forward and reverse.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} named flight control laws, however {{alternate}} law {{consists of two}} modes, alternate law 1 and alternate law 2. Each of these modes have different sub modes: ground mode, flight mode and flare, plus a <b>back-up</b> <b>mechanical</b> law.|$|R
5000|$|Airbus and Boeing {{commercial}} airplanes {{differ in}} their approaches in using fly-by-wire systems. In Airbus airliners, the flight-envelope control system always retains ultimate flight control when flying under normal law, {{and it will not}} permit the pilots to fly outside these performance limits unless flying under alternate law. However, in the event of multiple failures of redundant computers, the A320 does have a <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up</b> system for its pitch trim and its rudder. The A340-600 has a purely electrical (not electronic) back-up rudder control system, and beginning with the new A380 airliner, all flight-control systems have back-up systems that are purely electrical {{through the use of a}} so-called [...] "three-axis Backup Control Module" [...] (BCM) ...|$|E

40|$|The actual {{trend in}} the {{transport}} industry is to have electronic systems without <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up,</b> so-called "bywire " systems. Micro-computers control steering, brakes, power train etc [...] . Robust protocols are needed to make these micro-computers communicate. They should be faulttolerant and yet not let the micro-computers split into disjoint communicating subsets. TTP is a time-triggered protocol that has been proposed for the automotive industry. In this paper we investigate the clique avoidance mechanism of TTP/C, the last version of TTP, and prove that it is effective. ...|$|E
50|$|An-178 is a high-wing {{transport}} aircraft with moderately swept wing, winglets and a T-tail. The airframe {{is made of}} aluminium alloys and composite materials. The fuselage is semi-monocoque with a circular cross-section. The retractable landing gear consists of two main wheel bogies and a dual nose wheel. The flight control system is dual duplex fly-by-wire system, consisting of two parts: FCS-A and FCS-B, {{each of which is}} responsible for two control channels. The flight control surfaces include ailerons near the wing tips, four control spoilers, six lift-dump/speed-brake spoilers, rudder and elevators, with an emergency <b>mechanical</b> cable <b>back-up</b> system. The powerplant consists of two Progress D-436-148FM turbofan engines, mounted on pylons under the wings and an auxiliary power unit. It can shift 18 tonnes over 1,000 km, or 10 tonnes over 4,000 km.|$|R
2500|$|SR22s and SR20s {{built before}} 2003 were {{equipped}} with traditional analog instruments and a 10" [...] Multi-function display (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display (PFD), making the plane {{the first of}} its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and helped pioneer the use of glass cockpits in the light general aviation industry. Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the instrument panels with one that includes the PFD, a new MFD and the installation of <b>back-up</b> <b>mechanical</b> instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Mobile Fighter G Gundam was {{produced}} by Sunrise in association with advertising agencies Sotsu and Dentsu, and toy company Bandai. The series was created to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Gundam franchise, created by Yoshiyuki Tomino in 1979. G Gundam was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, known {{for his work on}} the Giant Robo and Getter Robo Armageddon original video animations (OVAs). G Gundam was chiefly written and supervised by Fuyunori Gobu, a veteran screenwriter for various Sunrise properties such as Shippū! Iron Leaguer and The King of Braves GaoGaiGar. Many of the principal production crew members for G Gundam were carried over the previous season's Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, including character designer Hiroshi Ōsaka and mechanical designers Kunio Okawara and Hajime Katoki. Manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto collaborated on the show's character designs. Kimitoshi Yamane acted as a <b>back-up</b> <b>mechanical</b> designer and has since worked on Sunrise's acclaimed series Cowboy Bebop and The Vision of Escaflowne. Hirotoshi Sano, previously credited for Tekkaman Blade, was responsible for directing the mechanical animation in G Gundam, but also produced much of show's promotional artwork seen on home media covers. The musical score for G Gundam was composed by Kohei Tanaka. The opening theme song [...] "Flying in the Sky" [...] performed by Hitofumi Ushima and the closing theme [...] "Umi Yori mo Fukaku" [...] ("Deeper Than The Ocean") by Etsuko Sai are played for the first 25 episodes of the series. The opening theme [...] "Trust You Forever" [...] by Ushima and the closing theme [...] "Kimi no Naka no Eien" [...] ("The Eternity in You") by Takehide Inoue are played for the remaining episodes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: TTP/C, which {{represents}} one {{variant of the}} Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP), is designed to address safety-critical real-time control systems in the automotive sector. Of high interest in analyzing TTP/C, given its emphasis on “x-by-wire ” environments wherein electronic control systems do not have hydraulic or <b>mechanical</b> <b>back-up</b> components, are the aspects of the TTP/C protocol and architecture which concern themselves with reliability and fault tolerance. In this paper, the authors briefly discuss the key safety-related constructs of TTP/C. An experimental project in which a TTP/Cbased braking system was simulated in software, with particular emphasis {{on the behavior of}} the “bus guardian, ” is then described and analyzed. The sections of this report cover the following topics: (1) description of the requirements of the SAE Class C specification for safety-critical systems; (2) overview of the reliability related aspects of the TTP/C protocol and architecture, including the bus guardian; (3) summary of modeling and simulation work in TTP/C reported in the literature; (4) description of the objectives and approaches of the modeling and simulation work conducted in this project; (5) opportunities for future investigation, and (6) summary and conclusions...|$|E
