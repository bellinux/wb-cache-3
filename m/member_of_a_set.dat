25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging all the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are selections <b>of</b> some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element <b>set.</b> <b>As</b> another example, <b>an</b> anagram <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word, all <b>of</b> whose letters are different, is <b>a</b> permutation <b>of</b> its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is <b>a</b> reordering <b>of</b> the letters.
