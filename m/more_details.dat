5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity.

5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing.

The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. <b>More</b> <b>details</b> are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E

In addition, <b>more</b> <b>details</b> were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E
