25|$|Late medieval <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare</b> {{was divided}} in two {{distinct}} regions. In the Mediterranean galleys {{were used for}} raiding along coasts, and in the constant fighting for naval bases. In the Atlantic and Baltic there was greater focus on sailing ships that were used mostly for troop transport, with galleys providing fighting support. Galleys were still widely used {{in the north and}} were the most numerous warships used by Mediterranean powers with interests in the north, especially the French and Iberian kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|The squadron's first {{training}} courses began in January 1977. As {{part of the}} conversion {{training courses}}, students travel to various Australian Defence Force bases to build their familiarity with the ADF's <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare</b> capabilities and doctrine and participate in exercises in Australia and allied countries in the Pacific region. Students also take part in operational search and rescue and fishery surveillance flights. After completing their training with No. 292 Squadron, aircrew are posted to either No. 10 or No. 11 Squadron. As all the RAAF's Orions are pooled across No. 92 Wing's three flying units, No. 292 Squadron shares its aircraft with the two operational squadrons.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{crippling}} to the Canadian war effort, {{given the}} country's rail network {{to the east}} coast ports, but possibly more destructive to {{the morale of the}} Canadian public, was the Battle of the St. Lawrence, when U-boats began to venture upriver and attack domestic coastal shipping along Canada's east coast in the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence from early 1942 through {{to the end of the}} shipping season in late 1944. From a German perspective this area contained most of the military assets in North America that could realistically be targeted for attack, and therefore the St. Lawrence was the only zone that saw consistent warfare—albeit on a limited scale—in North America during World War II. Residents along the Gaspé coast and the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence were startled at the sight of <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare</b> off their shores, with ships on fire and explosions rattling their communities, while bodies and debris floated ashore. The number of military losses is not known, although loose estimates can be made based on the number of surface units and submarines sunk.|$|E

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] US Navy is at a critical juncture in determining the types and numbers of ships it will acquire, retire, and sustain to support an evolving US military strategy. In addition to determining how many aircraft carriers, cruisers, amphibious assault craft, fighters, and helicopters it will need, the Navy must determine how it will confront <b>maritime</b> irregular <b>warfare.</b> Assuming an environment of resource scarcity, where new vessel acquisition to support <b>maritime</b> irregular <b>warfare</b> may be increasingly difficult or unlikely, we introduce a method for evaluating the capability and costs of candidate vessels {{that are in the}} current Department of Defense inventory, or widely available from the commercial sector to conduct such a mission.

500|$|Hardman {{made two}} major {{changes to the}} {{structure}} of the Air Force to streamline command and control: integrating RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, [...] with the Department of Air, and supplanting the geographical area commands with three functional organisations, namely Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The functional command system has been described by historian Alan Stephens as Hardman's [...] "major legacy to the RAAF". While doing away with the area command structure that had been favoured by Jones, Hardman carried on his predecessor's support for the local aircraft industry. He also formed a policy agreement with the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Sir John Collins, covering joint responsibility and cooperation for <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare.</b> During Hardman's term as CAS, No.78 (Fighter) Wing was re-equipped with RAF deHavilland Vampire jet fighters to garrison Malta and support British operations in the Mediterranean. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 5June 1952, and raised to substantive air marshal on 1July.|$|E

2500|$|During 1941, Hitler {{decided that}} the Brest Group should return to home waters in a [...] "surprise break through the Channel", {{as part of a}} plan to thwart a British {{invasion}} of Norway. OKM preferred the Denmark Strait passage to Germany and Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder called a journey along the English Channel impossible. Hitler said that the break-out should be planned with no training period, since British intelligence was bound to find out and have the ships bombed. Hitler ordered that a period of bad weather should be chosen, when the bulk of the RAF would be grounded. Vizeadmiral (vice admiral) Kurt Fricke (Chief of Staff of the Seekriegsleitung SKL, <b>Maritime</b> <b>Warfare</b> Command) opposed Hitler but was allowed only a short time to review the policy. On 12 January 1942, Raeder again opposed the channel route but planned for it, provided that Hitler took the final decision.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{gradually}} {{and almost}} imperceptibly {{a state of}} <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare</b> {{grew up in the}} waters of the West Indies between Spain and the beef-traders of other nations; and from being obliged to fight, the buccaneers became glad to fight, provided that it was Spain they fought. True to her policy of despotism and cruelty when dealing with her American possessions, Spain waged a bitter and bloody war against the buccaneers who dared to interfere with the commercial relations between herself and her West India colonies, and in return, the buccaneers were just as bitter and savage in their warfare against Spain. From defending themselves against Spanish attacks, they began to attack Spaniards whenever there was any chance of success, at first only upon the sea, but afterwards on land. The cruelty and ferocity of Spanish rule had brought them into existence, and it was against Spain and her possessions that the cruelty and ferocity which she had taught them were now directed.|$|E
6000|$|Not until October of that year, 1775, was {{the infant}} navy born. Mr. Carvel was {{occupied}} in the interval in the acquirement of practical seamanship {{and the theory}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>warfare</b> under the most competent of instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon {{the character of that}} hero by the fact that, with all his supreme confidence in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first lieutenancy. This was in deference to the older men before that body. [...] "I hoped," [...] said he, [...] "in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from those of more experience than myself." [...] His lack of assertion for once cost him dear. He sailed on the New Providence expedition under Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon discovered that, instead of gaining information, he was obliged to inform others. He trained the men so thoroughly {{in the use of the}} great guns [...] "that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as soldiers generally perform the manual exercise." ...|$|E
