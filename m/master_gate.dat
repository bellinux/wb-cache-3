One hundred men and women had been sent by the Union Science Bureau on a one-way mission to close all the Gates, lest humanity suffer the fate of another species. The qujal had found the Gates and tapped their powers to rule an interstellar empire of lesser beings, including humans. But one reckless fool had succumbed to temptation and gone back in time, triggering a cataclysm that had wrecked qujal civilization.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly {{cropping}} the grass at his <b>master's</b> <b>gate.</b> Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about {{the banks of the}} brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.|$|R

Both of them were Head <b>masters</b> of <b>Gate</b> High School. During their regime, Gate High School became a premier institution of our state. Manik Chand Bhattacharjee was a scholar who inspired to fight against the evils prevailing in the society. He also gave patronage to his disciples from the displeasures of British officers. British officers posted here in those days were afraid of facing them. He remained source of inspiration for so many students who remained on top of glory, and served here as well as abroad.|$|R
30|$|If {{the system}} is subject to known {{dissipation}} and decoherence mechanisms, the quantum system evolution may be modeled theoretically and the process matrix be calculated by solution of the quantum <b>master</b> equation. A <b>gate</b> operation typically involves application of time dependent laser pulses. Therefore, it is valuable to determine how losses and errors accumulate and contribute to different types of errors in the output. To theoretically characterize a complete quantum circuit is a formidable task and is ultimately at odds with using a physical system to solve computationally hard problems. Still, a theoretical analysis of how errors propagate and accumulate in small systems may guide efforts to pick among different implementations of gates and assess optimal strategies for error correction. Such detailed studies may also serve to confirm the values of experimental parameters [23, 24].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of the efficiency of power-gating for clock storage elements (CSE) is presented. Two CSE topologies: the TGMS (Transmission <b>Gate</b> <b>Master</b> Slave) and the WPMS (Write Port Master Slave) are examined along with their respective circuits with sleep transistors. In this work, we study the benefits of adding sleep transistors coupled with regular clock-gating during inactive mode. We examine the energy savings for standard clock gated CSEs versus their power gated counterparts. This is done by studying how the leakage energy saved with power gating offsets the energy consumed by the extra transistors added to support it. It is not always beneficial to add sleep transistors when deciding between power-gating or just using clock-gating. We also study how the results and tradeoff change with voltage scaling.

5000|$|Much of the city's more exclusive, {{high-end}} neighborhoods lie {{among the}} elevated hills and mesas {{to capture the}} scenic views of the area {{that comes with a}} price. One such neighborhood is Stone Cliff, a high-end <b>master</b> planned <b>gated</b> community of multimillion-dollar estates perched on a hillside overlooking downtown and the valley from the southeast. Sun River, in the far southwest part of the city, is Utah's first and only active adult master planned retirement community offering golfing and resort-style amenities. New subdivisions in the far southern reaches of the valley such as Desert's Edge are popping up in remote territory along Southern Parkway, south of the regional airport. This area city planners and organizers refer to as the 'South Block', a section of vast open desert lands within city limits straddling the Arizona border proposed for future urban development. Most of the remaining agricultural areas exist primarily in the open-spaced southeastern parts of the city also known as Washington Fields and Little Valley. The Dixie Downs neighborhood in the northwest part of town, is named for an old horse race track that once existed near what is now the intersection of Dixie Downs Road and Snow Canyon Parkway. It's a densely developed area of mixed low to mid-income housing and projects. Dixie Downs is notable for being the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the city and is home to the first dual-language immersion public school in the Washington County School District.|$|R
50|$|San Joaquin Hills is an {{affluent}} guard <b>gated</b> <b>master</b> planned {{community in the}} city of Laguna Niguel, California in the San Joaquin Hills of Orange County, California. The community is set in the northernmost foothills of the city of Laguna Niguel, and construction began in 1997 after a 1994 approval from the city council to construct the development. It is composed of four notable community subdivisions, or enclaves of smaller subdivisional units. Each neighborhood within San Joaquin Hills has about 250 homes within its limits, and parks, as well as a community recreation and pool. There are a total of 910 homes in the development, and an estimated population of around 2,750 residents. It maintains its own Community Association, which maintains all the community centers and pools, as well as the landscaping. There are two entrances into the development from two separate gates. Its general boundaries begin at the Moulton Parkway and Aliso Creek Road intersection.|$|R

The 36 acre prison camp was located between what are now 19 th and 22 nd Streets, and between Central Avenue and Talbott Street. The land had been established as state fairgrounds. In 1861 it was converted to a military training camp, and named after the governor. In 1862 the facilities were used to house Confederate prisoners of war. Approximately 4, 000 prisoners arrived in February of that year. In the summer of 1864 the prisoner population reached nearly 5, 000. Weary of fighting many took the oath of allegiance to the United States Constitution and to the Union according to Lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction of 8 December 1863. On 1 April 1865 1, 408 prisoners were at the camp. In June 1865 {{the last of the}} Confederate prisoners were released.

40|$|Since 1996 (in {{the shadow}} of the reforms of the {{wildlife}} management) numerous hunting concessions were created in Burkina Faso. These concessions function as buffer zones for the nature reserves on the one hand, and contribute to the valorization of the wildlife dedicated to the sustainable development of the country on the other hand. The Burkinabe state, influenced by international environmental politics, aspires to make hunting the principal national revenue, thereby replacing cotton. In 1997, dozens of villages were moved from the northern periphery of park W (at the Burkina side), to give way to a hunting zone, attributed by the state to a private owner. Since then, the application of the forestry code, which regulates the access and utilisation of wildlife and other natural resources on a monetary base, is reinforced. Infractions are prevalent and frequently sanctioned in a repressive manner. This provokes a lot of tensions between the different actors, who have different stakes concerning the natural resources and display different strategies in the local arena of environmental politics. In my presentation, I will deal with one of these strategic actors of this local arena: the pisteur. The different functions, strategies and perceptions of the pisteur will be discussed. Pisteurs are local “hunters” with a thorough knowledge of the bush in the protected areas (the park and the hunting zone). The Forestry Service uses them as messenger boys to search and signal poachers, herders who enter in the nature reserves with their cows, wood cutters or producers of charcoal who operate illegally. Meanwhile, the skills of the pisteurs or ‘trackers’ are drawn on by the hunting concessionary for tracing wild animals, which guarantee trophies for the tourists. In this way, pisteurs are the intermediaries between the world of the foresters (national), the world of the villagers (local), and the western world (global), or the embodiment of the interface of local, national and global environmental politics. The pisteur has different faces and his level of success depends on the way he manoeuvres in this interface. He primarily tries to make a living in the new eco-era and <b>masters</b> the <b>gates</b> of what is shown to the outside world (to the foresters and the tourists). The pisteur builds up respect through exhibiting a kind of modern identity, often with a military touch, in line with the image of the forester or uniformed state servant. But at the same time, he is looked down upon by the foresters because of his ascribed quality of being a ‘bushman’ or villager. status: publishe...|$|R
