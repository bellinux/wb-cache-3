40|$|A {{microgrid}} is an eco-friendly {{power system}} because renewable sources {{are used as}} <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> In the islanded operation mode of a microgrid, maintaining the balance between power supply and power demand {{is a very important}} problem. In the case of surplus supply, decreased generation output and/or charge of distributed storages can be applied to solve the imbalance between power supply and demand. In the case of supply shortages, increased generation output and/or discharge of distributed storages can be applied. Especially in the case of critical supply shortages, load shedding should be applied. In a distributed load-shedding approach, microgrid components need to make decisions autonomously. For autonomous microgrid operation, a multi-agent system has been investigated. In this paper, a distributed load-shedding system for agent-based autonomous operation of a microgrid is designed.

Under this circumstance, at least one DG needs to be scheduled on all the time. When the wind is insufficient, the BESS is preferred to supply the load, and then increasing the power outputs of the operating DGs is considered as well as starting a new DG. If all these measures fail to meet the overall demands, a part of the load will be cut to ensure the power balance, referred to the unmet load. When the wind is abundant, some DGs are considered to be shut down, and the BESS may be charged by the excess wind power. The dump load may be activated in terms of the excess renewable energy as well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} {{algorithm}} and architecture co-design {{is presented in}} this paper for realizing a lowpower H. 264 encoder. At first, the three-level memory hierarchy of a video coding system was shown for <b>power</b> analysis. The <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> of a chip are data processing power and memory access power. Power reduction techniques on the algorithm-level and architecture-level should co-operate to minimize power consumption. Hardware-oriented fast algorithms are used to not only reduce data processing and memory access power but also maintain hardware efficiency. Data Reuse (DR) techniques are introduced to further save memory access power. In order to enhance power efficiency, a flexible system architecture is proposed to effectively integrate the fast algorithms and the modulelevel gated clock technique into the hardware architecture. As a result, the proposed H. 264 encoder achieves 14. 27 mW power consumption in CIF 30 fps videos. Due to the low-power characteristic, this design is suitable for power-limited mobile applications. Finally, the concept of algorithm and architecture co-design is not limited in the proposed design and beneficial for lowpower optimization in other video coding systems. ...|$|R

We detect Ly-alpha emission from both sources and so confirm that these Ly-alpha emitter candidates are physically associated with the BRI 1202 - 0725 system. We also report the lack of detection of any high ionisation emission lines (N V, Si IV, C IV and He II) and find that these systems are likely not photoionised by the quasar, leaving in situ star formation as the <b>main</b> <b>powering</b> <b>source</b> of these LAEs. We also find that both LAEs have Ly-alpha emission much broader (1300 km/s) than the [CII] emission and broader than most LAEs. In addition, both LAEs have roughly symmetric Ly-alpha profiles implying that both systems are within the HII sphere produced by the quasar. This {{is the first time}} that the proximity zone of a quasar is probed by exploiting nearby Ly-alpha emitters. We discuss the observational properties of these galaxies in the context of recent galaxy formation models. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
