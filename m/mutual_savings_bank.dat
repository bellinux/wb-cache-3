40|$|Deregulation {{during the}} 1980 s allowed {{savings and loan}} {{associations}} to undertake {{many of the same}} activities as <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> so that competition among thrifts increased, and they became more homogeneous in nature. At the same time, according to agency theory, mutual institutions should experience less efficient operations than stock institutions due to differences in monitoring and compensation of management. The purpose of this study, then, is two fold: first, to determine whether <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> exhibit the same cost behaviour as savings and loans; and second, to determine whether mutual institutions are less cost efficient than stock institutions. To compare cost structures and cost efficiencies, a three input, three output, translog cost frontier is estimated for <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> <b>mutual</b> S&Ls, and stock S&Ls. Approximately 1500 observations, restricted to the states in which <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> are chartered, are extracted from the 1990 OTS data {{to be used in the}} estimation. Each type of institution is found to have a unique cost function. The data are then used in a second regression to determine which characteristics are correlated with the inefficiency scores. It appears that <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> do have a different cost structure than savings and loans. As well, the comparison of stock versus <b>mutual</b> <b>savings</b> and loans reveals that mutuals exhibit cost efficiency, a result that contradicts agency theory. ...|$|R
