25|$|In the 2000s {{bands and}} artists {{appeared}} who functioned as cross-over acts between the indie rock and folk scenes. Their music often utilised traditional instruments, sometimes beside electronic music.

Ronald Wingate entertained Dmitri when he passed through Najaf.

25|$|The {{location}} of Gravesend is {{at a point}} where the higher land – the lowest point of the dip slope of the North Downs – reaches the river bank. To the east are the low-lying Shorne Marshes; to the west, beyond Northfleet and the Swanscombe Marshes. The settlement thus established because it was a good landing place: it was also sheltered by the prominent height of what is now called Windmill Hill (see Landmarks below); although Windmill Hill still remains a dominant feature, Gravesend's highest point is actually further inland at <b>Marling</b> Cross, adjacent to the A2.|$|E

25|$|The peak of {{traditional}} English folk, like progressive and electric folk, was the mid- to late-1970s, when, {{for a time}} it threatened to break through into the mainstream. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, it was in decline. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura <b>Marling</b> and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with acoustic performance {{of traditional}} material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England today as it has been for over thirty years.|$|E

5000|$|Like <b>Marling's</b> {{previous}} four records, Short Movie {{has achieved}} critical acclaim, despite achieving a less unanimously positive reception than Once I Was An Eagle. On review collation site, Metacritic, the record has an aggregate score of 81 based upon 28 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Helen Brown said, [...] "No doubts about this: Short Movie is a masterpiece," [...] and awarded the album a full five stars.

Sarah Greene of Exclaim! praised <b>Marling's</b> songwriting, writing that [...] "her bold statements and revelations seem more grounded {{in real life}} observations this time around, less in archetypes."

500|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{farmland}} was run {{through an open}} field system, which were commonly overstocked and made trying experimental methods very difficult; enclosed farms, on the other hand, were higher quality and useful for experimentation, {{with the result that}} they commanded a rent almost double a similarly sized open field. Compounding this problem, many of the enclosures were split up into strips, with the result that ownership was unclear. Between 1776 and 1816, Coke rapidly bought strips of land near his estates and had them enclosed. Much of this came during the Napoleonic Wars, where grain prices (and therefore farming profits) peaked. Coke was influenced by [...] "Turnip" [...] Townshend, who had owned a nearby estate who promoted crop rotation and farm improvement. Along with enclosure, <b>marling</b> and improved grasses, Townshend's improvements resulted in [...] "a course of husbandry utterly unlike that practised a hundred years ago".|$|E

Cave described the band as a [...] "weekend project", and one of many groups which they were involved in while at school. Fear of Flying completed one UK tour as a support act, as well as further slots with The Maccabees, Jamie T and Laura <b>Marling.</b> They released two double A-side vinyl singles on independent record label Young and Lost Club, [...] "Routemaster/Round Three" [...] on 7 August 2006 and [...] "Three's a Crowd/Forget-Me-Nots" [...] on 6 December 2006.

500|$|Critics {{have focused}} on the {{parallels}} between E.T.'s life and Elliott, who is [...] "alienated" [...] by the loss of his father. A.O. Scott of [...] The New York Times wrote that while E.T. [...] "is the more obvious and desperate foundling", Elliott [...] "suffers in his own way from the want of a home". E.T. is the first and last letter of Elliott's name. At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan {{from the perspective of a}} Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland's pirates. Vincent Canby of The New York Times similarly observed that the film [...] "freely recycles elements from [...] Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz". Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, [...] "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have come out of a Raymond Carver story." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote, [...] "Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann <b>Marling</b> called 'the marks of hard use'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Up to this time, the German-speaking {{population}} {{had not been}} subjected to violence and nor had the Italian authorities interfered with its cultural activities, traditions and schooling. This {{was about to change}} with the rise of fascism. The first hint {{of what was to come}} was experienced by the German population on Sunday April 24, 1921. The population of Bolzano-Bozen had organized a Trachtenumzug (a procession in traditional local costume) to celebrate the opening of the spring trade fair. The General Civil Commissioner of the province, Luigi Credaro, had been warned in advance by his colleagues from Mantua, Brescia, Verona and Vicenza of the intention of the fascists there to go to Bolzano-Bozen to disrupt the procession, but did not take any precautions. After arriving by train in Bolzano-Bozen the approximately 280 out-of-province fascists were joined by about 120 from Bolzano-Bozen, and proceeded to attack the procession with clubs, pistols and hand grenades. The teacher Franz Innerhofer from <b>Marling</b> was shot dead and around 50 people injured in the attack. After the attack the military intervened and escorted the fascists back to the station. Although Credaro, under orders from the Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, had two suspects in Innerhofer's murder arrested, nobody was brought to justice for the attack, as Benito Mussolini had threatened to come to Bolzano-Bozen with 2,000 fascists to free the two suspects by force if they were not set free immediately.
