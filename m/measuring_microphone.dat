50|$|All multi-driver {{speakers}} (unless {{they are}} coaxial) {{are difficult to}} measure correctly if the <b>measuring</b> <b>microphone</b> is placed close to the loudspeaker and slightly above or below the optimum axis, because the different path length from two drivers producing the same frequency leads to phase cancellation. It is useful to remember that, {{as a rule of}} thumb, 1 kHz has a wavelength of 1 ft in air, and 10 kHz a wavelength of only 1 in. Published results are often only valid for very precise positioning of the microphone to within a centimetre or two.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{way to test}} {{a loudspeaker}} requires an anechoic chamber, with an acoustically transparent floor-grid. The <b>measuring</b> <b>microphone</b> is normally mounted on an unobtrusive boom (to avoid reflections) and positioned 1 metre {{in front of the}} drive units on axis with the high-frequency driver. While this will produce repeatable results, such a 'free-space' measurement is not representative of performance in a room, especially a small room. For valid results at low frequencies, a very large anechoic chamber is needed, with large absorbent wedges on all sides. Most anechoic chambers are not designed for accurate measurement down to 20 Hz.|$|E

In the case of environmental or aircraft noise, distance need not be quoted as it is the level at the point of measurement that is needed, but when measuring refrigerators and similar appliances the distance should be stated; where not stated it is usually one metre (1 m). An extra complication here is the effect of a reverberant room, and so noise measurement on appliances should state [...] "at 1 m in an open field" [...] or [...] "at 1 m in anechoic chamber".

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a statistical framework for automatic recording environment identification (AEI) using acoustic signature of an audio recording. Late reverberant tail is modeled using an exponentially damped uncorrelated noise sequence obeying Gaussian distribution, which is then used for acoustic signature estimation using maximum likelihood estimation framework. Similarity measure based on Euclidian distance is used to classify estimated reverberation parameters for AEI. Density-based clustering method DBSCAN is used for automatic AEI. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using two datasets consisting of (i) hand-clap recordings and (ii) speech recordings. The audio recordings used for performance evaluation were collected in a diverse set of acoustic environments using commercial grade external and built-in microphones. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed framework is efficient for most of the considered acoustic environments. We have also shown that accuracy and reliability of the proposed AEI depends on the microphone type (used to capture audio recording). Sensitivity of the proposed method to various frequency bands has also been evaluated. Performance comparison with Hong’s statistical learning based method [18] indicates that the proposed method achieves relatively higher accuracy.

40|$|National audienceOnly a small {{percentage}} of all acoustical measurements are performed in the well-defined and wellcontrolled environment of a calibration laboratory - on the contrary most acoustical measurements are done under non-controlled conditions which in many cases are not even known in beforehand. This is the reason that some acoustical standards such as the IEC 61672 series (the "Sound Level Meter standard") specify the performance of the <b>measuring</b> <b>microphone</b> over a wide range of environmental conditions. Modern quality measuring condenser microphones often meet or exceed the requirements even under very varying conditions.

The influence of different sound fields on the measurement error is discussed in some detail with practical examples and it is shown how a worst-case error exceeding 10 dB @ 20 kHz is a real risk.

The primary goal of this activity {{is to develop a}} NASA rotorcraft impulsive noise prediction capability which uses first principles fluid dynamics and structural dynamics. During this effort, elastic blade motion and co-processing capabilities have been included in a recent version of the computational fluid dynamics code (CFD). The CFD code is loosely coupled to computational structural dynamics (CSD) code using new interface codes. The CFD/CSD coupled solution is then used to compute impulsive noise on a plane under the rotor using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver. This code system is then applied to a range of cases from the Higher Harmonic Aeroacoustic Rotor Test II (HART-II) experiment. For all cases presented, the full experimental configuration (i. e., rotor and wind tunnel sting mount) are used in the coupled CFD/CSD solutions.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Communication is a {{major issue}} for {{patients}} with tracheostomy who are supported by mechanical ventilation. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may restore speech during expiration; however, the optimal PEEP level for speech may vary individually. We aimed to improve speech quality with an individually adjusted PEEP level delivered under the patient's control to ensure optimal respiratory comfort. METHODS: Optimal PEEP level (PEEPeff), defined as the PEEP level that allows complete expiration through the upper airways, was determined for 12 patients with neuromuscular disease who are supported by mechanical ventilation. Speech and respiratory parameters were studied without PEEP, with PEEPeff, and for an intermediate PEEP level. Flow and airway pressure were <b>measured.</b> <b>Microphone</b> speech recordings were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative assessments of speech, including an intelligibility score, a perceptual score, and an evaluation of prosody determined by two speech therapists blinded to PEEP condition. RESULTS: Text reading time, phonation flow, use of the respiratory cycle for phonation, and speech comfort significantly improved with increasing PEEP, whereas qualitative parameters remained unchanged. This resulted mostly from the increase of the expiratory volume through the upper airways available for speech for all patients combined, with a rise in respiratory rate for nine patients. Respiratory comfort remained stable despite high levels of PEEPeff (median, 10. 0 cm H 2 O; interquartile range, 9. 5 - 12. 0 cm H 2 O). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-controlled PEEP allowed {{for the use of}} high levels of PEEP with good respiratory tolerance and significant improvement in speech (enabling phonation during the entire respiratory cycle in most patients). The device studied could be implemented in home ventilators to improve speech and, therefore, autonomy of patients with tracheostomy.

40|$|Sound {{pressure}} level measurements are key points {{to determine whether}} there is a breach of noise limits. Any measurement made without the knowledge of its uncertainty lacks signifi- cance. For this reason, an open measurement system has been developed at the National Re- search Council Canada for sound {{pressure level}} measurements with the focus on measurement uncertainties. For uncertainty evaluation of such a system, the most difficult task is determining the uncertainty contribution of its acoustic front end, or its microphone and preamplifier assem- bly. The acoustic frond end can be modelled as a linear time-invariant system. Once the fre- quency response of the acoustic front end has been measured, its effect on an arbitrary signal can be analyzed. However, <b>measured</b> <b>microphone</b> frequency response does not include phase in- formation, as no country in the world yet has Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) for microphone pressure sensitivity phase. With the completion of key comparison CCAUV. A- K 5, this situation will change in the near future. Now is the time to determine the uncertainty contribution of acoustic front end using the phase information available, such as that in CCAUV. A-K 5. In this paper, a method for the evaluation of the uncertainty contribution of acoustic front ends is presented. The acoustic front end is first modelled as a linear time- invariant system. Its measured frequency response at discrete frequencies is then curve-fit to ob- tain the response covering the entire frequency domain. The output of the acoustic front end is simply the convolution of the input with the acoustic front end's impulse response. The uncer- tainty contribution is finally calculated by propagating the uncertainties of the acoustic front end output at every time instance. Examples are given for typical acoustic front ends with various types of acoustic signals. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
