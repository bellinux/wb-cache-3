Experts recommend cap end mounts for thrust loads and rod end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. Flange mounts function optimally when the <b>mounting</b> <b>face</b> attaches to a machine support member.|$|E
40|$|Točno određivanje protetske plohe bitno je za estetiku, fonaciju i žvačnu funkciju protetskog nadomjestka. Budući da postoje različiti kriteriji za određivanje te plohe, cilj ovog rada bio je da se odredi njen nagib prema horizontali artikulatora sa obraznim lukom za brzu montažu. Mjerenja su izvršena na modelima 30 eugnatih ispitanika sa najmanje 28 prirodnih zuba, koji su bili montirani u S. A. M. 2 artikulator pomoću obraznog luka za brzu montažu u maksimalnoj interkuspidaciji. Vrijednosti izmjerene pomičnom mjerkom prenesene su na milimetarski papir te su izmjereni kutevi između protetske plohe i horizontale. Dobiveni kut iznosi 9, 42 °+ 4, 1 ° kod naše populacije. Ovaj rezultat može pomoći prilikom određivanja protetske plohe, a također i za kontrolu ispravnosti njenog položaja u artikulatoru. Correct {{determination}} of the occlusal plane is important for estetic, phonetic and masticatory function of the denture. As many different criterias are used in clinical practice to determine the occlusal plane on the wax rims, {{the aim of this}} study was to find the angle between the occlusal plane and the horizontal plane in the articulators with the quick <b>mounting</b> <b>face</b> bow. The measurements were made on the casts of 30 eugnath individuals with at least 28 natural teeth, mounted in S. A. M. artikulator through the transfer with the Quick <b>mounting</b> <b>face</b> bow, in the position of maximum intercuspation. Measurements were made with a precise calliper and were transfered to the callibrated paper. The angles were measured between the occlusal plane and the horizontal plane. The angle is 9, 42 °+ 4, 1 ° in the population of this country. This result can be helpful to determine the occlusal plane or to control if the occlusal plane, determined by the other methods is in the correct position in articulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a new automotive wheel requires extensive testing and possible design changes. The wheel investigated had three major changes during development. These three designs were subjected to a stress analysis, by experimental methods, to allow a comparison to be made between each design. The experimental program tested the wheels under conditions designed to simulate the loading of the front wheels whilst cornering. A loading frame was built for this purpose and all testing was performed statically by multiple loading for different directions of bending moment. Brittle lacquer coatings were used on each wheel to highlight high strain areas and indicate optimum locations for the placement of strain gauges. The strain gauges were then used to evaluate the strains. Wheel stud loads were also monitored via strain gauges applied to two of the wheel studs. All data was stored on magnetic tapes and the stress analysis performed by means of a minicomputer. The results of the stress analysis showed quantitatively the improvement in design from the first to the third wheel design. The analysis of the stud loads and their variation during loading indicated the optimum wheel <b>mounting</b> <b>face</b> geometry to ensure nut loosening would not occur in service...|$|E

40|$|Excessive noise {{generation}} often occurs during the face-milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It {{has been suggested}} that such noise can be reduced by utilizing milling cutters which employ non-uniform insert pitch. This report presents the results of a test series undertaken to determine the noise reduction potential of four different non-uniform insert pitch cutters used to machine the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>face</b> of an aluminum transmission housing. The tests were performed using the actual high volume, transfer-line machinery. It is shown that the use of non-uniform insert pitch does not necessarily reduce overall {{noise generation}}. There is, however, often a reduction in noisiness. To better understand the structural response of the workpiece a complete modal analysis is performed. In addition, noise frequency response functions are generated and are shown to form a basis on which to predict the noise radiation characteristics of the workpiece. A hybrid digital-analog computing system is developed and then used to simulate the workpiece response and to demonstrate the influence of various parameters such as forcing function definition, natural frequency, damping, and width of cut on system response. A more realistic forcing function definition, than the often used force impulse model, is developed. It is subsequently shown that significant differences in workpiece response occur for excitations based on these two models. It is also demonstrated that variation in width of cut has a significant influence on the forcing function definition. Several techniques for improving 2 ̆ 2 quiet cutter 2 ̆ 2 design strategies are illustrated. In particular, a technique of sectoring the workface into sections with constant 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 width of cut is described. Such an approach permits the width of cut variation to be accounted for in a relatively simple manner. It is also shown that noise frequency response functions, when used in conjunction with a realistic model of insert engagement forces, allow prediction of workpiece noise emission characteristics as a function of cutter location.
