5|$|The Perl {{languages}} borrow features {{from other}} programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> text files. Perl 5 gained widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, {{in part due to}} its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that {{controls}} the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E

However, as Trujillo's penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl, the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo.|$|E

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> the guest list.|$|E

5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some {{about the consequences of}} the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> the Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between {{elements of the}} environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} post-depositional <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> burials at two Stone Age {{sites in}} Southern Sweden: the Late Mesolithic Skateholm and Middle Neolithic Ajvide. A distinction is made between non-aggressive and aggressive <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> graves and dead bodies. Fine-grained hori- zontal stratigraphies {{make it possible}} to associate each category with different phases of occupation. It is suggested that aggressive manipulations are generally the result of social stress during periods of hybridisation between different groups and traditions. ...|$|R
5|$|Campaigns in From Dust are {{structured}} as {{a sequence of}} missions, whereby completing certain objectives expedites the tribe's progress and bestows additional powers, such as the capacity to jellify water. Tribal shamans alert the player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, physical <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> the environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to and manipulate further.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> the commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting {{based on their}} own interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} <b>manipulation</b> <b>of</b> company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can {{be motivated by}} a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
