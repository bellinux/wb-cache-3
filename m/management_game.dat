5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city <b>management</b> <b>game</b> SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) {{employee}} Richard Merrill {{invented the}} FOCAL programming language. As an early {{program for the}} language, fellow employee Doug Dyment developed The Sumer Game, programming it for a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. The game is sometimes erroneously attributed to Merrill in 1969, but a 1973 program catalog by the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS) lists Dyment as the original developer. The game was originally described as: [...] "This is a simulation program/game which will run on a minimal PDP-8 system. The economy of a Sumerian city in the year 3000 B. C. is simulated in the fashion of a modern-day 'business game.'" [...] "Business games" [...] were text-based business management simulation games, such as The <b>Management</b> <b>Game,</b> which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University since at least 1958. By 1961, there were over 89 different business and economic simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities. In 1966, IBM employee William McKay developed a business simulation called The Sumerian Game for the Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Northern Westchester County, New York. It is not known whether The Sumer Game {{was inspired by the}} prior Sumerian game, which was a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children, developed in consultation with ancient Middle East history experts.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, during 1957–61, various {{computer}} games continued to be created {{in the context of}} academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze. Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects. [...] Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The <b>Management</b> <b>Game,</b> which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958. By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities. As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, {{there was no such thing}} as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to be a broad survey of both the present and the potential role of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> in education and research. Against a background of the history of business games, we first try to characterize the present development of these <b>games.</b> A few <b>management</b> <b>games</b> are described in some detail, and a number of others are mentioned only briefly. The differences between general and functional business games are discussed. Present uses of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> as a teaching device are surveyed and evaluated. Some hypotheses regarding the relations between the design and administrative characteristics of a business game and its educational properties are also formulated. What might be a major improvement over existing <b>management</b> <b>games,</b> here named the "game case," is then suggested. In the concluding portion of this paper, the potential use of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> as a laboratory for business and social science research is surveyed. Some methodological problems which would arise from research uses of business games are also discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|In most cases, {{the terms}} {{business}} (simulation) game and management (simulation) game {{can be used}} interchangeably {{and there is no}} well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al. determine a business game (or business simulation) as a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation. The descriptions given for a <b>management</b> <b>game,</b> for example, by Forrester and Naylor do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood determines that in a <b>management</b> <b>game</b> profit is not the dominant measure of success.
