Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Diamond {{introduced}} its first <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Diamond DA42 Twin Star. The Twin Star would be popular {{with both a}} civil and government operators; demand from the latter {{led to the development}} of the Aeronautics Defense Dominator, a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for aerial surveillance duties. For several years, the company was engaged in the development of a single-engined very light jet aircraft, known as the Diamond D-Jet, intended for both private and military customers alike. However, as a consequence of the Great Recession, funding became scarce and work on the D-Jet's development was eventually terminated during early 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Stipa-Caproni's great {{drawback}} {{was that}} the intubed propeller design created so much aerodynamic drag {{that most of the}} design's benefits in efficiency were negated by the drag. However, Stipa viewed the Stipa-Caproni as a mere testbed, and probably did not believe that the intubed propeller's aerodynamic drag problem would be significant in the various large, <b>multi-engined</b> flying wing <b>aircraft</b> he had designed.|$|R
500|$|No. 1 Operational Training Unit (No.1OTU) was an {{operational}} conversion {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. [...] Formed in December 1941 at Nhill, Victoria, it relocated to Bairnsdale in mid-1942, and then to East Sale the following year. No.1OTU's primary role was to train aircrew for <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> operations. At its peak of activity in August 1944, it was operating over 130 aircraft, the most numerous being Bristol Beauforts. Its aircraft and personnel also conducted transport missions in New Guinea and maritime patrols in southern Australian waters. Following the end of hostilities, the unit was disbanded in December 1945.|$|E
500|$|No.2 SFTS was {{reported}} as having achieved its nominal strength of 1,100 personnel, including 160 students, in October 1940. By this time up to 2,000 flights per month {{were said to}} be taking place, 150 of them at night, with instructors completing up to 90 hours flying time per week. The school underwent further reorganisation in February 1941 with the establishment of Intermediate Squadron; successful students from this unit were awarded their wings before proceeding to Advanced Squadron. Another new unit, Maintenance Squadron, formed in March. From this point on, No.2 SFTS phased out its Ansons, as single-engined and <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> training was split up on orders of the RAAF Air Board. By the end of July, only Wirraways were in operation, their numbers eventually reaching 96. A Wirraway crashed during an instrument training flight on 29August, killing both pilots. In October, Scherger was posted to take over RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, from Group Captain Charles [...] "Moth" [...] Eaton, who in turn assumed command of No.2 SFTS. Like Scherger, Eaton also served as Forest Hill's station commander.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{where the}} engines {{are off the}} centre line, the rudder {{may be used to}} {{compensate}} for the yaw effect of asymmetric thrust, for example in the event of engine failure. Further, on large jet airliners, the rudder is mainly used to align the aircraft with the runway during crosswind landing and take-off.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the other}} <b>multi-engined</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) {{directly}} attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized interference drag, but had the major operational disadvantage that an uncontained fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, so this was a significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as anti-flutter weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|R

5000|$|Historian James P. Duffy {{believed}} that Germany had no central {{authority over the}} development and construction of advanced weaponry, including advanced military aircraft concepts and designs and an even more critical problem in developing conventional reciprocating aviation engines of power output levels of over 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output apiece that could operate with reliability in combat conditions, needed to power ever more-advanced twin and <b>multi-engined</b> combat <b>aircraft</b> being designed after 1942. Due to this, German scientists were forced to compete for resources that were already scarce due to the war. Hitler was often swayed to spend more time, money and resources on his [...] "miracle weapons" [...] or projects that were exciting and new, but {{less likely to be}} successful. As a result, insufficient attention was also given to the Amerika-Bomber project. The project failed to come to fruition, not because the transatlantic bomber was not feasible, but because the Nazis were unable to manufacture enough parts to produce the aircraft. The Allied bombing was so intense {{near the end of the}} war it disrupted the German supply chain. Also, the German war machine was running very low on supplies, particularly fuel and kept what little was left for defense.|$|R
2500|$|In 1922 Blériot Aéronautique, {{which had}} been a private company became a {{limited-liability}} company, Blériot Aéronautique S.A.. [...] Although a single company, aircraft were produced using both the Blériot and SPAD names, the former generally being used for the larger <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft,</b> while the smaller single-engined aircraft bore the SPAD name, and it was these that were most successful.|$|E
2500|$|The Yak-2 was {{initially}} {{known as the}} Ya-22, in the Yakovlev OKB numbering sequence, before it was redesignated as the Yak-2 in 1941. It was of mixed construction with wooden wings and center fuselage, duralumin forward fuselage, and steel tube framing in the rear fuselage with a wooden upper decking and fabric skin. The cockpit was at the very tip of the nose, but the navigator/gunner was in a compartment behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The prototype was unarmed and no bomb shackles were fitted. It also lacked a radio and navigational equipment. It was, however, the fastest <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the Soviet Union, able to reach [...] at , not least because it lacked heavy military equipment.|$|E
2500|$|With {{very few}} {{exceptions}} aircraft of the pioneer era were relatively small designs {{powered by a}} single engine and designed to carry at most two or three people. [...] Early multiple-engine designs were produced by the Short Brothers, who constructed a number of variants of their Farman-type Improved S.27 design. However the intention of using a pair of engines in these aircraft was to safeguard against engine failure rather than to permit a larger machine, and even a large aircraft such as the Voisin Aero-Yacht, intended to carry six people and with a wingspan of 22.5m (73ft 10in), was powered by a single engine. [...] The first large <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> was [...] Igor Sikorsky's Bolshoi Baltisky, first flown in May 1913 with two engines and later equipped with four.|$|E
50|$|The Junkers company's own 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222, {{liquid cooled}} six-bank inline engine, with four {{cylinders}} in each bank, came {{the closest to}} being the only production, single-crankcase design high-output powerplant candidate during the war years, intended to power not only the Junkers Ju 288, but also many other German <b>multi-engined</b> advanced combat <b>aircraft</b> projects. The 222 was a remarkably compact and efficient engine design, being almost identical in cylinder number, displacement and weight to the British Napier Sabre H-type four-bank sleeve valved inline engine, and the best attempt at creating a German aviation engine that could routinely exceed 1,500 kW output at altitude, but as with the BMW designs and even the later Heinkel HeS 011 advanced turbojet engine, never came close to being a production-ready aircraft powerplant, with just under 300 examples of the Jumo 222 produced in total between several different versions.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to produce an {{advanced}} four engined strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe, a proposal was made by Junkers during 1944 to create a simplified design by combining sub-assemblies of the Ju 188, Ju 288, and Ju 388 (especially its cockpit) to new inner wing panels and midsection fuselage assemblies. This {{would result in a}} sleek aircraft with a length of almost 20.4 m (67 ft) and a wingspan of nearly 31.4 m (103 ft). The Ju 488 was to be initially powered by four BMW 801J radial engines, with each engine nacelle having one standard Ju 88-style rearwards-retracting single strut main landing gear unit, still rotating through 90° to lie flat (with the mainwheel above the end of the strut) within each of the quartet of nacelles. Later versions — as with a growing number of late-war German twin and <b>multi-engined</b> combat <b>aircraft</b> design proposals — were to be powered by four of the very troublesome 24-cylinder Jumo 222 liquid-cooled multibank inline engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 488 V401 and V402 had fuselage sections constructed at the Latécoère factory in France, while the other components were being prepared at Junkers factories in Germany. The Ju 488 V401 and V402 fuselages were completed by 1944, but were damaged by the French Resistance on 16 July 1944. Construction of four more prototypes, the V403 to V406, continued at low priority and were not finished {{by the end of the}} war.|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{founding}} in the 1980s, Austrian manufacturer Diamond Aircraft Industries had concentrated on building up an extensive product line. During the late 1990s, company founder and chief executive office Christian Dries approached the design team with a concept for a twin-engined aircraft, which would become the company's first <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> and serve as the next step above the Diamond DA40. This concept emphasised several key qualities, including {{the need for the}} aircraft to be relatively simple to operate and be fuel-efficient, while also providing a luxurious four-seat passenger compartment akin to modern automobiles. The concept was not popular at the time; Aerospace publication Flying Magazine referred to Diamond's choice to develop a twin-engined aircraft for general aviation use as [...] "the emergence of an all-new light-piston twin in this class something of a surprise." ...|$|E

He awarded bonuses for carrying more passengers and purchasing <b>multi-engined</b> <b>aircraft</b> equipped with radios and navigation aids.

[...] Passenger miles, the numbers of passengers, and new airline employees had all tripled over 1929. Airmail itself, despite its image to many Americans as a frivolous luxury for the few remaining affluent, had doubled following restructuring.
