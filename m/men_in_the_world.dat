5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

25|$|An {{advisor to}} two kings of France, {{he became the}} most {{powerful}} banker {{in the country and}} following the Napoleonic Wars, {{played a major role in}} financing the construction of railroads and the mining business that helped make France an industrial power.

A strong-willed and shrewd businessman, de Rothschild amassed a fortune that made him one of the richest <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Although his papers have never been disclosed, evidence suggests that in today's money, de Rothschild's personal fortune (not including the wealth of his other family members) must have been at least five times the fortune accumulated by Bill Gates.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, William Nelson Page, a civil {{engineer}} and coal mining manager, joined forces with a silent partner, industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers (a principal of Standard Oil {{and one of the}} wealthiest <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world),</b> to develop the Deepwater Railway, a modest 85-mile long short line railroad to access untapped bituminous coal reserves {{in some of the most}} rugged sections of southern West Virginia. When Page was blocked by collusion of the bigger railroads, who refused to grant reasonable rates to interchange the coal traffic, he did not quit. As he continued building the original project, to provide their own link, using Rogers' resources and attorneys they quietly incorporated another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway. In this name, they secured the right-of-way needed all the way across Virginia to reach Hampton Roads, where a new coal pier was erected at Sewell's Point.|$|E

25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, {{but on the whole}} hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands of}} pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E
