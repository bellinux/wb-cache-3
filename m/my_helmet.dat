2500|$|The fifth race of {{the season}} was at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona. The return to Europe allowed most of the teams to update their cars, {{including}} modifications to Button's car, the Brawn BGP 001, which {{had not yet been}} altered since the season began. Button took pole position with the final lap of the qualifying session, describing the updates as [...] "good step forward". Both Button and Barrichello initially planned to stop three times during the race; however, after he fell behind Barrichello at the first corner, Button was switched to a two-stop strategy, and this meant he ended up finishing comfortably ahead. An unhappy Barrichello felt immediately after the race that the team might have sacrificed him to help Button, saying: [...] "If I get the slightest sniff that they are favouring Jenson I'll hang up <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> tomorrow".|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{believe in}} Firedrakes!" [...] cried Alphonso. [...] "I {{wonder what you}} do believe in! Just let me get at the creature!" [...] for he was as brave as a lion. [...] "Hi! Page, <b>my</b> chain-armour, <b>helmet,</b> lance, and buckler! A Molinda! A Molinda!" [...] which was his war-cry.|$|R
60|$|I did not speak. I did {{not even}} smile. I {{wanted to see if}} Ghak, my {{principal}} lieutenant, would recognize me. For some time he stood there looking me over carefully. His eyes took in <b>my</b> large pith <b>helmet,</b> <b>my</b> khaki jacket, and bandoleers of cartridges, the two revolvers swinging at my hips, the large rifle resting against my body. Still I stood with my hands above my head. He examined my puttees and my strong tan shoes--a little the worse for wear now. Then he glanced up once more to my face. As his gaze rested there quite steadily for some moments I saw recognition tinged with awe creep across his countenance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] said I, {{taking off}} <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> and {{removing}} the chain cape which had covered almost {{the whole of}} my face--"I AM NOT THY HUSBAND--I am the slayer of elephants, the world-renowned GAHAGAN!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{cut down}} by a blow that clove <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> your majesty, and stunned me for some time; but, beyond making a {{somewhat}} long gash on my skull, it did me no great harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was [...] "Din! Din! Din! [...] You 'eathen, {{where the}} {{mischief}} 'ave you been? [...] You put some juldee 3 in it [...] Or I'll marrow 4 you this minute [...] If you don't fill up <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> Gunga Din!" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{hardly know}} myself how it happened. The miracle {{of it all}} is that one comes through as I did without a scratch. Bullets rattled on <b>my</b> steel <b>helmet</b> - there were several {{significant}} dents and one hole - {{part of a book}} was shot away in my pocket; a photograph case and cigarette case probably saved my life from one bullet which must have passed under my armpit. I found a wounded Boche in a pillbox and offered to take him to a dressing station. In gratitude the German gave me a drink of brandy. This lad was one of the best.|$|R
6000|$|As we {{drew near}} the crest the major warned {{me not to}} expose myself. [...] "It isn't because there is much chance of our being shot," [...] he explained, [...] "but a matter of drawing the German fire upon others." [...] And yet I {{found it hard to}} believe--despite the {{evidence}} at my feet--that war existed here. The brightness of the day, the emptiness of the place, the silence--save for the humming of the gale--denied it. And then, when we had cautiously rounded a hummock at the top, <b>my</b> steel <b>helmet</b> was blown off--not by a shrapnel, but by the wind! I had neglected to tighten the chin-strap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold, hold," [...] said Richard, [...] "I {{will have}} no more of his dog of a prophet! It makes me sick to think the valiant and worthy Soldan should believe in a dead dog. Yes, I will see his physician. I will put myself into the charge of this Hakim--I will repay the noble Soldan his generosity--I will meet Saladin in the field, as he so worthily proposes, and he shall have no cause to term Richard of England ungrateful. I will strike him to the earth with my battle-axe--I will convert him to Holy Church with such blows as he has rarely endured. He shall recant his errors before my good cross-handled sword, and I will have him baptized on the battle-field, from <b>my</b> own <b>helmet,</b> though the {{cleansing}} waters were mixed {{with the blood of}} us both.--Haste, De Vaux, why dost thou delay a conclusion so pleasing? Fetch the Hakim hither." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Molly," [...] {{returned}} the man, {{as he pushed}} his wife playfully away from him. [...] "Hands off! You know the punishment for assaulting the police is heavy! Now then, Monty," [...] (to the boy), [...] "give up <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> and truncheon. I must be off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Base calumniators!" [...] {{replied the}} knight; [...] "I would I had the chastising of them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, {{it is true}} that all have their enemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak to through the bars of <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> than barefaced." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the fever}} that had possessed me {{this was a}} thing that had not entered into my calculations, nor should it now. I laughed, and from the hollow of <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> not a doubt but the sound must have seemed charged with mockery. I pointed to the cap and doublet I had shed.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton had {{an altered}} helmet design with the {{addition}} of a roulette wheel image on the top. Hamilton had said, [...] "I'll also be wearing a specially-painted helmet for the occasion. When you see it, you'll know why I'll be hoping for it to swing the odds in <b>my</b> favour."Hamilton's <b>helmet</b> underwent one major change during his F1 career. From his debut in 2007 until 2010 his helmet was yellow with a metallic green ribbon on the upper visor and a metallic blue ribbon on the lower visor (these being visually near identical to the helmet of Ayrton Senna, apart from the fact that their designs did not loop all around the back of the helmet, but were cut off either side of the helmet.) It furthermore featured a bright red diagonal patch where these stripes bordered the visor. The yellow however was not a rich, sunburst yellow like Senna's helmet but was a whiter, pastel yellow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' said Merton. 'This affair is {{very well}} organised. Your house is {{probably}} being observed. Now what I propose is this. I can go nowhere dressed as I am. You will, if you please, first send a constable, in uniform, to your house with orders to wait till you return. Next, I shall dress, by your permission, in any spare uniform you may have here and in that costume I shall leave this office and accompany you to your house in a closed cab. You will enter it, bring out a hat and cloak, come into the cab, and I shall put them on, leaving <b>my</b> policeman's <b>helmet</b> in the cab, which will wait. Then, minutes later, the constable will come out, take the cab, and drive to any police office you please. Once within your house, I shall exchange my uniform for any old evening suit {{you may be able}} to lend me, and, when your guests have departed, you and I will drive together to Professor Lumley's, where he will identify me. After that, my course is perfectly clear, and I need give you no further trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Egbert said, turning {{round and}} sitting up, [...] "I must {{not in my}} grief forget my mission, and in truth I am faint with loss of blood. It was well the Danes stopped when they did, for I felt my {{strength}} failing me, and could have held out but little further. Yes, Edmund," [...] he continued, as the lad, tearing strips from his garments, proceeded to bandage his wounds, [...] "your father is dead. Nobly, indeed, did he fight; nobly did he die, with a circle of dead Danes around him. He, Algar, Toley, and myself were the last four to resist. Back to back we stood, and many were the Danes who fell before our blows. Toley fell first and then Algar. The Danes closed closer around us. Still we fought on, till your father was beaten to his knee, and then he cried to me, 'Fly, Egbert, to my son.' Then I flung myself upon the Danes like a wild boar upon the dogs, and with the suddenness of my rush and the heavy blows of my battle-axe cut a way for myself through them. It was well-nigh a miracle, and I could scarce believe it when I was free. I flung away <b>my</b> shield and <b>helmet</b> as soon as I had well begun to run, for I felt the blood gushing out from a dozen wounds, and knew that I should want all my strength. I soon caught sight of you running ahead of me. Had I found we were gaining upon you I should have turned off and made another way to lead the Danes aside, but I soon saw that you were holding your own, and so followed straight on. My knees trembled, and I felt my strength was well-nigh gone, when, looking round, I found the Danes had desisted from their pursuit. I grieve, Edmund, that I should have left the battle alive when all the others have died bravely, for, save a few fleet-footed youths, I believe that not a single Saxon has escaped the fight; but your father had laid his commands upon me, and I was forced to obey, though God knows I would rather have died with the heroes on that field." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} healed {{of them for}} the last month, father. I was brought down by the blow of a mace, which would have {{finished}} me {{had it not been}} for the good work put into <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> by the Milanese armourer. Also I had a wound on the neck, but fortunately it was not very deep." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{himself was}} obliged, much against his will, {{to die in}} peace. [...] "I am ashamed," [...] he said, [...] "after so many battles, to die like a cow; case me in my armor, gird on my sword, put on <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> give me my shield and battle-axe, lift me to my feet, that I may die like a man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Head will be {{all right}} in a day or two, but I stove in <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> and ground a hole in both knees of my new shorts. Had to borrow a fit-out of Bemis, and leave my rags behind. We needn't mention any more than is {{necessary}} to the girls; I hate to be fussed over," [...] answered Sid, trying to speak carelessly.|$|E
40|$|How did I {{get into}} the field of risk regulation? Well, one could {{describe}} it as an {{occupational health and safety}} accident. When I started my PhD at the European University Institute mid 1990 s, risk regulation was hardly on the horizon. Journals like EJRR and Regulation & Governance did not exist, and my initial PhD proposal was inspired by constitutional, international and EU law, focusing on transborder regional cooperation. However, after a year reading around, and clearing my head driving a scooter in the Florentine hills (without a <b>helmet),</b> <b>my</b> thesis topic had changed from territorially defined to functionally defined actors, and was increasingly inspired by political science, and the growing literature on governance in particular. Still, I was in search of a policy area. Being inclined towards market-correcting policies, my initial preference was for either environmental or social policy. At EU level both are decisively regulatory in nature, but social policy also includes tools and actors resulting from a legacy in redistributive policies. So, it was after a long process of changing focus, background literature, and selection of policy area that I finally ended up with… occupational health and safety regulation (OH&S). As a subsector of social policy, OH&S seems to have it all. At EU level, it operates through all typical regulatory instruments such as comitology and agencies, but it equally has unique elements related to its embeddedness in industrial relations, both in terms of regulatory tools and enforcement mechanisms. In fact (with the exception, maybe, of regulating infectious diseases) OH&S is the area in which risk regulation first really took off. Avoiding accidents and dangerous machinery and substances in the workplace was the start for both the welfare and regulatory state. Yet, despite that legacy, OH&S does not have an extensive research community like other risk regulation areas, such as environmental or food safety regulation. This relative insulation of OH&S meant my research was not particularly led by the key research questions and literatures with which one would inevitably engage when studying risk regulation areas that have a broader research community. Rather, I studied OH&S with a perspective framed more by EU law and governance studies. At the same time, EU lawyers discouraged me from engaging in the study of OH&S as they believed my topic could be analysed independently from any particular policy area and assumingly therefore reach a wider audience. But I {{had fallen in love with}} the nerd...|$|R
6000|$|... "In no way, Nessus, {{thanks to}} you; but my head swims and my arm is well nigh broken with that blow. Who {{would have thought}} a beast like that could have struck so hard?

6000|$|... "Not badly. I {{have several}} arrow points {{sticking}} in me, {{in one place}} or another; {{but they have not}} gone deep. My armor kept them out. It was a blow on the head that felled me. There were many Mexicans on the causeway, fighting with the Spaniards; and I was, of course, mistaken for one of them. <b>My</b> <b>helmet</b> broke the blow, and I was stunned rather than injured, I think.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw young Sanders's face, over a naked black shoulder, and a spear driven clean {{through his}} neck, {{and out of}} his mouth and neck what looked like spirts of pink smoke in the water.

And in another second <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> came a whack, fit to split, against the niggers' canoe. It was niggers! Two canoes full.|$|E

"Not seriously, madam; but I feel {{somewhat}} faint from loss of blood, {{and will}} remove <b>my</b> <b>helmet.</b> As it turned out," [...] {{he went on}} somewhat faintly, [...] "it was unfortunate that I did not put on my body armour; but I had not anticipated hard fighting, and preferred to ride without it.

"Then {{the left}} wing of the {{monoplane}} came up like a door that slams, some wires whistled past my head, and one whipped off <b>my</b> <b>helmet,</b> and then, with the seat slipping away from me, down we went.

6000|$|I don't {{know how}} far we rode; but the {{drumming}} of the horse-hoofs and {{the roar of the}} wind and the race of the faint blood-red moon through the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years, and I was literally drenched with sweat from <b>my</b> <b>helmet</b> to my gaiters when the gray stumbled, recovered himself, and pulled up dead lame.
