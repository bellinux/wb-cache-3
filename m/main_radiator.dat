40|$|As {{satellite}} {{design has}} increased in complexity, the evolution of thermal engineering of spacecraft has plateaued. For years, thermal engineers have used the same principles of designing to stacked worst case scenarios and applying additional margin {{on top of the}} already conservative predictions. Recent publications have proposed the use of Bayesian-based propabilistic tools in the design of spacecraft in the effort to avoid overly conservative thermal designs. An issue with utilizing these tools is the typically high computational cost associated with traditional thermal modeling. To help bridge the gap from state-of-the-art to industry standard, this thesis develops a methodology to reduce simulation time and implement these analysis techniques in the industry standard software, Cullimore & Ring Technologies Inc., Thermal Desktop. These design methods are applied to the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS), a student built x-ray spectrometer aboard NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission. Uncertainty analysis shows the area of the <b>main</b> instrument's <b>radiator</b> could have been reduced by 11 %, as compared to the design obtained from conventional techniques, and still have a 99 % probability of meeting the thermal requirements in all mission phases. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis results provide insight into the thermal design of the instrument which could have been used to avoid anomalies experienced during integration and testing. Overall, results show that previously established analysis techniques scale to more complex thermal systems and the insights gained from these methodologies can significantly reduce thermal overdesign. by Conor B.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were (i) {{to investigate the}} main sources and paths of noise on modern utility size wind turbines; (ii) to explore methods of reducing the noise; (iii) to assess our current ability to accurately predict and measure wind turbine noise. The accomplishment of these objectives would enable quieter wind turbines to be developed {{and allow them to}} be located near residential dwellings with greater confidence that the noise would not be a nuisance. A comprehensive review of the current literature was carried out and the findings were used as a basis for the investigative work conducted. It was found that wind turbine noise could be classed as either aerodynamically produced noise or mechanically produced noise. Aerodynamically produced noise on wind turbines arises mainly from the interaction of the flow over the blade with the surrounding air. Mechanically produced noise arises from a number of sources such as the gearbox, generator and hydraulic pumps. The noise can be radiated directly from the noisy component (airborne) and / or transferred through the structure of the turbine and radiated elsewhere (structure-borne) such as the tower. The prototype Windflow 500 wind turbine near to Christchurch was used {{for the majority of the}} investigative work carried out, and to assess the predictions made. The <b>main</b> <b>radiators</b> of noise from the turbine were identified as the blades (86 – 90 % of the total sound power), the tower (initially 8 – 12 % but later reduced to ~ 4 % of the total sound power), and the nacelle cladding (1 % of the total sound power). A prominent tone in the sound power spectrum from the turbine was observed in the 315 Hz 1 / 3 octave band. This was shown to be predominantly caused by gear meshing in the second stage of the gearbox at 311 Hz. The presence of the tone was significant because under commonly used standards a tonal penalty would be applied to the measured sound pressure level from the turbine to account for the extra annoyance caused by the tone. This in turn would mean that any potential wind farms would need to be sited further from residential dwellings than would otherwise be necessary in order to comply with noise regulations. Investigations were carried out that addressed the noise radiated from each of the main contributors outlined above. The sound power level radiated from the tower was found to be effectively reduced by attaching rubber tiles at strategic locations inside the tower. Noise radiated from the nacelle was reduced with a combination of acoustic insulation and acoustic absorption inside the nacelle. An investigation into the gearbox noise was also carried out. Attempts to reduce the tonal noise caused by gear meshing were made with little success but the investigation provided a good basis upon which to conduct further work. Preliminary investigations into both structure-borne and aerodynamically generated blade noise were carried out. The structure-borne blade noise investigation showed that the blades readily vibrated at a range of frequencies, the result being that structurally transmitted noise radiated from the blades was likely to be present at high levels. Research showed that the structure-borne noise radiated from the blades could be significantly reduced by partially filling the internal cavity of the blades with foam. The investigation of aerodynamically produced noise was carried out on a section of Windflow 500 blade in the low noise wind tunnel at the University of Canterbury. The tests showed that the blade generated noise at a range of frequencies including those in the 315 Hz 1 / 3 octave band. This suggested that the tonal noise measured from the blades was not only due to structurally transmitted noise from the gearbox but was also contributed to by aerodynamically produced noise. It was found that the noise from the blade section could be reduced by up to 4. 5 dB at certain frequencies by attaching serrated strips to the trailing edge of the aerofoil. Empirical equations for prediction of wind turbine sound power levels were evaluated and found to be in good agreement with measured data. It was found that accurate spectral predictions of the sound power level were much more difficult. However given spectral data for a turbine, it was found that accurate predictions of the noise propagation from the turbine could be made, taking into account meteorological effects and the effect of complex topography. It was found that the CONCAWE propagation model was well suited to the prediction of noise propagation from wind turbines because of its superior handling of meteorological effects. In an investigation carried out which modelled the Gebbies Pass site of the Windflow 500 it was found that the CONCAWE model could predict sound pressure levels from the turbine to within 2 dB at distances of up to 1400 m. Further work in the area of wind turbine noise should be focused on the reduction of blade noise. This is especially relevant to the Windflow 500 since blade noise was found to be by far the largest contributor to total noise radiated from the turbine. Acoustic treatments elsewhere would therefore produce only small reductions in the total sound power emitted by the turbine...|$|R
40|$|A novel octaband LTE {{mobile phone}} antenna is presented, {{which has a}} compact size with the overall {{dimension}} of 35 [*]mm × 9 [*]mm × 3 [*]mm. The miniaturized octaband antenna is implemented by a simple prototype of three parts which include a folded monopole as feeding element, <b>main</b> <b>radiator</b> element, and parasitic radiator element. The main and parasitic radiator elements are excited by the folded monopole feeding element coupling and shorting to the handset ground plane. A wide bandwidth in low-frequency bands covering from 747 [*]MHz to 960 [*]MHz (LTE Band 13 /GSM 850 /GSM 900) is contributed by both main and parasitic radiator elements. In addition, the folded monopole is designed to resonate at 2530 [*]MHz, and the coupling between the feeding element and <b>main</b> <b>radiator</b> element is designed to resonate at 1840 [*]MHz. Subsequently, the wide bandwidth in high-frequency bands covering from 1710 [*]MHz to 2690 [*]MHz (DCS 1800 /PCS 1900 /WCDMA 2100 /LTE 2300 /LTE 2500) is contributed by both structures. The antenna has the total efficiency up to 30 % in low bands and up to 75 % in high bands, respectively. At the same time, the proposed miniaturized octaband LTE mobile phone antenna is fabricated and tested to verify the design...|$|E
