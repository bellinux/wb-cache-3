40|$|Inhaled bronchodilators, {{including}} long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA) and long-acting β 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists (LABA), are {{the mainstay}} of pharmacological treatment of stable {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Among approved LAMA, tiotropium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, and umeclidinium bromide are administered once daily, whereas aclidinium bromide is administered every 12 h. New LAMA are under development for COPD. Among the approved LABA, indacaterol has a 24 h duration of action, whereas salmeterol and formoterol require twice-daily administration. New once-daily LABA, including vilanterol, olodaterol, <b>milveterol,</b> carmoterol, and abediterol, are in development. LAMA/LABA fixed dose combinations (FDCs) provide the convenience of two bronchodilators with different mechanism of action in a single inhaler. Indacaterol/glycopyrronium, umeclidinium/vilanterol, and olodaterol/tiotropium FDCs have been approved or are under approval and are likely to become a standard pharmacological strategy for COPD. Inhaled dual-pharmacology compounds, combining muscarinic antagonism and β 2 -agonism (MABA) in a single molecule, potentially provide additive or synergistic bronchodilation over either inhaled antimuscarinic or β 2 -agonist monotherap...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because of {{the central}} role of {{bronchodilators}} in the treatment of asthma, in recent years there has been a renewed interest in the field and now once-daily bronchodilators are in development in an attempt to simplify their use. RECENT FINDINGS: A variety of beta 2 -agonists with long half-lives, also called ultra long-acting beta 2 -agonists (ultra-LABAs; indacaterol, carmoterol, <b>milveterol,</b> GSK- 642444, BI- 1744 -CL, LAS- 100977, and PF- 00610355) are currently under development with the hopes of achieving once-daily dosing. Between them, indacaterol, GSK- 642444, and carmoterol are at a more advanced stage of development. Also several novel inhaled long-acting antimuscarinic agents are currently being developed, but their role in the treatment of asthma is limited. As combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a LABA is considered the first-line approach for treating patients suffering from asthma, some novel once-daily combinations of LABAs and ICSs are under development. SUMMARY: Bronchodilators are central in the symptomatic management of asthma. It is likely that the once-daily dosing of a bronchodilator would be a significant convenience and probably a compliance-enhancing advantage, leading to improved overall clinical outcomes in patients with asthma. In any case, as a LABA in combination with an ICS continues to be the most effective asthma treatment, once-daily combinations of ultra-LABAs and ICSs will be central in the treatment of asthmatic patients in the next year...|$|E
40|$|Inhaled bronchodilators, {{including}} beta 2 -agonists and antimuscaric receptor antagonists, are {{the mainstay}} of pharmacotherapy in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The short-acting beta(2) -agonists, including salbutamol, and fenoterol, have a rapid onset of action, a bronchodilating effect for 3 - 6 h and are used on demand. The long-acting beta(2) -agonists (LABAs), including salmeterol and formoterol, have 12 -hour duration of action and are used with a twice-daily dosing regimen for long-term COPD treatment. Unlike salmeterol, formoterol has a rapid onset of action. Pharmacological characteristics required by novel inhaled LABAs include 24 h bronchodilator effect in vivo which would make them suitable for once daily administration (ultra-LABA), high potency and selectivity for beta 2 -adrenoceptors, rapid onset of action, low oral bioavailability (< 5 %) after inhalation, and high systemic clearance. Indacaterol, which has been approved for long-term treatment of COPD in Europe and in the USA, has a 24 -h duration of action and a once-daily dosing regimen. Newer ultra-LABAs, including olodaterol, vilanterol, <b>milveterol,</b> carmoterol, and abediterol, are in development. Combination with ICS (fluticasone/salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol) appears to provide an additional benefit over the monocomponent therapy, although the extent of this benefit is variable and often not clinically significant in all the endpoints assessed. In patients with COPD, treatment with ICS is associated with increased risk of pneumonia which should be carefully considered when assessing the risk/benefit ratio of ICS/LABA combinations. Subphenotyping of patients with COPD (e. g., frequent exacerbations, sputum eosinophilia, mixed asthma/COPD phenotype) might help identify those patients {{who are most likely to}} benefit from addition of ICS to bronchodilating treatment. Ultra-LABA/LAMA combination treatment is under development and is likely to become a standard pharmacological strategy for COPD. Dual-pharmacology inhaled muscarinic antagonist-beta 2 agonist (MABA) molecules provide a new approach to the treatment of COPD...|$|E
