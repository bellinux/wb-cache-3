40|$|The {{instability}} of <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences</b> dispersed in the genome {{has been linked}} to a deficiency in cellular mismatch repair. This phenotype has been frequently observed in various human neoplasms and is regarded as a major factor in tumorigenesis. To demonstrate alterations in <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences,</b> polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoretic analysis are techniques often used. However, the electrophoretic profiles of PCR-amplified <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences</b> have not been well characterized. Moreover, the conventional method using autoradiography has critical problems in detection characteristics and migration accuracy. We made use of fluorescence-labeled PCR and laser scanning with linear detection characteristics, so as to detect bands quantitatively. Next, we characterized Taq polymerase-dependent modification of the amplified <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences,</b> using artificially synthesized microsatellite alleles and we optimized the electrophoretic profiles by enzymatic modification with T 4 DNA polymerase. We developed a dual fluorescence co-electrophoresis system, in which both samples derived from cancer and normal tissues are electrophoresed in the same lane, in order to minimize migration errors. These improvements remarkably facilitate precise and objective assessments of microsatellite instability. Analyzing many positive cases in cell lines and tissue specimens, we classified all the patterns of microsatellite alteration and set up new criteria for assessing microsatellite instability...|$|R

Several conserved motifs involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial genome replication process, including one conserved sequence block (CSB 1), and three termination-associated sequences were identified. The most remarkable feature found in this control region was the presence of six microsatellite-containing tandem repeats between the CSB 1 motif and the tRNAPhe gene.

30|$|The absence or {{deficiency}} of DNA MMR activity can developed instability in simple sequence repeats, that known as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI {{can be detected}} by isolation of the DNA from a tumor specimen that has defective DNA MMR activity. The <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequence</b> was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and compared with normal DNA of that individual. The DNA of the cancerous cell contains deletions or addition in the <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequence,</b> which {{can serve as a}} surrogate for the absence of DNA MMR activity. Some microsatellite sequences occur in coding regions and mutations in target genes actually mediate neoplastic behavior, This phenotype was first found in Lynch syndrome tumors (Boland et al. 1998). Germline mutations in one of the four major HNPCC-associated MMR genes; i.e., MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH 6, and PMS 2, are detected in up to 70 – 80  % of such families (Peltomaki 2003). MMR deficiency is a common feature of many types of tumors i.e.. Loss of expression from one of the MMR proteins (MSH 2, MSH 6, MSH 3, MLH 1, and PMS 2) which is associated with an increased predisposition to colorectal, gastric, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers (Guillotin and Martin 2014; McConechy et al. 2015; Shilpa et al. 2014; van Grieken et al. 2013). MSI is also observed in a subset of tumors induced with viral infections. EBV DNase caused chromosomal aberrations and increased the MSI and frequency of genetic mutations in human epithelial cells (Wu et al. 2010). The hepatitis C virus core protein promoted microsatellite instability in PH 5 CH 8 cells. MSI was a real event occurring in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts and in chickens with lymphoma infected with MDV (Yao et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2012).|$|E

Clusters of 18 S rDNA were found in one microchromosome pair in each of the three species, coinciding to a region of (CGG) 10 sequence accumulation. Interstitial telomeric sequences were found in some macrochromosomes pairs, indicating possible regions of fusions, which can be related to variation of diploid number in the family. Only one, from the 11 different <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences</b> used, did not produce any signals. Both species of genus Colaptes showed a similar distribution of <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequences,</b> with some difference when compared to M. candidus. Microsatellites were found preferentially in the centromeric and telomeric regions of micro and macrochromosomes. However, some sequences produced patterns of interstitial bands in the Z chromosome, which corresponds to the largest element of the karyotype in all three species. This was not observed in the W chromosome of Colaptes melanochloros, which is heterochromatic in most of its length, but was not hybridized by any of the sequences used.

40|$|Abstract: Microsatellites (SSR – simple {{sequence}} repeats, STR – short tandem repeats, SSLP – simple {{sequence length}} polymorphism, VNTR – variable number of tandem repeats) are {{the class of}} repetitive DNA sequences present in all living organisms. Particular characterstics of microsatellites, such as {{their presence in the}} genomes of all living organisms, high level of allelic variation, co-dominant mode of inheritance and potential for automated analysis make them an excellent tool for a number of approaches like genotyping, mapping and positional clonig of genes. The three most popular types of markers containing microsatellite sequences that are presently used are: (1) SSR (simple sequence repeats), generated by amplifying in a PCR reaction with the use of primers complementary to flanking regions; (2) ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats), based on the amplification of regions between inversely oriented closely spaced microsatellites; and (3) SAMPL (selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci), which utilises AFLP (amplified fragment-length polymorphism) methodology, with one exception – for the second amplification, one of the starters is complementary to the <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequence.</b> The usefulness of the three above-mentioned markers for numerous purposes has been well documented for plants...|$|E

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, repair of mismatches results in gene conversion or restoration, whereas failure to repair mismatches results in postmeiotic segregation (PMS). By examining the conversion and PMS in yeast strains deficient in various MMR genes and heterozygous for large inserts (107 bp) with either a mixed sequence or a 39 (CA/TG) repetitive <b>microsatellite</b> <b>sequence,</b> we demonstrate that: (1) the inhibition of conversion by large inserts depends upon a complex containing both Msh 2 and Pms 1 proteins; (2) conversion is not inhibited if the single-stranded DNA loop in the heteroduplex is the microsatellite sequence; and (3) large heteroduplex loops with random sequence or repetitive sequence might be repaired by two complexes, containing either Msh 2 or Pms 1. Our results suggest that inhibition of recombination by heterologous inserts and large loop repair are not processed by the same MMR complexes.
