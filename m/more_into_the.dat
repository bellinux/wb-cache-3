5|$|In 729, after a mixed {{performance}} {{against the}} Khazars, Maslamah was replaced yet again {{as governor of}} Armenia and Adharbayjan by al-Jarrah. For all his energy, Maslamah's campaigning failed to produce the desired results: {{by the time of}} his dismissal, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.|$|E

The routes quickly exit {{the village and}} separate shortly thereafter south of the hamlet of De Kalb, with the Oswegatchie leaving the path of US11 and following NY812. NY812 heads north, serving De Kalb and crossing over the Oswegatchie south of an intersection with CR14, a connector leading to Rensselaer Falls that was once NY186. Here, NY812 begins to the northwest as it approaches the village of Heuvelton.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, when Homer {{collects}} {{supplies to}} protect his family and home from the marauding zombies, he decides to pursue a black sports car—which is a probe for the aliens' ship—to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. There, he finds Professor Frink, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: nuclear waste. He {{plans to use the}} alien ship's tractor beam to suck up cars that are loaded with barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three <b>more,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of Foolish Earthlings.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> teen pop and R genres, as she felt that restyling herself to match {{the image of her}} contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of whom were disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and cracking the top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E

5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out with his left hand for a corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho snatched the ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating more chances – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E

5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering <b>more</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
