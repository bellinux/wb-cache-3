5|$|In 1952, Mary Immaculate Hospital {{opened its}} doors in the only faith-based {{hospital}} on the Peninsula. The Mary Immaculate Hospital is an acute care hospital, and was relocated to the Denbigh area {{of the city and}} offers a wide range of services, including <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgery, orthopedic services, The Liver Institute of Virginia, and women's services.|$|E
5|$|Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most {{commonly}} before {{and around the}} time of menopause. In the United States they are more common in whites, particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive,</b> percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
25|$|This finding creates new {{opportunities}} for <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> detection of CJD.|$|E
25|$|BPH can {{be treated}} with medication, a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{procedure}} or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent, to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> hip {{resurfacing}} {{procedure is}} a further refinement to hip resurfacing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{procedures}} {{have been developed}} in total knee replacement (TKR) that do not cut the quadriceps tendon. There are different definitions of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> knee surgery, which may include a shorter incision length, retraction of the patella (kneecap) without eversion (rotating out), and specialized instruments. There are few randomized trials, but studies have found less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and shorter recovery. However, no studies have shown long-term benefits.|$|E
25|$|Mitral {{valvuloplasty}} is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> therapeutic {{procedure to}} correct an uncomplicated mitral stenosis by dilating the valve using a balloon.|$|E
25|$|Indocyanine green {{fluoroscopy}} is a safe, <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{and useful}} tool for surgical evaluation. Microsurgeons use indocyanine green lymphography {{to assist in}} LVA surgeries.|$|E
25|$|Many fellowships {{also offer}} {{opportunity}} {{to become familiar with}} anesthetic techniques for pediatric cardiac surgery and <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> cardiac surgery, however no formal case numbers for ACGME accreditation are required.|$|E
25|$|A {{coronary}} catheterization is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{procedure to}} access the coronary circulation and blood filled chambers of the heart using a catheter. It is performed for both diagnostic and interventional (treatment) purposes.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgery {{became more}} prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm {{has been built}} around robotic surgery (also known as robotic-assisted surgery), {{despite a lack of}} data {{suggesting}} it has significant benefits that justify its cost.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of harmful}} {{effects on the}} patient and the {{operator}} make MRI well-suited for interventional radiology, where the images produced by an MRI scanner guide <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedures. Such procedures must be done with no ferromagnetic instruments.|$|E
25|$|Inpatient and {{outpatient}} surgery serves patients requiring trauma, orthopedic, urological, ear/nose/throat, retina, cardiovascular, neurological, plastic and bariatric surgery. The surgical staff is experienced in laparoscopic, <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> and muscle-sparing techniques, {{as well as}} the robotic Da Vinci Surgical System.|$|E
25|$|Embracing {{the trend}} toward more natural {{ingredients}} in cosmetics, Ahava purifies its own water and, according to the company, employs <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> techniques to harvest mud and minerals. Ingredients are not tested on animals and Ahava products are packaged in recyclable containers.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{surgeons}} prefer {{performing the}} bowel resection laparoscopically, mainly because the postoperative pain is reduced and the patient's recovery is faster. The laparoscopic surgery is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedure in which {{three to four}} smaller incisions {{are made in the}} abdomen or navel.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} imaging {{techniques}} such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to diagnose and/or treat diseases. Interventional radiology is the performance of (usually <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive)</b> medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{treatment}} of arterial aneurysms has been limited to either surgical intervention, or watchful waiting in combination with control of blood pressure. In recent years, endovascular or <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> techniques {{have been developed for}} many types of aneurysms. Aneurysm Clips are used for surgical procedure i.e. clipping of aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery ligation, {{sometimes}} also laparoscopic occlusion of uterine arteries are <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{methods to}} limit blood {{supply of the}} uterus by a small surgery that can be performed transvaginally or laparoscopically. The principal mechanism of action may be similar like in UAE but is easier to perform and fewer side effects are expected.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{applications}} {{for this research}} include blood glucose monitoring systems to help manage diabetes mellitus. As the sensors employ an optical response, monitoring could be achieved using <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> methods, one such example is the investigation of a contact lens that contains a boronic acid based sensor molecule to detect glucose levels within ocular fluids.|$|E
25|$|The double {{incision}} {{surgery and}} <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgery seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing {{the size of}} the incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures is significantly impaired. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. Surgeons using these approaches are advised to use intraoperative x-ray fluoroscopy or computer guidance systems.|$|E
25|$|A further {{subdivision}} is {{the diagnostic}} versus therapeutic specialties. While the diagnostic process {{is of great}} importance in all specialties, some specialists perform mainly or only diagnostic examinations, such as pathology, clinical neurophysiology, and radiology. This line is becoming somewhat blurred with interventional radiology, an evolving field that uses image expertise to perform <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedures.|$|E
25|$|Minimaze {{procedures}} are <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{versions of the}} original Cox maze procedure but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). They use laser, cryothermy, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.|$|E
25|$|Hand bookbinders {{create new}} {{bindings}} that {{run the gamut}} from historical book structures made with traditional materials to modern structures made with 21st-century materials, and from basic cloth-case bindings to valuable full-leather fine bindings. Repairs to existing books also encompass a broad range of techniques, from <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> conservation of a historic book to the full restoration and rebinding of a text.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{treatments for}} fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment {{is a potential}} option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic concept}} behind interventional {{radiology}} is to diagnose or treat pathologies, {{with the most}} <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> technique possible. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedures are currently performed more than ever before. These procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake, {{with little or no}} sedation required. Interventional Radiologists and Interventional Radiographers diagnose and treat several disorders, including peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, gastrostomy tube placements, biliary stents and hepatic interventions. Images are used for guidance, and the primary instruments used during the procedure are needles and catheters. The images provide maps that allow the Clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times, as well as hospital stays. To be a trained interventionalist in the United States, an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in IR.|$|E
25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Venipuncture {{is useful}} {{as it is}} a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> way to obtain cells and {{extracellular}} fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium which provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to directing serving as Chairman of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Tewari {{is a member}} of several professional societies including: American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, American Urological Association, NYS Medical Advisory Board, International Society of Quality of Life Research, Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Society of <b>Minimally</b> <b>Invasive</b> Therapy, Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), Indian Association of Urological Surgeons and Michigan Prostate Cancer Consortium.|$|E
25|$|Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic or keyhole surgery) is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{surgical}} procedure on a joint {{in which an}} examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed using an arthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision. Arthroscopic procedures can be performed during ACL reconstruction. While commonly used for meniscal injuries to the knee, this use is not supported by any evidence for its claimed positive results.|$|E
