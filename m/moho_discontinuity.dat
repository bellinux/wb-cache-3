30|$|This {{analysis}} {{demonstrates that}} the lower boundary of anomaly 2 corresponds with {{the boundary between the}} lower and upper crust. GF amplitudes from subsources in the upper crust are about three times larger than those from subsources in the lower crust. There are two possible causes of the lower GF amplitudes from subsources in the lower crust and mantle: the effect of lower seismic potency at greater depths, as previously discussed, and the effect of waves reflected at the <b>Moho</b> and Conrad <b>discontinuities.</b> Reflection of upward incident waves would decrease GF amplitudes, whereas reflection of downward incident waves would increase GF amplitudes. Because it is difficult to isolate the effect of reflection of long-period waves in a complex 3 D velocity structure, we instead evaluated the effects of properties of the source media. That is, we examined the effects of seismic potency and seismic impedance on GF amplitudes and assumed that wave reflections at the <b>Moho</b> and Conrad <b>discontinuities</b> accounted for all that we could not attribute to seismic potency or seismic impedance.|$|R

We also address station corrections for shallow structures using a synthetic receiver function. Crustal discontinuities seem to be complicated at the south side from the northern limit of the NKTZ.

They estimated that the reflectors are two very thin layers with low S wave velocities. The total thickness of these reflectors is about 0.1  km. It is inferred from this fact that the reflector body contains liquid material such as magma or water. Umino et al. (2002) estimated the location of reflectors using the seismograms of aftershocks of the 1998 M 5.0 Sendai earthquake. They showed that a clear reflector is located {{at a depth of}} 15 – 21  km just beneath the fault plane of the earthquake (Nagamachi-Rifu fault), and supposed that it is related to fluids. These reflectors are located at relatively shallow depths; however, S wave reflectors in the northern Kinki district seem to be located at greater depths than those beneath Nikko-Shirane volcano and the Nagamachi-Rifu fault. Doi and Nishigami (2007) estimated the three-dimensional distributions of S wave reflectors in the source region of the 2000 Western Tottori Earthquake. They reported three reflection zones exist beneath the source region, which are located at depth of 15 – 25, 30 – 40 and 50 – 60  km (Doi and Nishigami 2007). They proposed that the first and second reflectors are corresponding to the Conrad and the <b>Moho</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> respectively. Moreover, they discussed the relationship between the reflection strength in the source region and deep low-frequency earthquakes occurred beneath the source region of this earthquake.
