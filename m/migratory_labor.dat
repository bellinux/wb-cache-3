40|$|There {{are many}} {{characteristics}} of contemporary African societies that puzzle demographers and others concerned with {{economic and social}} modernization. One {{of the most prominent}} is that the birth rate remains in both urban and rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa in spite of the presence of several factors that supposedly promote lowering of fertility (McNicoll 1980). Some of these factors are increased survivorship of children into adulthood, increased availability of education and levels of educational attainment (for both sexes), increased urbanization, and increased monetarization of the economy via <b>migratory</b> wage <b>labor</b> and cash cropping. Each of these is normally thought to promote the freeing of young people from the control of elders and to foster the development of economically independent nuclear families, close conjugal relations between spouses, and parenting practices with more intense investment in smaller numbers of higher quality children (Caldwell 1977 a, 1977 b, 1982; Caldwell and Okonjo 1968; Anker et al., eds. 1982; Sudarkasa 1977; Page and Lesthaeghe 1981; see Barkow and Burley [1980] and Vining [1986] for further biosocial consideration of demographic transition. ...|$|R

The infrastructural zone is understood as a temporary <b>migratory</b> route, where <b>labor</b> is accumulated and moved, and Panh and Biemann's films are analyzed as "film-routes", formally constructed to mirror the infrastructural migration route, in an effort to expose the complex dynamics between globalization, labor and land.

Rather, it should pay due attention to the enduring consequences of the fact that, as Cedric Robinson already said in 1983, “there has never been a moment in modern European history (if before) that <b>migratory</b> and/or immigrant <b>labor</b> was not a significant aspect of European economies. That this is not more widely understood seems to be a consequence of conceptualization and analysis: the mistaken use of the nation as a social, historical, and economic category; a resultant and persistent reference to national labor ‘pools’ (e.g., ‘the English working class’); and a subsequent failure of historical investigation” (Robinson, 1983, p. 23).|$|R

Historically the area was a center of the Sukuma group, an amalgam of various in-migrants over time who are brought together by traditions of healing that link to collective rituals as well as to agricultural and pastoralist prowess. The recent explosion of the commercial fishing and gold mining industries in the region has dramatically eroded people’s landscapes, and altered social structures and <b>migratory</b> patterns of <b>labor.</b> The first section of the thesis documents traditions in Sukuma subsistence practices as these link to traditional healing and patriarchy, chronicling transformations wrought by colonial, socialist, post-socialist, and neoliberal political economies within Tanzania over the last century. The second section captures a paradox: factors driving an increasing need for traditional medicine at the same time inhibit its practice, and transform its legacies. The prevalence of HIV has led to new modes of commercialized traditional healing, with storefront remedies and new floral and faunal components. However, new social tensions are eroding the socially embedded rituals that intrinsically link physical healing with political and spiritual leadership. The threats to traditional medicine (e. g. criminalization, climate-driven in migration of non-local healers and their remedies, loss of biodiversity and conservation related restrictions) are greater than ever. Overall, the study thus contributes to scholarship on healers and magico-political leaders in East Africa, but also to emerging work on African environmental justice issues, by addressing Mwanza’s traditional healers as key players in systems of nested and interconnected vulnerability to environmental and economic change...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} economic and cultural (re) definition of labor and laborers. It traces the growing reliance upon contingent work {{as the foundation for}} industrial capitalism along the Pacific Coast; the shaping of urban space according to the demands of workers and capital; the formation of a working class subject through the discourse and social practices of both laborers and intellectuals; and workers’ struggles to improve their circumstances in the face of coercive and onerous conditions. Woven together, these strands reveal the consequences of a regional economy built upon contingent and <b>migratory</b> forms of <b>labor.</b> This workforce was hardly new to the American West, but the Pacific Coast’s reliance upon contingent labor reached its apogee after World War I, drawing hundreds of thousands of young men through far flung circuits of migration that stretched across the Pacific and into Latin America, transforming its largest urban centers and working class demography in the process. The presence of this substantial workforce (itinerant, unattached, and racially heterogeneous) was out step with the expectations of the modern American worker (stable, married, and white), and became the warrant for social investigators, employers, the state, and other workers to sharpen the lines of solidarity and exclusion. Beginning in the 1920 s, and coming to a point under the economic weight of the Great Depression, these various constituents created new urban spaces, expressive cultures, and discourses, along with new regulations and forms of protest that would shape the politics of labor in the coming decades. Highlighting the centrality of contingent labor, this study calls into question predominant liberal narratives about modern industrial capitalism. It challenges our understanding of capitalism’s stability and the opportunities afforded to workers in a so-called free market, and lays plain {{the economic and}} cultural realities of a workforce segmented by class and race...|$|R

The solution to the salt shortage is presented in the climax of the film where the young Soviet power builds a road that connects the isolated region to the outside world.

Yet both U.S and Mexican employers became heavily dependent on braceros for willing workers; bribery was a common way to get a contract during this time.

Moreover, Truman's Commission on <b>Migratory</b> <b>Labor</b> in 1951 disclosed that the presence of Mexican workers depressed the income of American farmers, even as the U.S Department of State urged a new bracero program to counter the popularity of communism in Mexico.

Between 1944 and 1954, [...] "the decade of the wetback," [...] the number of illegal immigrants coming from Mexico increased by 6,000 percent. It is estimated that before Operation Wetback got under way, {{more than a million}} workers had crossed the Rio Grande illegally. Cheap labor displaced native agricultural workers, and increased violation of labor laws and discrimination encouraged criminality, disease, and illiteracy. According to a study conducted in 1950 by the President's Commission on <b>Migratory</b> <b>Labor</b> in Texas, the Rio Grande Valley cotton growers were paying approximately half of the wages paid elsewhere in Texas. The United States Border Patrol aided by municipal, county, state, federal authorities, and the military, began a quasi-military operation of the search and seizure of all illegal immigrants. Fanning out from the lower Rio Grande Valley, Operation Wetback moved Northward. Initially, illegal immigrants were repatriated through Presidio because the Mexican city across the border, Ojinaga, had rail connections to the interior of Mexico by which workers could be quickly moved on to Durango. The forces used by the government were relatively small, perhaps no more than 700 men, but were augmented by border patrol officials who hoped to scare illegal workers into fleeing back to Mexico. Ships became a preferred mode of transport because they carried illegal workers farther from the border than buses, trucks, or trains. It is difficult to estimate the number of illegal immigrants that left due to the operation—most voluntarily. The INS claimed as many as 1,300,000, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. The program was ultimately abandoned due to questions surrounding the ethics of its implementation.
