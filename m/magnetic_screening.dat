Jack was educated at South School, and became the first Southland youth to win a Junior Scholarship to the University of New Zealand in 1890. The next year, he chose to enrol at Canterbury College. He passed his final B.A. exams in 1893. With the start of the new term in April 1894, Ernest Rutherford and J.A. Erskine applied to use a basement room in which to carry out electrical experiments. It was here that Erskine investigated the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> of high-frequency oscillations by various metals, an offshoot of Rutherford's pioneering work. Results of his research appeared in the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute in 1895.|$|E

Metamaterials are introduced, being some of their possible uses and some applications (according to referenced papers) will be exposed. Specifically, a type of metamaterials will be explained: <b>magnetic</b> <b>screens.</b> The tools used for the design and simulation of multi-antenna structures involving these artificial materials will be commented. A multi-antenna system design based onm etamaterial separators will be designed {{in order to reduce the}} size of the multi-antenna structure keeping the isolation level between antenna elements. Firstly, a unit cell to be used in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> will be analysed and designed. Next, a monopole will be tuned at an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Secondly, two multi-antenna systems will be designed, a first having two monopoles and another one with four monopoles. These designs will be compared with the performance of: 1) a conventional system where the decoupling is achieved by the separating the antennas; 2) a system where the decoupling is achieved by the inclusion of a metal screen; and 3) a system that includes an artificial <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> (metamaterial) composed with a periodic arrangement of a pre-designed unit cell. The parameters evaluated for comparison between the three types of decoupling systems are: reflection coefficient, isolation, and radiation pattern, all of them at frequency of 2. 45 GHz because this frequency corresponds to a free band in the National Frequency Table and consequently this system may be used in Wi-Fi systems.

40|$|Using the Schwinger-Keldysh closed {{time path}} {{integral}} formalism {{we show that}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass in QED and QCD at one loop level is non-zero {{as long as the}} single particle distribution function f(k⃗) is non-isotropic, i. e. it depends on the direction of the momentum. For isotropic distribution functions such as those corresponding to thermal equilibrium the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass at one loop level is found to be zero which is consistent with finite temperature field theory. The non-zero <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass in non-isotropic non-equlibrium situations has fundamental importance in that it acts as a natural cut-off to remove infrared divergences in the magnetic sector. Thus it allows one to avoid infrared problems which previously made it difficult to use a transport theory approach using perturbative QCD or QED scattering kernels to study the thermalization of a QED or QCD plasma.

40|$|A superconducting <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> can be {{built as}} a stack of several {{sections}} of milled 2 G coated conductors. Each section consists of a closed loop where persistent currents can flow and provide a strong attenuation of external dc magnetic fields. The {{purpose of the present}} work is to study experimentally several geometries of such <b>magnetic</b> <b>screens</b> made out of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) coated conductors from SuperPower. Our aim is to investigate in details the influence of the aspect ratio and the number of layers of the assembly on the magnetic shielding properties. In order to do so, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> is subjected to an axial quasi-static (“dc”) magnetic field ramped slowly a fixed sweep rates. A Hall probe is used to measure the local magnetic induction inside the assembly {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic induction. Results show that the threshold magnetic induction (above which magnetic shielding ceases) increases with the number of layers and that the shielding factor (defined as to ratio between the applied magnetic induction and the magnetic induction measured inside the screen) is improved for increasing aspect ratios of the global coated conductor assembly. Using a double layer of 18 sections at T = 77 K, dc magnetic fields up to 56 mT can be shielded by a factor larger than 10. The experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions for a perfect (type-I) magnetic shield with the same aspect ratio.

From the long-distance {{behaviour}} of correlation functions of {{temporal and spatial}} components of the gauge fields we extract electric (me) and magnetic (mm) screening masses. For temperatures larger than twice Tc we find no additional temperature dependence in me(T) /T, while mm(T) /T drops with increasing temperature.

An uninterrupted superconducting path {{is achieved by}} splitting two sections of a slit 2 G tape {{in order to obtain}} a loop without joint. Several loops are stacked together to obtain a coil acting as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen.</b> Persistent currents in this coil are shown to shield efficiently magnetic fields that are applied at very low sweep rates (500 @T/s). The shielding properties are characterized by measuring the shielding factor of the screen, i. e. the ratio between the magnetic field with and without screen. In a coil made of a single layer of coated conductors, the shielding factor {{at the center of the}} coil is shown to exceed 10 for an applied DC magnetic flux density of 5 mT. The uniformity of the shielding factor along the axis of the screen is also investigated; results show the magnetic field is attenuated by a factor larger than 3 near the open ends.
