25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the <b>microchannel</b> plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the <b>microchannel</b> plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

The polymers poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene glycol), and poly(vinyl alcohol) were assessed for their quality as stabilization coatings after deposition from flowing and stationary solutions. Additionally, the influence of coating the <b>microchannels</b> homogeneously with a single kind of polymer or heterogeneously with two different polymers was investigated.

Furthermore, heterogeneous coatings led to two-phase flows which had a better-defined and more stable interface over long distances (i. e., 40 -mm-long <b>microchannels).</b> Finally, the partitioning of fuchsin dye in the coated <b>microchannels</b> was demonstrated, establishing the feasibility of the use of the polymer-coated PDMS <b>microchannels</b> for determination of logP values in laminar octanol/water flows...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microchannels</b> {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} for electronic cooling applications ever since they {{were found to be}} effective in removing high heat flux from small areas. The rate of heat removed using <b>microchannels</b> depends on many factors including the geometry shape, solid and fluid materials used, and surface roughness, among others. Many configurations of <b>microchannels</b> {{have been studied}} with various materials and compared for their effectiveness in heat removal. However, there is little research done so far in using Phase Change Material (PCM) fluids and pin fins in <b>microchannels</b> to enhance the heat transfer. PCM fluids exhibit greater heat transfer when the phase change material undergoes liquid-to-solid transformation. Staggered pins in <b>microchannels</b> have also shown higher heat removal characteristics because of the continuous breaking and formation of the thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layer; they also exhibit higher pressure drop because pins act as flow obstructers. This paper presents numerical results of circular, square, straight rectangular <b>microchannels</b> with various aspect ratios (1 : 2, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8), and rectangular <b>microchannels</b> with two characteristic staggered pins (square and circular, fixed height with no variation in aspect ratio). The heat transfer performance of a single phase fluid and PCM fluid in all of these <b>microchannels</b> and the corresponding pressure drop characteristics are also presented. An effective specific heat capacity model was used to account for the phase change process of PCM fluid. Comparison of heat transfer characteristics of single phase fluid and PCM fluid are presented for all the geometries considered. Among the straight <b>microchannels,</b> 1 : 8 geometry was found to have the highest Nusselt number. The use of PCM fluid in straight <b>microchannels</b> increased the Nusselt number by 3 - 7 percent compared to the single phase fluids. Among the staggered pin <b>microchannels,</b> circular pins were found to be more effective in terms of heat transfer by exhibiting higher Nusselt number. Circular pin <b>microchannels</b> were also found to have lower pressure drop compared to the square pin <b>microchannels.</b> Overall, for all the geometries considered, {{it was found that the}} PCM fluid enhances the heat transfer compared to the SPF fluid...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{since the}} {{limiting}} resolution is usually {{defined as the}} point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an image intensifier tube's operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or glass, at the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the <b>microchannel</b> plate itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{some type}} of {{electron}} multiplier is used, though other detectors including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. <b>Microchannel</b> plate detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists {{of a pair of}} metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.|$|E
25|$|An image {{intensifier}} or {{image intensifier}} tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image intensifier), or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a <b>microchannel</b> plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Heat exchangers equipped with <b>microchannels</b> have many industrial applications. This is due to their capability for transfer of high heat fluxes. In flow boiling in <b>microchannels</b> three different flow regimes: steady bubbly/slug flow regime, bubbly/annular alternating flow and annular/mist alternating flow have been observed. In the present paper the model of heat and mass transfer in <b>microchannels</b> system has been proposed. Oscillations between quasi steady state of boiling in <b>microchannels</b> have been considered. Changes of two-phase flow in <b>microchannels</b> have been described by the relations between: heating surface temperature, vapour quality, liquid mass flux, pressure drop in <b>microchannels</b> and heat flux absorbed by boiling liquid. Simulation results indicate that shape of curve pressure-drop-versus-flow-rate is responsible for appearance or disappearance of heating surface temperature and pressure oscillations. dc 201...|$|R

25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a <b>microchannel</b> plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|Conventional FT {{reactors}} {{have been}} optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gas–liquid facilities such as Shell's Pearl GTL facility. These slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are {{much larger than}} the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields. The use of <b>microchannel</b> reactors, such as those developed by Velocys, intensifies the reaction, scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional FT technology. Enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control, which maximizes catalyst activity and life. While no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation, indications show capital costs, operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional FT facilities.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} recognized under the U.S. generation categories, Super Second Generation or SuperGen {{was developed in}} 1989 by Jacques Dupuy and Gerald Wolzak. This technology improved the tri-alkali photocathodes to more than double their sensitivity while also improving the <b>microchannel</b> plate by increasing the open-area ratio to 70% while reducing the noise level. This allowed second generation tubes, which are more economical to manufacture, to achieve comparable results to third generation image intensifier tubes. With sensitivities of the photocathodes approaching 700 uA/lm and extended frequency response to 950nm, this technology continued to be developed outside of the U.S., notably by Photonis and now forms the basis for most non-US manufactured high-end night vision equipment.|$|E

25|$|All the {{electrons}} {{move in a}} straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves collimation, and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until they hit a phosphor screen {{at the other end of}} the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the phosphor screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the <b>microchannel</b> plate stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The phosphor is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce phosphor screens produced green light (hence the soldiers' nickname 'green TV' for image intensification devices).|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the <b>MicroChannel</b> Plate, this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringAn {{investigation}} was conducted for fluid flow through <b>microchannels</b> {{to obtain a}} working correlation {{that can be used}} for any material and most commonly used Newtonian fluid. The <b>microchannels</b> that were studied had a hydraulic diameter ranging from 100 - 500 μm, with the flow in the laminar region (Re < 1500) and fluids we considered were Newtonian. This investigation showed that the surface roughness alters the fluid flow in <b>microchannels.</b> Studying the results, the authors showed that when predicting fluid flow in <b>microchannels,</b> the surface roughness must be considered. Two correlations were developed for the prediction of the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of fluid flow in microchannels; both correlations take into account the material surface roughness. Additionally, the study shows that in order to minimize the pressure drop in <b>microchannels,</b> a smaller surface roughness may be helpful. However, the opposite is true for heat transfer characteristics.
