She and Scamper earned {{national}} recognition after winning the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993. The duo also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Barrel Racing Average title seven times. They are also known for a particular <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> when Scamper's bridle fell off, yet they still won the round. James retired Scamper in 1993. James retired from competition in 2003 after winning an 11th WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> for South Carolina was the {{creation}} of the Regulators in the 1760s, one of the first organized militias in the New World. The militia proposed ideas of independence and brought increased recognition to the need for backcountry rights in the Carolinas. This led to the War of the Regulators, a battle between the regulators and the British soldiers, led mainly by British Royal Governor William Tryon, in the area. This battle was the first catalyst in the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|By that <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history,</b> Carol had {{established}} his National Renaissance Front dictatorship, and, in 1940, appointed Ion Gigurtu {{to lead a}} government that included some Iron Guard members. Gomoiu also joined, serving as Gigurtu's Health Minister from July 4 to September 4. In this capacity, and also {{as a member of}} the Crown Council, he was marginally involved in the major international crisis which saw the cession of Romanian land to the Soviet Union and the Axis Powers. On the night of August 29–30, he was among a majority of ministers who voted to peacefully cede the regions of Northern Transylvania to Regency Hungary. Gomoiu kept his ministerial office during the first government of Ion Antonescu, from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the National Legionary State and Carol's flight from the country. Reportedly, he resented Antonescu's alliance with the Iron Guard, and avoided politics altogether.|$|E

25|$|The MCG’s {{most famous}} <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> was {{as the main}} stadium for the 1956 Olympic Games. The MCG {{was only one of}} seven {{possible}} venues, including the Melbourne Showgrounds, for the Games’ main arena. The MCG was the Federal Government’s preferred venue but there was resistance from the MCC. The inability to decide on the central venue nearly caused the Games to be moved from Melbourne. Prime Minister Robert Menzies recognised the potential embarrassment to Australia if this happened and organised a three-day summit meeting to thrash things out. Attending was Victorian Premier John Cain, Sr., the Prime Minister, deputy opposition leader Arthur Calwell, all State political leaders, civic leaders, Olympic officials and trustees and officials of the MCC. Convening the meeting was no small effort considering the calibre of those attending and that many of the sports officials were only part-time amateurs.|$|E

Cameron's occult beliefs strongly affected her artworks. According to Priscilla Frank, writing for The Huffington Post, Cameron's artwork merges [...] "Crowley's occult with the surrealism and symbolism of French poets, yielding dark yet whimsical depictions buzzing with otherworldly power". The art curator Philippe Vergne described her work as being on [...] "the edge of surrealism and psychedelia", embodying [...] "an aspect of modernity that deeply doubts and defies cartesian logic at a <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> when these values have shown their own limitations".|$|E

500|$|The Concert for Bangladesh is {{continually}} viewed {{in a highly}} favourable light by critics in retrospective reviews.

[...] Writing in Rolling Stone that year, Anthony DeCurtis said: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh is rightly enshrined in rock history {{as the model for}} Band Aid, Live Aid, Live 8 and every other superstar benefit concert of the last three decades... In emphasizing the concert's idealism, however, it's easy to overlook what a musical gem this two-disc set is." [...] Dan Ouellette of Billboard considered that [...] "The star-studded package holds up well as a live greatest-hits collection", before concluding: [...] "But the revelation is the exhilarating concert lift-off, the improv-laced eastern Indian classical tune 'Bangla Dhun,' featuring sitar master Ravi Shankar." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Amor Prohibido was {{regarded}} as [...] "highly popular" [...] in Hispanic communities.

With Amor Prohibido, Selena catapulted Tejano music to [...] "an unprecedented level of mainstream success" [...] and brought it to areas unfamiliar with the genre. The album popularized Tejano music among a younger and wider audience {{than at any other time}} in the genre's history, while its sales were [...] "unprecedented". The album was instrumental in popularizing Tejano music and has been credited for [...] " [...] Tejano music on the map." [...] Amor Prohibido was the first record many young Hispanic females bought [...] "with lyrics in the language [...] blood is rooted in." [...] With Amor Prohibido, Selena [...] "made the voices and experiences of Latinos in the United States visible."

500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense.

500|$|So {{is often}} {{regarded}} as Gabriel's best album, {{as well as}} one of the best albums of the 1980s. It enabled Gabriel to transform from a cult artist, acclaimed for his cerebral, experimental solo work, into a mainstream, internationally known star. Rolling Stone placed So at 187 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and at 14 on its 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, noting that [...] "despite its mass appeal, however, So also presented compelling challenges." [...] Stereogum placed it at number one on its list of Gabriel's best albums, writing, [...] "Peter Gabriel's fifth studio album is a mesmerizing dichotomy: simultaneously hooky and experimental; timeless, yet completely crystallizing its <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history...</b> It's a masterpiece. It has been profiled in the Classic Albums series and featured in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Slant Magazine listed the album at 41 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, describing it as [...] "Gabriel's most accessible yet ambitious work. A chronicle of political, emotional, and artistic exploration, the album [...] to balance standard pop orthodoxy with his still-rumbling desire for sonic experimentation". Conversely, The Guardians lead critic Alexis Petridis claimed Gabriel [...] "suffered a musical mid-life crisis", describing it as [...] "an album packed with ultra-commercial priapic cod-funk" [...] and [...] "a ruthless bid for mainstream success".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1940 convention, Roosevelt {{described}} Willkie's nomination as a [...] "Godsend to our country", because it {{ensured that the}} presidential race would not turn {{on the issue of}} aid to Britain. Walter Lippmann believed Willkie's nomination to have been crucial to Britain's survival, [...] "second only to the Battle of Britain, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [...] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned". Charles Peters wrote that [...] "it is arguable that [...] impact on [...] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [...] At a crucial <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history,</b> he stood for the right things at the right time." [...] When Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he urged unity instead of partisan strife in the War on Terror, and recalled Willkie's actions, [...] "He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time.

500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".|$|E
