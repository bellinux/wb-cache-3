50|$|A MUGA scan (<b>multigated</b> {{acquisition}} scan) is {{a nuclear}} medicine test designed {{to evaluate the}} function of the right and left ventricles of the heart, thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. MUGA scanning is also called radionuclide angiography, equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA scanning (synchronized <b>multigated</b> acquisition scanning). This mode of imaging uniquely provides a cine type of image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual heart valves and chambers. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust adjunct to the now more common echocardiogram. Mathematics regarding acquisition of Q is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting ejection fraction as a product of the heart/myocardium in systole. The advantage of a MUGA scan over an echocardiogram or an angiogram is due to its accuracy. An echocardiogram measures the shortening fraction of the ventricle and is limited by the user's ability. Furthermore, an angiogram is invasive and, often, more expensive. A MUGA scan provides a more accurate representation of cardiac ejection fraction.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the jet diameter {{measured by a}} <b>multigated</b> pulsed Doppler system {{could be used to}} assess the severity of valve disease in children with pulmonary (n = 11) or aortic (n = 4) valve stenosis.

There was good agreement between the diameter of the disturbed region on the Doppler echocardiogram and the diameter of the jet on the lateral angiocardiogram. In severe valve stenosis the agreement between the valve diameters measured by <b>multigated</b> pulsed Doppler and at operation was also good. In less severe valve stenosis Doppler measurements systematically underestimated the valve diameter at operation.

40|$|Abstract Using the new {{myocardial}} perfusion agent 99 mTc-sestamibi and <b>multigated</b> acquisition on {{a nuclear}} medicine gamma camera, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was derived in 13 patients with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD).

Twenty-one patients were studied; 10 had normal coronary arteries and 11 had significant coronary artery disease. Twenty patients (10 with normal coronary arteries and 10 with coronary artery disease) also had <b>multigated</b> radionuclide blood pool scans at rest and with exercise.

Eight of the 10 patients with coronary artery disease who had rest and exercise radionuclide scans had an abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise. However, only 4 of the 10 control patients who had <b>multigated</b> scans had a normal ejection fraction response, although all showed normal regional wall motion with exercise.

40|$|New {{antitumor}} {{agents have}} resulted in significant survival benefits for cancer patients. However, several agents may have serious cardiovascular side effects. Left ventricular ejection fraction measurement by (99 m) Tc <b>multigated</b> radionuclide angiography {{is regarded as the}} gold standard to measure cardiotoxicity in adult patients. It identifies left ventricular dysfunction with high reproducibility and low interobserver variability. A decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, however, is a relatively late manifestation of myocardial damage. Nuclear cardiologic techniques that visualize pathophysiologic processes at the tissue level could detect myocardial injury at an earlier stage. These techniques may give the opportunity for timely intervention to prevent further damage and could provide insights into the mechanisms and pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity caused by anticancer agents. This review provides an overview of past, current, and promising newly developed radiopharmaceuticals and describes the role and recent advances of scintigraphic techniques to measure cardiotoxicity. Both first-order functional imaging techniques (visualizing mechanical [pump] function), such as (99 m) Tc <b>multigated</b> radionuclide angiography and (99 m) Tc gated blood-pool SPECT, and third-order functional imaging techniques (visualizing pathophysiologic and neurophysiologic processes at the tissue level) are discussed.

BACKGROUND Wall shear rate/stress and arterial reactivity are rarely assessed at the same time.

METHODS A new noninvasive evaluation of WSR in the brachial artery, using <b>multigated,</b> pulsed Doppler velocimeter and a double-transducer probe moved and fixed by a robotic system, was developed.

In 10 men and 10 women of similar age, induction of low and high shear rates by forearm occlusion produced significant vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. The time lag for maximal BAD changes was 3 min for vasocon-striction and 1 min for vasodilation. A greater half-time for vasodilation (96 6 for men and 86 12 s for women) than for shear rate (31 5 s for men and 34 4 s for women) was observed after discontinuation of occlusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{dependence of}} posture and exercise {{on the degree}} of mitral regurgitation using combined first pass and equilibrium radionuclide cardiography. DESIGN [...] 24 patients with clinically stable chronic mitral regurgitation and sinus rhythm were studied by first pass list mode and simultaneous <b>multigated</b> frame mode equilibrium radionuclide cardiography using red cells labelled with technetium- 99 m. RESULTS [...] When patients changed posture from supine to sitting upright, left ventricular volumes decreased considerably. Regurgitation tended to increase in patients with valve prolapse but decreased in patients with ischaemic heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. During submaximal bicycle exercise cardiac output increased without dilatation of the left ventricle. The increase in left ventricular forward stroke volume was more pronounced than that in the total stroke volume, leading to a considerable decrease in the regurgitant flow through the mitral valve. The repeatability and observer variability of radionuclide determination of regurgitation was acceptable, with limits of agreement within about 10 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] Change in posture induces a normal haemodynamic response in most patients with chronic mitral regurgitation; the effect of posture on regurgitation depends on the underlying disease. Mild to moderate exercise causes no deterioration in the severity of regurgitation...|$|E
