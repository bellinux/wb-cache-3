5|$|One of {{the first}} cover {{versions}} of the song was an acoustic version done by folk singer-songwriter John Wesley Harding, for his 1989 extended play, God <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> It: The Christmas EP. The 1999 and 2000 compilation albums, Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, included a cover of the track by singer Loleatta Holloway and electro-industrial band Bigod 20, respectively. Another version was recorded in 2002 by Hi-NRG/Eurodance group Mad'House, and was included in their album Absolutely Mad. It was released as a single and was a commercial success, reaching {{the top of the}} charts in Austria, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, the top ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia regions), France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and the top twenty in Denmark and Sweden. On the Billboard European Hot 100 Singles chart, it reached a peak of number two. A folk music cover of the song by Lavender Diamond was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness.|$|E

Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> It by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. Not even in the heyday of [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music." [...] Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music. Reeves said it introduced black consciousness to the [...] "hip-hop youth" [...] of the [...] "post-black power generation", [...] "as leather African medallions made popular by rappers like P.E. replaced thick gold chains as the ultimate fashion statement ... P.E.'s million seller sat at the front of a full-blown black pride resurgence within rap".|$|E

2500|$|Their second album, <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> It, {{released}} in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the Gothenburg style (with bands such as At the Gates, etc.) more than old-school thrash metal {{that was used}} on The Haunted. It is originally called <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> It, but it is meant for the band name {{to be included in}} the title. [...] "The Haunted <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> It" [...] topped CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart in four weeks, and won a Swedish Grammy for Best Hard Rock Album. The album was followed by European tours with Entombed and Nile, The Crown in U.K., and In Flames in Japan. The Haunted played on festivals such as 2000 Decibel, Hultsfred (both in Sweden), Graspop (Belgium), and Wacken Open Air (Germany). The band subsequently released their first live album - Live Rounds in Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|Many episodes use outlandish defense {{scenarios}} such as diminished responsibility (e.g. [...] "Genetics"/"Television"/"God"/"the devil <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] and intoxication defence) {{and temporary}} insanity (e.g. [...] "Black Rage"/"White Rage"/"Sports Rage"). Some episodes revolve around {{moral and ethical}} debates {{including the right to}} die (euthanasia), the right to life (abortion), and {{the right to bear arms}} (gun control). Episodes usually end with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the District Attorney's office, where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defense scenarios that were used, or the moral or ethical issue that was central to the episode.|$|E

He assured Siminovsky that if he followed Garson's instructions: [...] "The worst possible scenario is a win.... You're in good shape. You're a winner either way. And your schmuck [...] doesn't deserve it." [...] Garson dictated to Siminovsky the exact language the lawyer should use in a memo to Garson. He urged him to charge his client extra for the memo, saying: [...] "I am telling you, charge for it. This is extra; this was not contemplated; the judge <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it.... Squeeze the guy." [...] Referring to the estranged wife (Sigal Levi), the judge said: [...] "She's fucked." ...|$|E
2500|$|During August 2010, Blasko {{recorded}} an album, Seeker Lover Keeper, in New York for {{the group}} {{of the same name}} with fellow founding members and Australian singer-songwriters, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby. The group's debut album peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Charts in June 2011, Blasko's highest chart entry. The trio embarked on a national tour to promote the album in June and July that year. Of the album's 12 tracks each of the artists had an equal share of four tracks, however Blasko takes lead vocal on five tracks including [...] "Rely on Me" [...] written by Throsby, Blasko described [...] "I was reluctant to do it but the girls kept asking me.

2500|$|In the First Quarto, {{the same}} line reads: [...] "There's a predestinate {{providence}} {{in the fall of}} a sparrow." [...] Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word [...] "predestined" [...] appears in this one Quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time. Rulers and religious leaders feared that the doctrine of predestination would lead people to excuse the most traitorous of actions, with the excuse, [...] "God <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] English Puritans, for example, believed that conscience was a more powerful force than the law, due to the new ideas at the time that conscience came not from religious or government leaders, but from God directly to the individual.

[...] King James, as well, often wrote about his dislike of Protestant leaders' taste for standing up to kings, seeing it as a dangerous trouble to society. Throughout the play, Shakespeare mixes the two religions, making interpretation difficult. At one moment, the play is Catholic and medieval, in the next, it is logical and Protestant. Scholars continue to debate what part religion and religious contexts play in Hamlet.|$|E
