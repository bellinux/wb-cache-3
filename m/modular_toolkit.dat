The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and a set of fixturing elements, the set of placements of the fixturing elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). As fixturing problems occur frequently in manufacturing {{and assembly}}, it becomes costly to build a dedicated fixturing solution for each different problem. <b>Modular</b> fixturing <b>toolkits</b> offer the advantage of reusability of the fixturing elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity.

The approach is based on self-describing data, <b>modular</b> program <b>toolkits,</b> and scripts. Self-describing data provide a communication standard that aids the creation of <b>modular</b> program <b>toolkits</b> by allowing compliant programs {{to be used in}} essentially arbitrary combinations.

At APS, a group of about 70 data analysis, manipulation, and display tools is used in concert with about 20 control-system-specific tools to implement applications for commissioning and operations. High-level applications are created using scripts, which are relatively simple interpreted programs. The Tcl/Tk script language is used, allowing creating of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and a library of algorithms that are separate from the interface. This last factor allows greater automation of control by making it easy to take the human out of the loop. Applications of this methodology to operational tasks such as orbit correction, configuration management, and data review will be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Description The Lambert W {{framework}} {{is a new}} generalized way to analyze skewed, heavy-tailed data. Lambert W random variables (RV) are based on an input/ouput framework where the input is a RV X with distribution F(x), and the output Y = func(X) has similar properties as X (but slightly skewed or heavy-tailed). Then this transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution-for details see References. This package contains functions to perform a Lambert W analysis of skewed and heavy-tailed data: data can be simulated, parameters can be estimated from real world data, quantiles can be computed, and results plotted/printed in a 'nice ' way. Probably the most important function is 'Gaussianize', which works {{the same way as}} the R function 'scale ' but actually makes your data Gaussian.

40|$|Abstract Background Phyloinformatic {{analyses}} involve {{large amounts}} of data and metadata of complex structure. Collecting, processing, analyzing, visualizing and summarizing these data and metadata {{should be done in}} steps that can be automated and reproduced. This requires flexible, <b>modular</b> <b>toolkits</b> that can represent, manipulate and persist phylogenetic data and metadata as objects with programmable interfaces. Results This paper presents Bio::Phylo, a Perl 5 toolkit for phyloinformatic analysis. It implements classes and methods that are compatible with the well-known BioPerl toolkit, but is independent from it (making it easy to install) and features a richer API and a data model that is better able to manage the complex relationships between different fundamental data and metadata objects in phylogenetics. It supports commonly used file formats for phylogenetic data including the novel NeXML standard, which allows rich annotations of phylogenetic data to be stored and shared. Bio::Phylo can interact with BioPerl, thereby giving access to the file formats that BioPerl supports. Many methods for data simulation, transformation and manipulation, the analysis of tree shape, and tree visualization are provided. Conclusions Bio::Phylo is composed of 59 richly documented Perl 5 modules.

Developing nano-sized particles have become a critical issue in biomedical applications because they {{are closely related to}} quantum yield, large surface area and EPR effects. Despite these advantages of nanoparticles, it has become indispensable to use more advanced nanoparticles due to their chemical complexity, heterogeneity, difficulty in precisely controlling the size, and toxicity in vivo applications. In this regard, protein-based nanoparticles have biocompatibility, uniform size, shape, composition and stability, and they are quite suitable as multifunctional nanoplatforms. In addition, the structures of protein nanoparticles are based on the atomic resolution crystal structure allowing genetic and chemical modifications at the molecular level. The aim of this thesis was to describe of developing the multi-functional protein nanoparticles using protein cages and monomeric fusion proteins. Thus, Thermotoga maritima encapsulin protein cage whose outer diameter 24 nm was developed as in vitro theranostic nanoplatform. A novel protein cage, encapsulin have not been used for targeted delivery system before, and was prepared as a versatile template for targeted delivery through SP 94 peptide insertion which known to bind with hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Functional plasticity and versatility of the engineered encapsulin allow us to apply for specifically detecting and effective treatment of diseases. Relatively small lumazine synthase which isolated from Aquifex aeolicus (AaLS) protein cage nanoparticles with outer diameter of 15. 4 nm have been utilized to develop as uniform layer by layer assemblies.

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis and modeling of natural images {{is an important}} branch of statistics with applications in image signaling, image compression, computer vision, and human perception. Because the space of all possible images is too large to be sampled exhaustively, natural image models must inevitably make assumptions {{in order to stay}} tractable.

Broader adoption of microbial synthesis is hampered by a limited number of high-yielding natural pathways for molecules with the desired physical properties, as well as the difficulty in functionally assembling complex biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts. Here, we address both of these challenges by reporting the adaptation of the butanol biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of odd-chain molecules and the development of a complementary <b>modular</b> <b>toolkit</b> to facilitate pathway construction, characterization, and optimization in engineered Escherichia coli. The modular feature of our pathway enables multientry and multiexit biosynthesis of various odd-chain compounds at high efficiency. By varying combinations of the pathway and toolkit enzymes, we demonstrate controlled production of propionate, trans- 2 -pentenoate, valerate, and pentanol, compounds with applications that include biofuels, antibiotics, biopolymers, and aroma chemicals. Importantly, and in contrast to a previously used method to identify limitations in heterologous amorphadiene production, our bypass strategy was effective even without the presence of freely membrane-diffusible substrates.

The combination of these features could allow for the production of novel materials with unique or useful properties. Previous work has demonstrated the application of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles for colorimetric DNA detection, and ordered assemblies of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles have also been reported. Here, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) from a synchrotron source was used to characterize ordered assemblies of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles. The extracted structure factor obtained from these diffraction experiments confirmed the assembly of gold nanoparticles into crystallites with well-defined internal order, demonstrating the formation of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice structure. Applying basic principles of x-ray diffraction such as the Scherrer Formula, the interparticle spacing and average size of crystallite aggregates were determined.

In this paper, we present a <b>modular</b> <b>toolkit</b> to form supramolecular polymer networks that allows both these contributors to be controlled.

We follow this approach and prepare a set of different supramolecular polymer gel networks with mechanical properties that are quantitatively related to the strength of their constituent crosslinking complexes. Static light scattering reveals just minor nanometer scale polymer network inhomogeneity in some of the gels, whereas others exhibit non negligible nanostructural heterogeneity.

40|$|Abstract â€” The actual {{use of a}} {{wireless}} ad-hoc network or its operational parameters may be unknown before deployment or they may change during the life time of a network. This requires that an ad-hoc network be configurable to {{the unique needs of}} a client and that multiple clients can configure the network simultaneously. The QoS metric(s) used in the selection of routes in an ad-hoc routing protocol can strongly affect the networkâ€™s performance. Unfortunately, the majority of existing routing protocols support only one or two fixed metrics in route selection. We conducted a survey of over 40 routing protocols published from 1994 - 2007 which indicated that 90 % of the protocols use one or two metrics and only 10 % use three to four metrics in route selection. Toward this end, we propose a <b>modular</b> routing <b>toolkit</b> for ad-hoc networks, where users and applications can initiate route discoveries that best suit their QoS requirements. To achieve this, we introduce CMR (Configurable Mesh Routing), which enables network users to initiate route discoveries that establish routes customized to their unique needs (including multi-path routes with different QoS specifications for each path). Our experiments on a 20 -node mesh testbed illustrate the ability of CMR to produce routes that mimic the behavior of existing protocols as well as its usefulness in deploying novel, customized, multi-QoS routes.
