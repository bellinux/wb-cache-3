5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored.

40|$|This note studies a {{model in}} which {{heterogeneous}} income agents get a utility boost only when their consumption catches up with the Joneses'. The resulting utility function is non-concave. In this setup, participation in a fair consumption lottery {{has the potential to}} make some agents ex-ante better off but <b>more</b> financially <b>vulnerable.</b> <b>More</b> income-diverse people join the lottery pool when the 'kick' from catching up increases. Worsening income inequality may increase the number of financially vulnerable people.

5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than 10-month-old ones.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a rare}} {{butterfly}} {{and declining}} due to changes in its habitat and is thus considered to be <b>vulnerable.</b> <b>More</b> information is needed on this species.|$|R
50|$|American {{planters}} {{responded to}} increased European demand by expanding {{the size and}} output of their plantations. The number of man-hours needed to sustain larger operations increased, which forced planters to acquire and accommodate additional slave labor. Furthermore, they had to secure larger initial loans from London, which increased pressure to produce a profitable crop and made them <b>more</b> financially <b>vulnerable</b> to natural disasters.|$|R

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
25|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} {{estrogen}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion– before full maturity in the third trimester– then <b>more</b> relatively <b>vulnerable</b> immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|R
30|$|The tenth {{factor is}} driven by {{extractive}} industry employment and explains 2.6  % of the variance. Populations that rely on extractive industries can face {{a long period of}} unemployment after disasters. If an entire region or city depends on extraction industry activities, major economic problems could occur {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster. The central portion of the country concentrates extractive industry activities that make these areas <b>more</b> socially <b>vulnerable</b> than other areas in the country (Fig.  3 j).|$|R

5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers {{have suggested that}} horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.|$|E
5|$|The Dorniers were {{to carry}} twenty 110-lb bombs each {{fitted with a}} fuse that would allow for {{function}} if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to ground fire.|$|E

5|$|Wild {{populations of}} Caprellamutica show {{a higher number}} of females than males.

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to hunting.|$|E
