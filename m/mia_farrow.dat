5000|$|A 1982 Variety {{reviewer}} {{praised the}} script and voice acting but was not impressed by the film's animation. [...] "However vapid the unicorn may appear to the eye, <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's</b> voice brings an almost moving plaintive quality to the character." [...] The review also praised the vocal talents of Arkin, Lee, and Frees.|$|R

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|Parker starred with Kevin Kline in Grand Canyon (1991); with Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Jessica Tandy in Fried Green Tomatoes (1991); with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones in The Client (1994); with John Cusack in Bullets over Broadway (1994); {{and with}} Drew Barrymore and Whoopi Goldberg in Boys on the Side (1995), {{as a woman}} with AIDS. Parker's next role was in a movie {{adaptation}} of another Craig Lucas play, Reckless (1995), alongside <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow,</b> followed by Jane Campion's The Portrait of a Lady (1996), which also starred Nicole Kidman, Viggo Mortensen, Christian Bale, John Malkovich and Barbara Hershey.

25|$|Polanski {{returned}} to the United States, and was contracted {{by the head of}} Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct and write the screenplay for Rosemary's Baby, which was based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> was cast. Tate reportedly provided ideas for some of the key scenes, including the scene in which the protagonist, Rosemary, is impregnated. A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by Esquire and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film.|$|E
25|$|Paramount studio head Robert Evans brought Polanski to America {{ostensibly to}} direct the film Downhill Racer, but told Polanski that {{he really wanted to}} him to read the horror novel Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin to see if a film could be made out of it. Polanski read it {{non-stop}} through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks. The film, Rosemary's Baby (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse (<b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow),</b> a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.|$|E
25|$|Tina Brown {{was born}} in Maidenhead, England, {{and she and her}} elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a movie producer) grew up in Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, a Thames village in the {{countryside}} west of London. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow.</b> In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark and I never knew why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties to be with their daughter and grandchildren.|$|E

5000|$|Originally titled On the Edge, The Secret Life of Zoey was {{released}} in the United States on August 19, 2002 to mixed reviews. The script was viewed alternately as a fresh take on a clichéd premise, or another entrant in the mediocre teen anti-drug genre. The two female leads, Farrow and Whelan, were cited as the movie's bright spots. Whelan in particular was noted for the emotional depth and naturalness of her performance; the Orlando Sentinel's Hal Boedeker {{went so far as}} to describe her as [...] "The sole reason to watch 'The Secret Life of Zoey'". [...] <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's</b> reviews were not so universally positive, but she was nominated for Best Performance in a TV movie or Miniseries at the 2003 PRISM Awards, which honor outstandingly realistic depictions of drug use, drug addiction and other dependence in film and television.|$|R
50|$|McCormack {{had been}} treated at a Bronx {{hospital}} for facial bruises three weeks before. She told a friend that Durst beat her, yet she did not press charges over the incident. McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 divorce settlement. Durst had cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition. At the time his wife disappeared, Durst had been dating <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's</b> sister Prudence {{for three years and}} was living in a separate apartment. Durst initially offered $100,000 for his wife's return, then reduced the reward to $15,000. Not long afterwards, he was seen discarding his wife's possessions, which he denied. When McCormack's friend and sister had heard she was reported missing, they broke into her cottage hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked and McCormack's mail left unopened. They then became afraid and left.|$|R
500|$|Sinatra {{reportedly}} {{broke off}} engagements to Lauren Bacall in 1958, and Juliet Prowse in 1962. He married <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> on July 19, 1966, a short marriage which ended with divorce in Mexico in August 1968. They remained close friends for life, {{and in a}} 2013 interview Farrow admitted that Sinatra might be {{the father of her}} son, Ronan Farrow (born 1987). In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning interview, Nancy Sinatra dismissed the claims as [...] "nonsense".|$|E

Before leaving for India, the band {{recorded}} the instrumental tracks for [...] "Across the Universe", whose refrain, [...] "Jai Guru Deva", was a standard greeting within the Maharishi's Spiritual Regeneration Movement. Also in January, the Maharishi, <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow,</b> Prudence Farrow and their brother flew from the US to London and on to India.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra {{was about}} to turn 50 and was heavily in the spotlight. [...] Sinatra's {{relationship}} with 20-year-old <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> was constantly in the news. [...] A CBS television documentary had upset Sinatra, who felt that his life was being pried into and was unhappy about speculation in the documentary about his connection to Mafia leaders. [...] He was also worried about his starring role in an upcoming NBC show named after his album, A Man and His Music and his various business ventures in real estate, his film company, his record label and an airline. [...] At the time, Sinatra maintained a personal staff of 75.|$|E
5000|$|Asked about longstanding {{speculation}} that Ronan Farrow {{is the son}} of <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's</b> ex-husband Frank Sinatra, Mia stated in a 2013 Vanity Fair article that Sinatra might [...] "possibly" [...] be Ronan's father. After the allegation became widespread in the news media, Ronan tweeted humorously on October 2, 2013, [...] "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son." [...] In February 7, 2014, Woody Allen expressed his uncertainty in The New York Times, writing, [...] "Is he my son or, as Mia suggests, Frank Sinatra's?" [...] In 2015, Vanity Fair asked Nancy Sinatra about Ronan being treated {{as if he were a}} member of their family. She answered in an e-mail, [...] "He is a big part of us, and we are blessed to have him in our lives." [...] No DNA testing has been reported to determine Farrow's paternity. According to Tina Sinatra, Frank Sinatra's youngest daughter, Frank Sinatra had previously undergone a vasectomy and could not have been Ronan's biological father.|$|R
50|$|The show's {{downfall}} {{began in}} September 1966. Ratings dropped after <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's</b> departure. Farrow never expected {{the show to}} become a success and immediately {{tried to get out}} of her contract when the show started its airing. On the urging of her then-husband, Frank Sinatra, the producers decided to write her off the show in the summer of 1966. The character Rachel Welles, portrayed by Leigh Taylor-Young, was written into the show as her replacement. The addition of Taylor-Young's character, however, was not successful in increasing the ratings. The show was cut back to two airings a week. By 1968, most of the original characters had been written out of the show, in many cases at their own request. Critics agreed the show had become 'dated' and, because of the constant change in characters, confusing as well. The writers, already beginning work on what would be the final season, announced several new characters would be written into the show. They would deal with 'electrifying subjects, the war, the draft, riots, music, God, and godlessness'. Although several well-known actors were added to the cast, including Ruby Dee, it was cancelled on June 2, 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, {{who called}} the miniseries a [...] "surprisingly clever remake", felt that the choice of Paris as the setting was not only [...] "one of the best things" [...] about the remake, but it works well with the theme of {{conflict}} with neighbors. Furthermore, she noted that it was reasonable that Rosemary (Zoe Saldana) would be naive and dependent because of her unfamiliarity with Paris as a newcomer. Stanley wrote that the host couple, French sophisticates Margaux (Carole Bouquet) and Roman Castevet (Jason Isaacs), were completely {{different from the one}} in Roman Polanski's original. Although she said the adaptation took liberties with the source material, James Poniewozik of Time said the adaptation [...] "keeps its essential shape and plot" [...] in comparison to the original film, an opinion shared by Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, who wrote that the new adaptation was [...] "surprisingly and even satisfyingly true to the old movie". Poniewozik stated that although director Holland had successfully directed complex and lively episodes of The Wire and Treme, this adaptation was [...] "leaden and slack", which may have been due to an attempt to fill two two-hour time slots. Stuever also wrote that it was [...] "way too long", and added that the show lacked suspense. Poniewozik characterized Rosemary and Guy (Patrick J. Adams) as [...] "anesthetically generic" [...] without a [...] "complex relationship"; he likened the miniseries to a [...] "lifestyle show" [...] that becomes a [...] "slasher movie". Despite some [...] "redeeming notes", he ultimately called it [...] "too dull". Stuever noted that the 2014 adaptation was set in [...] "the hyper-aware boutique pregnancy" [...] era, and pointed out one modernization that eased Rosemary's burden: Google image searches on Satan. David Bianculli of NPR felt the shift to Paris was unnecessary and that the adaptation was [...] "neither refreshing nor original"; he summed it up as [...] "just dreadful". He described Saldana's Rosemary as more appealing but no smarter than <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow's.</b>|$|R
500|$|As soon as Starr {{arrived in}} Delhi he asked Evans {{to take him}} to a doctor because of a {{reaction}} to an inoculation: [...] "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say it will be all right". Also there at the same time were <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow,</b> her sister Prudence and brother John, Donovan, Gyp [...] "Gypsy Dave" [...] Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, journalist Lewis H. Lapham, film-maker Paul Saltzman, socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera, actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin, and dozens of others, all Europeans or Americans. Despite speculation, Shirley MacLaine did not attend and Lennon, who had thought of bringing Yoko Ono, decided against it.|$|E
500|$|Some {{business}} negotiations concerned arrangements for a film. According to Cooke de Herrera the Maharishi {{had given the}} Beatles and their Apple Corporation the rights for a movie about the Maharishi, his movement and his teacher, Guru Dev. While their [...] "people and equipment were on the way", Charles Lutes, {{the head of the}} Maharishi's Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the US arrived and signed a contract with Four Star Films. The contract was negotiated by Horn and John Farrow was scheduled to direct the film. Horn expected that Donovan, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> would appear in it. When some of the film crew from Four Star Films arrived around 11 April, Harrison and Lennon stayed out of sight. Cooke de Herrera felt the contract with Four Star Films and presence of the film crew was the reason for the sudden departure of Harrison and Lennon and Horn said it was the catalyst for their discontent.|$|E
500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow.</b> This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E
500|$|<b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow,</b> who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his arms around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname [...] "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him [...] "the greatest singer of the 20th century", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "world press" [...] {{arrived at}} the ashram gate and the Maharishi asked {{them to come back}} after the Beatles had had [...] "a little time with the course". According to author and course participant, Cooke de Herrera, the Beatles were [...] "very happy at the way it was done". De Herrara wrote in her memoir that the Maharishi gave [...] "special attention" [...] to all the celebrities despite her {{warnings}} not to feed their egos. <b>Mia</b> <b>Farrow</b> wrote that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi's attention to her, including private sessions, gifts of mangoes, and a birthday party where he gave her a paper crown. Early the following morning the Maharishi arranged for a group photo and told everyone where to sit. [...] Since it was her birthday the day before, Mia was asked to sit in the centre and each student was adorned with a marigold garland. [...] All sat on a podium and the Maharishi had a large picture of his guru, Brahmananda Saraswati, behind him. The photo took half an hour and has been described as [...] "one of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock 'n' roll". Photographers included Paul Saltzman, a Canadian filmmaker who was visiting the ashram after completing film work elsewhere in India. Saltzman's snapshots from this time were later assembled into a book, The Beatles in India (2000).|$|E
