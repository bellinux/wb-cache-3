40|$|ABSTRACT: During last decades Brazilian {{electric}} {{sector has}} suffered a huge financial crisis, such situation does not allowing the investments needed to guarantee energy supply. Besides that, electricity consumption is growing significantly since 1994 due to the <b>monetary</b> <b>stabilisation</b> policy introduced by Federal Government. Recent official planning [1] considers {{the construction of new}} thermal plants in short term, to avoid the risks the deficit, but it depends upon the participation of private investments, which are possible now, due to the sector’s privatisation. Regarding this situation, the purchase of surplus electricity from cogenerators, like sugar/alcohol or pulp/paper plants, is a feasible and important option to complement the energy offer. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a social and political overview of the situation and existing barriers of biomass-origin cogeneration, mainly from sugarcane bagasse.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of the European monetary union moving ahead on schedule has recently revived the discussion on stabilisation policies. The starting point of this discussion has been the observation that, because of relatively low labour mobility {{and the presence of}} country-specific shocks, monetary policy at the EC-level might not have the capacity to satisfy national stabilisation objectives. If it leaves economies more exposed to aggregate shocks, the loss of national <b>monetary</b> <b>stabilisation</b> instruments may prove costly and require the Community to insure against regional shocks by use of the other instrument at her disposal: fiscal policy. This paper addresses two main issues. First, it investigates the extent to which macroeconomic stabilisation is desirable {{from the point of view}} of the consumer in the European Community, by estimating the perceived costs of consumption instability. Second, being aware that consumption shocks can probably not be entirely eliminated and the individual countries' consumption risk could at best be diversified through an EC-level insurance mechanism, we focus explicitly on the benefits of such a stabilisation policy. Our estimations are based on three alternative models for consumption: a trend stationary, a random walk and an autoregressive model. The results show that traditional stabilisation policies associated with temporary shocks may not generate significant benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} {{experiencing}} {{an increasing number}} of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries (think of NAFTA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, APEC, the Euromediterranean Partnership, or the free trade agreements between the EU and Turkey, Mexico, South Africa or Mercosur and between the United States and Jordan, most of them still in the transitory period before full implementation). However, most of these schemes are being implemented out of a blind confidence in the positive effects of trade liberalisation regardless of the framework conditions, without much true empirical evidence on their impact on developing countries, let alone a serious reconsideration of the standard trade integration (custom unions) theory to adapt it to the special circumstances of developing countries. Due to the high social transformation potential of international trade, this could ultimately prove a dangerous economic engineering experiment for the development prospects of less developed countries, particularly the smaller ones. After a brief summary of the conventional trade integration theory, the paper refers to five aspects of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries which are not tackled by the this theory and which could question its assumptions predictions: the (high) import and (low) export elasticities which might prove wrong the positive impact on the current account balance of trade liberalisation; the possible working of economies of agglomeration favouring concentration of economic activities in more developed areas of a free-trade area; the eventual preference for industry in low-competitiveness countries which without a certain level of protection might lose any chance of industrialisation; the impact of those free-trade areas on inward foreign direct investment into developing countries, which might be actually negative; and the macroeconomic and political sustainability (far from granted) of those free trade areas. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} need to adapt conventional trade integration theory to the particular case of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries, and this cannot be done from a purely trade theory perspective, but must also take into account development theory and political economy considerations. In any case, a preliminary analysis seems to indicate that this new framework could favour "deep" integration schemes (where trade liberalisation is supplemented by certain legislative harmonisation, <b>monetary</b> <b>stabilisation</b> schemes and even a sizeable resource transfer from developed to developing countries to support the transition process and compensate the losers) instead of the more frequent "hollow" integration processes (consisting of mere trade barriers removal).

We use a proportional tax rate instead of lump sum tax and introduce the distortions of a tax wedge. We derive a closed economy forward-looking model with government consumption and no capital. Households’ labour supply decisions are endogenised. Monetary policy is conducted by a Taylor-type interest rate rule and fiscal policy follows a simple debt rule. We analyse {{the stability of the}} model when fiscal policy has both demand and supply- side effects and compare results with the standard case of only demand effects. We show that taking supply-side effects into account restricts the fiscal policy parameter range consistent with the dynamic stability of the economy. We also argue that allowing fiscal policy to affect both supply and demand results in more persistent inflation as well as output responses to shocks, than without the supply-side channel. We also discuss the different monetary and fiscal policy regimes and their implication on the stability of inflation and output. inflation, fiscal and <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>stabilisation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Moldovan leu {{has been accompanied}} by a monetary stabilization policy that until 1998 proved {{to be one of the}} most successful among FSU countries. The leu showed a remarkable stability and the rate of inflation was brought down to around 10 % in 1997. However, fiscal policy was driven by inertia and pressure groups, reflecting the slow path of structural reforms and the general weakness of the state. Loose fiscal policy in turn reduced the determination in reforming state structures. Arrears and nettingout operations led to the development of the non-payment culture. At macroeconomic level, expansionary fiscal policy led to high absorption in the economy that was not met by the supply side response due to the impeded restructuring process, which fuelled imports and deteriorated trade balance. The ultimate result of the policy mix was the rapid accumulation of external debt and expenditure arrears. The unsustainability of both internal and external position of the state led to the inevitable financial crisis. The turmoil that followed in 1998 the crisis in Russia was a catalyst that speeded up the collapse of monetary stabilization. The capital account losses (capital flight) immediately brought the country to the verge of default. The abrupt and probably persistent loss of major export markets will affect the real economic activity over a longer period. More over, the crisis may create a window opportunity for accelerating Moldovan reforms. A critical situation makes the public and policy makers more likely to accept the painful measures that are necessary to revert the negative tendencies accumulated in recent years, while the large external debt makes the country fully dependent on the co-operation with international organizations, especially the IMF. Indeed, the new cabinet of young and liberal reformers voted in March 1999 initiated a more energetic program of reforms. Likewise, the decline of exports to Russia forced Moldovan enterprises to search new export possibilities for many producers trying to enter non-traditional western markets. The remainder of this paper is organised in the following way. The first chapter describes the {{introduction of}} the national currency and <b>monetary</b> <b>stabilisation</b> observed in Moldova in years 1993 ­ 1997.

It abstracts from key factors favouring currency union formation, such as reduced transaction costs and enhanced credibility, which are exogenous to the factors studied here. Demand-side shocks hamper <b>monetary</b> union <b>stabilisation</b> unless members face identical output-inflation tradeoffs and their business cycles are perfectly synchronised. Under supply shocks, welfare implications from joining a currency union are less clear cut. In particular, when these shocks are common across participating countries a tradeoff arises whereby the latter benefit {{if they are}} relatively open but are at a disadvantage in case they are of small size. Monetary-fiscal interaction leads to a free rider problem, with area-wide supply shocks eliciting higher interest rate variability. Compared with the case of real wage rigidity, increased real wage flexibility mitigates the free rider problem. Higher trade union decentralisation overall favours a currency union. The present multi-country currency union setup should {{not be seen as}} an attempt at settling the sharp differences that exist in the literature.

Active use of public spending raises aggregate welfare because it enables a more balanced distribution of the stabilisation burden across asset-holding and non-asset-holding consumers. The optimal response of government expenditure is sensitive to the financing scheme and whether the policymaker has access to a targeted transfer that can directly redistribute resources between consumers.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{macroeconomic}} use of national fiscal policy in EMU and examines the rational and scope for a collective insurance system which redistributes income among countries {{in response to}} asymmetric cyclical shocks. The analysis of the record of national fiscal policies {{before and after the}} adoption of the Maastricht Treaty finds evidence that the quality of fiscal policies has improved in two ways: they are more clearly countercyclical - or less procyclical - and they are more readily used to restore competitiveness than to attempt to boost demand when competitiveness is eroded. These observations suggest that fiscal policy remains a useful instrument. One question is whether it can be augmented - or perhaps substituted for - with a collective insurance system. Collective insurance is one alternative to external borrowing and lending and therefore one {{way to deal with the}} concerns that the SGP is meant to address. We examine in more detail two collective insurance systems: tax revenue sharing and unemployment insurance sharing. We find that the earlier is more promising and examine in some detail how it could be set up. It is no panacea, though.

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} {{the process by which}} the central bank of a country {{controls}} the supply of money, the availability of money, and the cost of money or rate of interest, in order to attain a set of objectives oriented towards the growth and stability of the economy. Fiscal policy induced demand management approach as propagated by Keynes, which was popular in the postGreat Depression period, later made way to <b>monetary</b> policy led <b>stabilisation</b> approach in the period of high inflation of 1970 s. While traditional fiscal policy solutions were useful in confronting unemployment by increasing spending and cutting taxes, counteracting inflation entailed reducing spending or raising taxes. The growing importance of monetary policy and the diminishing role played by fiscal policy in economic stabilisation efforts may reflect both political and economic realities. Monetary and fiscal policies differ in the speed with which each takes effect as the time lags are variable. Monetary policy is flexible (rates can be changed each month) and emergency rate changes can be made, whereas changes in taxation take longer to organise and implement. Also, considerable time may pass between the decision to adopt a government spending programme and its implementation. During the period of Golden Growth covering late 1980 s till the recent past, in the mix of macroeconomic policies, monetary policy continued to reserve a place of prominence. However, in the backdrop of global financial meltdown and subsequent confusion in macroeconomic theories, a new quest has emerged in redefining the role and instruments of macroeconomic policy in fostering economic development. It may be recalled that the main objectives of a classic monetary policy are to maintain a stable and low rate of inflation, high capacity utilisation to sustain a low rate of unemployment, and a high trend of economic growth and effective exchange rate management to maintain stability between exporters and consumers interest. Explicit articulation of monetary policy at the behest of an independent central bank ensures transparency in the economic policy making and has become popular in managing expectations of the major stakeholders. In Bangladesh, Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) was first issued by the Bangladesh Bank in January 2006. The intention was to present information on Bangladesh Bank's outlook on real sector and monetary developments over the immediate future and the monetary policy stance it will pursue, based on its assessment of the developments over the preceding period. In continuation to this tradition, on 19 July 2009, the eighth issue of half yearly Monetary Policy Statement was announced for JulyDecember, FY 200910 period. The present analytical commentary sets off by providing a brief overview of evolution of monetary policy stances of the Bangladesh Bank as espoused in its recent policy statements.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{monetary policy}} is evaluated by examining monetary policy shocks represented {{by changes in}} nominal interest rates rather than changes in the money supply. In this thesis, we studied three interrelated concepts: the monetary policy transmission mechanism, interest rate spreads and the spread adjusted monetary policy rule. Chapter 1 sets out a theoretical background by reviewing the evolution of monetary policy from money growth targeting to the standard approach of interest rate targeting (pegging) in the new consensus. The new consensus perspective models the economy with a system of three equations: the dynamic forward-looking IS-curve for aggregate demand, an inflation expectation-augmented Phillips curve and the interest rate rule. Monetary policy is defined as fixing the nominal interest rate in order to exert influences on macroeconomic outcomes such as output and expected inflation while allowing the money supply {{to be determined by}} interest rate and inflation expectations. Having set out this background, Chapter 2 empirically investigates long-standing questions: how does monetary policy (interest rate policy) affect the economy and how effective is it? This chapter seeks to answer these questions by modelling a monetary policy framework using macroeconomics data from Namibia. Using the new consensus macroeconomic view, this empirical analysis starts from the assumption that money is endogenous, and thus it identifies the bank rate (i. e. Namibia’s repo rate) as the policy instrument which starts the monetary transmission mechanism. We estimated a SVAR and derived structural impulse response functions and cumulative impulse response functions, which showed how output, inflation and bank credit responded to structural shocks, specifically the monetary policy and credit shocks in the short run and the long run. We found that in the short run quarterly real GDP, inflation and private credit declined significantly in response to monetary policy shocks in Namibia. Monetary policy shocks as captured by an unsystematic component of changes in the repo rate considerably caused a sharp decrease for more than three quarters ahead after the first impact in quarterly real GDP. Furthermore, structural impulse response functions showed that real GDP and inflation increased in response to one standard deviation in the private credit shock. In the long run, the cumulative impulse response functions showed that inflation declined and remained below the initial level while responses in other variables were statistically insignificant. South African monetary policy shock caused significant negative responses in private; however, the impacts on quarterly GDP were barely statistically significant in the short run. In all, this empirical evidence shows that the monetary policy of changing the level of repo rate is effective in stabilising GDP, inflation rate and private credit in the short run; and in the long run domestic monetary policy significantly stabilises inflation too. The structural forecast error variance decompositions show that the variations of output attributed to interest rate shock show that the interest rate channel is relatively strong compared with the credit channel. This is substantiated by the fact that repo rate shocks account for a large variation in output compared with the variation attributed to private credit shock. We conclude in this chapter that domestic monetary policy through the repo rate is effective, while the effects from the South African policy rate are not emphatically convincing in Namibia. Therefore, the Central Bank should keep independent monetary policy actions in order to achieve the goals of price stability. In Chapter 3 we investigate the subject of ‘interest rate spreads’, which are seen as the transmitting belts of monetary policy effects in the economy. While it is widely acknowledged that the monetary policy transmission mechanism is very important, {{it is also clear that}} the successes of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>stabilisation</b> are influenced by the size of spreads in the economy. Interest spreads are double-edged swords, as they amplify and also dampen monetary effects in the economy. Hence, we investigate the unit root process with structural breaks in interest rate spreads, and the macroeconomic and financial fundamentals that seem to explain large changes in spreads in Namibia. Firstly, descriptive statistics show that spreads always exist and gravitate around the mean above zero and that their paths are significantly amplified during crisis periods. Secondly, the Lanne, Saikkonen and Lutkepohl (2002) unit root test for processes with structural breaks shows that spreads have unit root with structural breaks. Most significant endogenous structural breaks identified coincide with the 1998 East Asia financial crisis period, while the global financial crisis only caused a significant structural break in quarterly GDP. Thirdly, using the definitions of the changes in base spread and retail spread, we find that inflation, unconditional inflation, economic growth rate and interest rate volatilities, and changes in the bank rate and risk premium and South Africa’s spread are some of the significant macroeconomic factors that explain changes in interest rate spread in Namibia. Whether we define interest spread as the retail spread, that is, the difference between average lending rate and average deposit rate, or the base spread, which is the difference between prime lending rate and the bank rate, our empirical results indicate that there macroeconomics and financial fundamentals play a statistically significant role in the determination of interest rate spreads. In the last chapter, we estimate the monetary policy rule augmented with spread - the so called Spread-adjusted Taylor Rule (STR). The simple Spread-adjusted Taylor rule is suggested in principle to be used as simple monetary policy strategy that responds to economic or financial shocks, e. g. rising spreads. In an environment of stable prices or weak demand, rising spreads have challenged current new consensus monetary policy strategy. As a result, the monetary policy framework that attaches weight to inflation and output to achieve price stability has been deemed unable to respond sufficiently to financial stress in the face of financial instability. In response to this challenge, the STR explicitly takes into account the spread to address the weakness of the standard monetary policy reaction in the face of financial instability. We apply the Bayesian method to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters in the simple STR. We use theory-based informed priors and empirical Bayesian priors to estimate the posterior means of the STR model. Our results from this empirical estimation show that monetary policy reaction function can be adjusted with credit spread to caution against tight credit conditions and therefore realise the goal of financial stability and price stability simultaneously. The estimated coefficients obtained from the spread-adjusted monetary policy are consistent with the calibrated parameters suggested by (McCulley &# 38; Toloui, 2008) and (Curdia &# 38; Woodford, 2009). We find that, on average, a higher credit spread is associated with the probability that the policy target will be adjusted downwards by 55 basis points in response to a marginal increase of one per cent in equilibrium spread. This posterior mean is likely to vary between - 30 and - 79 basis points with 95...|$|R
