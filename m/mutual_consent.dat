5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow {{was never}} allowed to remarry, while it was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> and legal approval is sought.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 2016, Allardyce {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} to become {{manager of the}} England national team.

5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} <b>mutual</b> <b>consent,</b> while remarriage {{after the death of}} a spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E

On 11 November 2016, England beat Scotland 3–0 at Wembley. The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 21 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 22 draw.

5|$|In {{the final}} match of January, Benfica lost to Sporting CP and {{underwent}} another erratic period, losing two more league matches in February. A home win against Liverpool motivated them; they beat Porto and eliminated the reigning title-holders from the Champions League. This success was not replicated domestically; in mid-March, Benfica lost further {{ground in the}} Primeira Liga and were eliminated from the Portuguese Cup. Koeman's side recovered, but they were eliminated by Barcelona from the Champions League and failed to overtake Sporting when they dropped seven points in three match-days. At {{the end of the}} season, Koeman left the club by <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 Starosta {{returned}} to Poland and signed a one-year deal for II liga side Miedź Legnica with the option of extending the deal for another two seasons.

Miedź took up the option of extending his deal for him to remain with the club for the new season, however he subsequently left Legnica after the club cancelled his contract by <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{were viewed}} {{as one of the}} favourites for {{promotion}} in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b> Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead the Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored right at the end after a swift counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{finds the}} love she seeks in her second cousin, Captain Walter Marrable. He {{falls in love}} with her, and she joyously accepts his offer of marriage. However, misfortune strikes in the form of Colonel Marrable, the Captain's father, who swindles his son out of the fortune left him by his late mother. The impoverished Captain fears that he will have to return to India with his regiment; he and Mary, each unwilling to inflict poverty on the other, end their {{engagement}} by <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> and with mutual regret.|$|E
