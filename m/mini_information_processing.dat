40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{promising}} advantages for health information exchange (HIE) is improved patient safety. Up to 18 % of the patient safety errors generally and as many as 70 % of adverse drug events could be eliminated if the right information about the right patient is available at the right time. Health information exchange makes this possible. Here we present an overview of six different ways in which HIE can improve patient safety—improved medication <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved laboratory <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved radiology <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved communication among providers, improved communication between patients and providers, and improved public health <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> Within the area of improved medication <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> we discuss drug-allergy <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug–dose <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug–drug <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug-diagnosis <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> and drug–gene <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> We also briefly discuss HIE and decreased patient safety as well as standards and completeness of information for HIE and patient safety...|$|R

According {{to the findings of}} our empirical study, reduction of the demand uncertainty generally can improve the B 2 B system performances of cost saving, operational efficiency, satisfaction, and new business opportunity. Meanwhile, we also found that companies with low uncertainty on the factor of supply have better B 2 B system performances of turnover and market share than the ones with high uncertainty. However, the uncertainty factors of best-selling books, firm investment, and partner investment may not have significant impacts on the B 2 B system performances. From the perspective of <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities, enhancement of purchasing/sales/reconciliation functions is critical to the B 2 B systems if the performances of cost saving, turnover, and satisfaction are the most serious concerns of book publishing companies. On the other hand, the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities of procurement/ distribution and enquiries have no significant effects on the B 2 B system performances.
