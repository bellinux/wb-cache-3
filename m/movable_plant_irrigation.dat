A short - season Upland cotton (Gossvpium hirsutum L.), variety DPL 20, was planted on 19 April 1993 and 15 April 1994 at the Marana Agricultural Center on a Pima clay loam (Typic Torrifluvent) soil. Treatments, designated Tl, 72, and T 3, were such that the initial post <b>plant</b> <b>irrigation</b> would be applied when the midday LWP of the uppermost, fully- developed leaf exposed to full sunlight measured - 15, - 19, and - 23 bars, respectively. All treatments received the same irrigation regime following the initial post <b>plant</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Basic <b>plant</b> measurements, including plant height, mainstem node number, fruit retention, number of nodes above the uppermost white bloom, fresh bloom count within a 166 -ft 1 area, and percent canopy cover, were taken weekly from each plot.

40|$|Presumably, from a {{physiological}} standpoint, early season water stress {{should be avoided}} to ensure early fruit initiation, good fruit retention, and optimum yield potential of cotton (Gossypium spp.). This {{study was conducted to}} determine the optimum timing of the initial post <b>plant</b> <b>irrigation</b> and the long term effect of postponement on subsequent plant growth patterns, fruit retention, and yield. A short - season Upland variety, (G. hirsutum L.), DPL 20, was planted on 19 April in Marana, AZ, elevation 1970 ft., on a Pima clay loam (Typic Torrifluvent) soil. Plots (experimental units) consisted of eight 40 in. rows and extended the full length of the irrigation run (600 ft.). Experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Initial post - <b>plant</b> <b>irrigations,</b> designated T 1, 72, and T 3, were applied when the midday leaf water potential (ψ) of the uppermost, fully- developed leaf reached - 15, - 19, and - 23 bars, respectively. All treatments received the same irrigation regime following the initial post <b>plant</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Basic <b>plant</b> measurements were taken weekly from each experimental unit. These included plant height, number of mainstem nodes, location of first fruiting branch, fruit retention, number of nodes above the uppermost white bloom, bloom count within a 166 ft² area, and percent canopy cover. Soil -water data at seven 25 cm depth increments was collected from a total of 36 access tubes located within the field study, with three tubes per plot. Lint yields (lb. lint /acre) were 1112, 1095, and 977 for T 1, 72, and T 3, respectively. Yields were significantly lower when the initial post <b>plant</b> <b>irrigation</b> was applied after ψ, dropped below - 19 bars, confirming the results of a previous study conducted in 1992. Throughout the growing season, height - node ratios (HNR) of T 1 and 72 plants were at or above the upper threshold established for DPL 20, while T 3 HNR remained close to the expected baseline. Fruit retention was low for all three treatments due to season -long insect pressure from lygus bug. The low fruit retention data reflects the effects of high HNR. Future work will include efforts to separate changes in ψ due to day-to-day climatic variations from those caused by soil -water depletion. A second objective will be to incorporate the data obtained from the neutron moisture meter probe into the study results in an effort to better describe the complete soil-plant-atmosphere continuum as affected by the various treatment regimes employed in this study...|$|R

The times of first post <b>planting</b> <b>irrigation</b> in a separate experiment were 20, 30 and 40 days from <b>planting</b> <b>irrigation</b> time in both seasons 2004 and 2005. A completely randomized block design with four replicate was used for each time of first irrigation. Each experiment of the first irrigation included ten of fertilizers treatments. Application the first irrigation after 40 days from planting resulted in the highest values of all growth characters. However, application of the first irrigation after 30 days from planting gave the highest values of all yield and yield components, except boll weight which recorded highest values with application the first irrigation after 20 days from planting. On the other hand, the lowest values of all growth, yield and yield components were recorded by application of the first irrigation after 20 days from planting in the two seasons, except boll weight which recorded the lowest values with application the first irrigation after 30 days from planting in the two seasons. Application the first irrigation after 40 days from planting gave the highest values of fiber strength and fiber length uniformity ratio (%). On the other hand, the lowest values of fiber strength and fiber uniformity ratio (%) were recorded by application the first irrigation after 20 days from planting over the two seasons. Maximum means of all studied characters were produced from fertilizing cotton plants with organic fertilizer + bio-fertilizer + 66 % from recommended NPK in both seasons. On the contrary, the lowest values were obtained from plots received Bio-fertilizer alone, except fiber quality which the lowest values were obtained from plots received organic fertilizer alone.
