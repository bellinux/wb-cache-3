Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, the First Gulf War, and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. He is also outspoken on civil liberties and civil rights, criticizing racial discrimination {{in the criminal justice system}} as well as advocating for privacy rights against mass surveillance policies such as the USA Patriot Act and the NSA surveillance programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first debate}} between Linda McMahon and Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 Senate race {{occurred}} on October 4, 2010, moderated by Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier and televised live on Fox Connecticut. In the debate, McMahon identified Blumenthal {{as a career}} politician, touted her job creation record while CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, criticized Washington partisanship for Republicans not being invited {{to the negotiating table}} during healthcare reform discussions in Congress, and stated that remaining stimulus dollars were a waste that should now be used to pay down debt. Blumenthal as well criticized partisanship, saying that he would have sided with Republicans who voted against the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He also used the debate to argue that <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>tax</b> cuts should not have to wait for current tax rates on top income earners to be extended, stated that he would oppose special interests in Washington, and criticized McMahon for outsourcing WWE products overseas.|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, with a {{temporary}} payroll tax cut set to expire {{at the end}} of the month, the Senate considered the <b>Middle</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Tax</b> Cut Act of 2011, which would extend the tax cut for 113 million workers or families and fund the plan by a 3.25 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. [...] Brown voted against proceeding to take up the bill (i.e., voted against cloture that would end the filibuster). [...] He announced that his opposition was to the surtax on high incomes.|$|E
500|$|The tax cut {{extension}} for {{the remainder}} of the year was passed as the <b>Middle</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Tax</b> Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 on February 17, 2012, by a vote of 293–132 in the House and 60–36 in the Senate. [...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of the tax cut was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs. [...] Republican support for the bill was motivated by a desire to not oppose a tax cut in an election year. [...] Some Democrats criticized the bill for directing spending cuts at federal employees rather than generating funds by increasing taxes on the wealthy or closing tax loopholes.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2011, the Senate passed {{legislation}} {{to extend the}} Social Security payroll tax cut which had been previously enacted during the FY2011 budget negotiations. [...] That legislation had reduced the rate from 6.2% to 4.2% for the 2011 calendar year only. [...] The initial 2012 extension was for two months, rather than the full-year extension which had been sought; the legislation also extended unemployment benefits {{as well as a}} measure preventing a drop in rates for Medicare reimbursement; the spending for these was offset by enacting new fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [...] Points of contention included a Democratic plan to fund the tax cut with a new surtax on income over $1 million, which was dropped in later stages of negotiation, as well as attempts by Republicans to insert language which would speed the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which had recently been delayed by the Obama administration. [...] The bill was initially rejected in the House, whose leaders insisted on a full-year extension, {{despite the fact that the}} Senate had already adjourned for the year. [...] However, after criticism from other Republicans that the impasse would harm their prospects in the upcoming 2012 elections, the House leadership on December 23, 2011 announced that it would pass the Senate bill in return for Democrats promptly beginning negotiations on a full-year extension. [...] The bill, the <b>Middle</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Tax</b> Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011, was passed by the House and signed by the President later that day.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies optimal dynamic {{tax policy}} under {{the threat of}} {{political}} reform. A policy will be reformed ex post if a large enough coalition of citizens supports reform; thus, sustainable policies are those {{that will continue to}} attract enough political support in the future. We find that optimal marginal capital taxes are either progressive or U-shaped, so that savings are subsidized for the poor and/or the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> but are <b>taxed</b> for the rich.

40|$|Politicians across Canada’s {{political}} spectrum strive to position themselves as {{defenders of the}} <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> and <b>tax</b> policy is a prime vehicle for making this pitch. Any tax reform proposal can be examined critically to evaluate its likely distributional impacts and how well these map onto specific definitions of the <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> This article attempts, however, a different project. Drawing on the ideas of Judith Butler, it analyzes instead how tax policy produces middle-class identity through the very process of claiming to advance middle-class interests. The case study for this purpose is the rise of tax incentives for saving as a prominent feature of Canadian personal tax policy over the two decades from 1995 to 2015, culminating {{in the debate over}} the Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA) in the 2015 federal election campaign. I suggest that the presentation, design, and language of these registered savings plans have shaped the content of middle-class identity, including the behaviors, expectations, and aspirations that condition membership in this identity group. Looking at this performative quality of tax policy helps to explain the remarkable surge and continued salience of savings tax incentives as a governmental response to economic insecurity and precarity, {{even in the face of}} mounting evidence that they are ineffective or inadequate solutions to these problems...|$|R
5000|$|On May 9, 2016, Trump said on Meet the Press: [...] "The thing I'm {{going to}} do is make sure the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> gets good <b>tax</b> breaks. For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And you know what, it really should go up." [...] The {{following}} day, Trump backtracked on his comment on taxation of the wealthy, [...] "saying he had been referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal" [...] and did not support an increase in taxes of the wealthy from current levels. Trump's has frequently throughout his presidential campaign changed his view as to whether the wealthy should see tax cuts or increases.|$|R
500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>tax</b> cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E
2500|$|Bannon has {{advocated}} {{reductions in}} immigration, and restrictions on free trade, particularly with China and Mexico.

He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as [...] "the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan". Bannon is opposed to government bailouts, describing them as [...] "socialism for the very wealthy". He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the [...] "deconstruction of the administrative state". However, he does support increased regulation of internet companies like Facebook and Google, which he regards as akin to utilities in the modern age. He opposed the merger between Time-Warner and AT on antitrust grounds. He was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement within the administration, successfully persuading the President to withdraw from it.|$|E

5000|$|Frank {{suggests}} that a progressive income tax or a progressive consumption tax could remedy the dilemma posed by positional externalities. [...] By increasing the progressivity of the current tax structure, the wealthy would pay {{a larger share of}} taxes. Simultaneously, the poor and <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> would pay <b>taxes</b> that would be more equitable to their income. A result would be an equal playing field for all the classes. Frank uses the housing market as an example. He states that people at the top should save their earnings and spend less on housing. In turn, their savings would alter the context that influences housing expenditures of people directly below top earners. This would result in a reverse expenditure cascade that would encourage higher savings.|$|R
