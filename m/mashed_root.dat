40|$|Wireworms, the belowground larvae of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), {{represent}} a threat for various crops, including cereals, potatoes and small fruits, in many countries. In {{order to promote}} the development of bio-pesticides or the selection of resistant varieties, studies concerning the close relationship between wireworms and the roots they attack have to be conducted. Indeed, lacks of knowledge in the chemical ecology of these small but consequent pests baffle such achievements. Here, we studied the reactions of wireworms (Agriotes sordidus Illiger) facing root-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of barley. We first tested the ability of wireworms to orientate towards a blend of volatile compounds emitted by seven day’s old <b>mashed</b> <b>roots</b> of barley grown in vermiculite. We used a Y-shaped horizontal olfactometre, which inferior half was filled with compressed and humidified vermiculite. Wireworms were able to detect blends of volatiles emitted by <b>mashed</b> <b>roots,</b> and to orientate their foraging behaviour toward the emission source. Volatile compounds were identified from barley roots using SPME-GC-MS and several chemicals were identified. This study {{is part of a}} larger programme which purpose is the identification of VOCs emitted by the roots of barley and different actors of the rhizosphere, and to assess their semiochemical functions.

40|$|Research in Rwanda {{demonstrated}} that orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) purée (steamed, <b>mashed</b> <b>roots)</b> was an economically viable, vitamin A enhancing ingredient in baked products when the purée was produced {{and used in}} the same bakery. Having a storable, packaged OFSP purée produced by a firm to supply bakers is an alternative model. Vacuum-packed OFSP purée with preservatives with a four-month shelf-life at 23 °C was developed by the International Potato Center under laboratory conditions in 2015. Turning it into a commercial reality required developing a public-private partnership to establish an OFSP purée-bread value chain. The phases in developing the chain are described. Cost-benefit assessment focuses on two points along the chain: the farmers producing roots for the purée factory and purée production. The first OFSP bread began to be marketed in six Tuskys’ stores in June 2015 at a premium price (5 Ksh above its regular bread), reaching 20 stores by August 2016. OFSP bread was well-received by consumers. Purée production became profitable (18 % profit margin) when we shifted from using peeled to unpeeled roots [...] the new product being a “high fiber” purée. Commercial OFSP purée production has been improved and is poised for profitable, larger-scale output...|$|R
5000|$|In the Hawaiian {{staple food}} called poi, the {{traditional}} ingredient of <b>mashed</b> taro <b>root</b> {{can be replaced}} by, or augmented with, mashed breadfruit. The resulting [...] "breadfruit poi" [...] is called poi ulu. Breadfruit {{is also found in}} Indonesia and Malaysia, where it is called sukun. In Indonesia, fried breadfruit is easily found being sold by street food vendors, and is known as gorengan. In the South Indian state of Kerala and coastal Karnataka, especially near Mangalore, where it is widely grown and cooked, it is known as kada chakka, seema chakka, jee kujje, or dee gujje.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name was}} {{originally}} {{an acronym for}} [...] "Poor Obfuscation Implementation", referring humorously {{to the fact that}} the file formats seemed to be deliberately obfuscated, but poorly, since they were successfully reverse-engineered. This explanation - and those of the similar names for the various sub-projects - were removed from the official web pages in order to better market the tools to businesses who would not consider such humor appropriate. The original authors (Andrew C. Oliver and Marc Johnson) also noted the existence of the Hawaiian poi dish, made of <b>mashed</b> taro <b>root,</b> which had similarly derogatory connotations.|$|R

The Moapa Paiute boiled the leaves in a quantity of water and {{used it as a}} bath for muscular pains and for sore feet. The Shoshone <b>mashed</b> the <b>roots</b> and boiled them to make a poultice for swellings, or the decoctions used as an antiseptic wash. A tea from the boiled roots can be taken for stomachache or more commonly as a tonic for general debility following colds. The Pima in the Southwest made an infusion of dried roots which was taken for colds. They also chewed the roots and swallowed them or made a decoction of the roots which was taken for coughs.

50|$|In Sweden and Norway, {{rutabaga}} {{is cooked}} with potato and sometimes carrot, and mashed {{with butter and}} either stock or, occasionally, milk or cream, to create a puree called rotmos (Swedish, literally: <b>root</b> <b>mash)</b> or kålrabistappe (Norwegian). Onion is occasionally added. In Norway, kålrabistappe is an obligatory accompaniment to many festive dishes, including smalahove, pinnekjøtt, raspeball and salted herring. In Sweden, rotmos is often eaten together with cured and boiled ham hock, accompanied by mustard. This classic Swedish dish is called fläsklägg med rotmos. In Wales, a similar mash produced using just potato and rutabaga is known as ponsh maip in the north east of the country, as mwtrin on the Llyn peninsula and as stwnsh rwden in other parts.|$|R

40|$|Genre: Personal narrative. Theme: Weaving. Yuliana Puine (born c. 1960 - 62). {{tells about}} how dyeing and weaving {{were done in}} the past, and as practised by her mother. She speaks at length {{about the process of}} indigo dyeing and how to achieve the black colour that is {{background}} colour on nearly all Palu'e sarongs. To be noted is that after the indigo dyeing, to achieve a resistent and shiny black colour, they boiled bark from the mangrove 'moro hae', dried 'langalidi leaves' and 'wuwu' fruit (or the seeds inside? She did not mention that, others did), until the water became red, and about half of the original volume. Then a baked and <b>mashed</b> 'loi' <b>root</b> fruit from the forest was mixed into the water. The water was poured into a 'kora', a split 'bethu' bamboo, and then the yarn was put into the fluid, and squeezed. Red thread could be treated with 'loi' as well (she did not say if the red 'Meja sera 'thread was immersed into the same water [...] it was also red so it seems possible. Take her literally, they just squeezed 'loi' into the red thread to increase its strength. Towards the end she mentions a few differences with today's weaving and yesterday's, two different tools, or differences within the same kind of tool. Recorded with the H 4 N Zoom by SD, 2 Nov - 16, before noon, in Yuliana's home, Matamere. No others present during recording, which is exceptional. Palu'e, Flores, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia.
