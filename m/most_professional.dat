5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. <b>Most</b> <b>professional</b> astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E

5|$|The dive {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by <b>most</b> <b>professional</b> divers, for whom it may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E
5|$|IABC hosts {{networking}} {{events and}} mentoring {{programs to help}} recent graduates connect with working public relations, marketing and corporate communications professionals. <b>Most</b> <b>professional</b> members join IABC to further their career advancement, professional development and to grow their professional network. IABC is no longer accepting new applicants for its Accredited Business Communicator (ABC) program, but a new certification program has been initiated that would involve computerized testing and renewals every three years.

50|$|Counselors {{are held}} to a higher {{standard}} that <b>most</b> <b>professionals</b> because of the intimacy of their therapeutic delivery. Counselors are not only to avoid fraternizing with their clients. They should avoid dual relationships, and never engage in sexual relationships.|$|R

5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that <b>most</b> <b>professional</b> hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Impact World Tag Team Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world tag team championship {{which is owned by}} the Impact Wrestling promotion. The current champions are Ohio Versus Everything, who are in their first reign both individually and as a team.

5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. <b>Most</b> <b>professional</b> clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other works}} {{from this time}} period, such as the K. 97 symphony, the autograph, {{which was in the}} {{possession}} of Breitkopf & Härtel, was destroyed during World War II. Mozart's authorship therefore remains uncertain. <b>Most</b> <b>professionals</b> consider the work authentic.|$|R
50|$|Shoring {{should not}} be {{confused}} with shielding by means of trench shields. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse, whilst shielding is only designed to protect workers should collapse occur. <b>Most</b> <b>professionals</b> agree that shoring is the safer approach of the two.|$|R
5|$|Both leagues {{employ the}} same two-series playoff format, {{with the top}} three teams from each league {{participating}} in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike <b>most</b> <b>professional</b> leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may end in a tie if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If a Climax Series game results in a tie, the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end in a tie, the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record. If both teams finished with the same regular season record, the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} lens for <b>most</b> <b>professionals</b> was the Nikkor 50 mm f/1.4, but some preferred the Nikkor 35 mm f/2 {{with a wider}} field of view for grab shots.

25|$|In April 2016, it was {{reported}} that Russell had written letters to all 32 NFL teams asking for a tryout and pledging to play one year for free, although no team responded to this letter. <b>Most</b> <b>professional</b> football experts believe that it is not likely any NFL team would take any interest in Russell, since he had not played a meaningful down in seven years.|$|E
25|$|Because of the Linn LM-1's versatility, it {{superseded}} {{its intended}} purpose as an accompaniment tool {{and became a}} fully-fledged rhythm section for many synthpop and progressive acts.

25|$|Under {{moderate}} usage, {{a pair of}} pointe shoes will typically last through ten {{to twenty}} hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use {{from a pair of}} pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. As a result, <b>most</b> <b>professional</b> ballet companies provide shoe allowances for their dancers to defray the cost of frequent shoe replacement.|$|E
25|$|In today's rodeos, men {{and women}} compete equally {{together}} only {{in the event of}} team roping, though technically women now could enter other open events. There also are all-women rodeos where women compete in bronc riding, bull riding and all other traditional rodeo events. However, in open rodeos, cowgirls primarily compete in the timed riding events such as barrel racing, and <b>most</b> <b>professional</b> rodeos do not offer as many women's events as men's events.|$|E
25|$|Their eating {{quality is}} very good. Their flesh {{is white and}} sweet when cooked, and has very little oil, making it similar in taste to snapper or grouper.

To help ensure this, Florida Wildlife and Game Commission officers strictly enforce bag limits for these fish.|$|E
