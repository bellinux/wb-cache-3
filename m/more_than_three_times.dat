The MQQ-SIG signature scheme has a public key consisting of n quadratic polynomials in n variables where 2 n = 160, 192, 224 or 256.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a robust method is {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} data consisting of repeated binary observations taken at up to <b>three</b> fixed <b>time</b> points on each subject. The primary objective is to compare outcomes at the last time point, using earlier observations to predict this for subjects with incomplete records. A score test is derived. The method is developed for application to sequential clinical trials, as at interim analyses there will be many incomplete records occurring in non-informative patterns. Motivation for the methodology comes from experience with clinical trials in stroke and head injury, and data from one such trial is used to illustrate the approach. Extensions to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> points and to allow for stratification are discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|Nine Atlantic hurricanes—Camille, Allen, Andrew, Isabel, Ivan, Dean, Felix, Irma and Maria—reached Category5 {{intensity}} on {{more than}} one occasion; that is, by reaching Category5 intensity, weakening to a Category4 or lower, and then becoming a Category5 again. Such hurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix, Irma, and Maria each attained Category 5 status twice during their lifespans. Allen, Isabel, and Ivan reached Category 5 intensity on three separate occasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category5 intensity <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a Category5 (although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat suspect).

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> {{the age of}} the universe of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|The film {{generated}} £7.1 {{million in}} its first weekend of release in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2007. In the 20 April US opening weekend, the film grossed $5.8 million from only 825 cinemas, making it the highest per-cinema average of any film in the top ten that week. Its opening weekend take beat the $3.3 million opening weekend gross of Pegg and Wright's previous film, Shaun of the Dead. In its second weekend of release, Rogue Pictures expanded the film's cinema count from 825 to 1,272 and it grossed $4.9 million, representing a 17% dip in the gross. Altogether, Hot Fuzz grossed $80,573,774 worldwide. In nine weeks, the film earned nearly twice what Shaun of the Dead made in the US, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> its gross in other countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} cost {{reduction}} requires using less raw material and cost-effective processes without sacrificing the conversion efficiency. For keeping high the generated photo-current, an advanced light trapping scheme for ultra-thin silicon wafers is here proposed, exhibiting absorptances up to 99 % of 4 n 2 classical absorption limit for wafer thinner than 35 ?m. Such excellent optical performance {{does not reflect}} optimal electronic properties due to high recombination rate of the nano-textured surface. Therefore, we propose a passivation method involving both wet etching and high quality passivation coating of the nano-textured surface. For wet etching time longer than 30 s recombination rate of the nano-textured surface reduced <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> {{with respect to the}} un-etched one while keeping the averaged reflectance below 2 % (between 300 and 1050 nm).

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the rate of those in the wild.

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
