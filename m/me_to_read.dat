500|$|Al Williamson {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York City, New York, one of two {{children}} of Sally and Alfonso Williamson, who was of Scottish descent and a Colombian citizen. The family relocated to Bogotá, Colombia, when Al was two years old. [...] "My father was Colombian {{and my mother was}} American," [...] Williamson said in 1997. [...] "They met in the States, got married and went down there. I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. It was comic books that taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> both languages." [...] At age nine, Williamson took an interest in comic strips via the Mexican magazine Paquin, which featured American strips as well as Underwater Empire by Argentine cartoonist Carlos Clemen. Later, Williamson was attracted to Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon strip after his mother took him to see the Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe movie serial. While living in Bogotá he met future cartoonist Adolfo Buylla, who befriended him and gave him artistic advice. At age 12, in 1943, Williamson moved with his mother to San Francisco, California; they later moved to New York.|$|E
500|$|Alfred {{finally gave}} in to Edward's wishes and paid for {{university}} classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, {{one of the most}} influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in both German and French, [...] "not so much for their own sake," [...] wrote Edward, [...] "but as for their value in enabling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> their books of a literary or scientific character." [...] During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy's urging. Cope's job lasted two years and he visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society.|$|E

Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors. Corey Mandell, a screenwriter who had previously worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, signed on to write the script for the film, which had previously gone through 10 revisions. Mandell stated in an interview, [...] "I am not a Scientologist… I came on board because John asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the book and said, 'It's not a religious book. It's a science-fiction story. There's nothing sacred about the story, nothing of the religious philosophy.

500|$|Prior to {{her first}} release with Virgin, Jackson was asked by Jam and Lewis to record a song for the sound track to the feature film Mo' Money, {{released}} in 1992 by their label Perspective Records. Jon Bream of the Star Tribune reported: [...] "For most movie soundtracks, producers negotiate with record companies, managers and lawyers for the services of big-name singers. Like the Hollywood outsiders that they are, Edina-based Jam and Lewis went directly to such stars as Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Bell Biv Devoe, Color Me Badd and Johnny Gill." [...] Jackson, Jackson and Vandross recorded the duet or trio [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free", which peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R Singles chart. Shortly afterward, Jackson began filming for her first feature length role in John Singleton's Poetic Justice. Although she was encouraged by a major studio executive {{to take on a}} film in which she could portray a singer, she insisted on finding a different role. She explained: [...] "About that same time John Singleton asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his new script. John and I became buddies—I loved Boyz N the Hood—so I thought he was just asking my advice. I was shocked and honored to learn the screenplay had been written with me in mind. 'Would you play Justice?' he wanted to know. Yes! I'd finally found a role—a dramatic nonsinging role—that was right." [...] Released in July 1993, Poetic Justice debuted at number one at the box office, grossing $11,728,455; it grossed a grand total of $27,515,786.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have always}} {{regarded}} Paine {{as one of}} the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic ... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine's works in my boyhood ... it was, indeed, a revelation to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> that great thinker's views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine's writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, 'What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!' My interest in Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and again, just as I have done since my boyhood days.|$|E

In his writing and in his news reporting, Russert spoke openly and fondly of his Catholic school {{education}} and {{of the role of the}} Catholic Church in his life. He was an outspoken supporter of Catholic education on all levels. Russert said that his father, a sanitation worker who never finished high school, [...] "worked two jobs all his life so his four kids could go to Catholic school, and those schools changed my life." [...] He also spoke warmly of the Catholic nuns who taught him. [...] "Sister Mary Lucille founded a school newspaper and appointed me editor and changed my life," [...] he said.

2500|$|Oscott also {{produced}} writers whose {{relationship with their}} Catholic background was ambiguous or actively hostile, and who – often writing from exile – were to become leading figures of the decadent literature of {{the close of the}} 19th century. The Irish-born George Moore was provoked into becoming a writer by his seven years at Oscott, which he called [...] "a vile hole, a den of priests", turning to Byron and Shelley and noting that [...] "it pleased <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> 'Queen Mab' and 'Cain' amid the priests and ignorance of a hateful Roman Catholic college". His early novels – particularly his 1885 work A Mummer's Wife, which dealt with alcoholism and the seedy underside of theatrical life – [...] "opened up new possibilities for the novel in English", being the first to break away from the literary conventions of the Victorian style {{under the influence of the}} naturalism of Émile Zola. Moore constantly developed the form of his literary self-expression, with his later novels having a more fragmented, tapestry-like structure. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from Victorian to modern fiction, and a particular influence on James Joyce: the critic Graham Hough wrote that [...] "neither the title nor the content of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would have been quite the same in 1916 if it had not been for the prior existence of George Moore's Confessions of a Young Man in 1886." [...] "The Dead", the final story of Joyce's Dubliners, was directly inspired by Moore's 1891 novel Vain Fortune. The eccentric novelist and artist Frederick Rolfe studied at Oscott from 1887, but left after it was decided he was an unsuitable candidate for the priesthood. Despite his open homosexuality he strongly felt himself to have a vocation for the priesthood throughout his lifetime. His most famous work was the decadent semi-autobiographical wish-fulfilment novel Hadrian the Seventh, published under his self-styled title Baron Corvo, in which he imagined himself as the Pope, but he also wrote short stories, poetry and essays. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was inspired to become poet by the metaphysical teachings of Oscott's professor of philosophy during the 1850s, but embarked upon a succession of affairs during his subsequent career as a diplomat, becoming a self-confessed hedonist. He is best known for his erotic verse, and for his anti-imperialist opposition to British policy in Ireland, Egypt, Sudan and India. In 1914 a group of poets including W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, and Richard Aldington entertained Blunt to a lunch of roast peacock, paying tribute to him as the first poet to relate poetry to real life. Pound wrote of Blunt's [...] "unconquered flame", though Yeats was more ambivalent, confiding in T. Sturge Moore that [...] "only a small part of his work is good but that is exceedingly fine".|$|E
