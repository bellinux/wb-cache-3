40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{importance}} of forest edges in ecology, only one study has previously been carried out in New Zealand on the modification of climate across forest edges. We measured light exposure, wind speed, air and soil temperature, and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) perpendicular to a north-south aligned, mature, edge of native broadleaf rainforest adjoining grazed pasture. At a point 80 m into the forest from the edge, light was only c. 0. 7 % and wind speed c. 20 % {{of that in the}} open, and there was much less diurnal fluctuation in soil temperature, air temperature and VPD. The gradient of microclimate near the edge, as measured with a third (<b>mobile)</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station,</b> was abrupt for soil temperature and similar to the pattern of light exposure, with almost complete change over about 10 m. The gradient was less steep for wind speed, air temperature and VPD, with at least 40 m being required to stabilise these variables when wind was directed into the forest. These findings suggest that forest buffers of at least 40 m may be needed to protect forest reserves and streams from climatic exposure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the heat tolerance of five zebu breeds using physical, physiological and hematological traits as well as thermographic responses. Forty cows of the Gir, Girolando, Nelore, Sindhi and Indubrasil breeds (eight cows each), approximately three years of age, were evaluated. Body weight, withers and hump heights as well as thoracic circumference were recorded. The density and length of the hair was obtained by collecting one square centimeter in the rump region and skin color using the CIELAB system. Rectal temperature, heart and respiratory rates were evaluated during the morning at 4 : 30 h, and in the afternoon, at 14 : 30 h, with six repetitions. Blood samples were collected for hematological evaluation. The surface temperature was obtained using an infrared camera FLIR® T 400. Two images were taken from each animal, one laterally of the whole body and the other of the head region. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity were obtained from a <b>mobile</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station.</b> The statistics analysis included an analyzes of variance, principal factors, as well as cluster, discriminant and canonical analyzes, logistic regression and calculation of odds ratio. There were significant differences in the rectal temperature, heart and respiratory rates between breeds. Gir and Indubrasil breeds had the highest rectal temperatures. Breed was significant for surface temperatures and showed that physical and physiological factors affected breeds in different ways. Eye and brain surface temperatures were the most affected by environmental parameters. Also, environmental parameters affected packed cell volume and red cell number. Odds ratio test showed that the Gir breed was three times more likely to have higher rectal temperature compared with Sindhi as confirmed by the logistic regression. When the black globe temperature approached 35 °C, the probability of the Gir animals having rectal temperatures above normal was approximately 70 %. Gir was the breed least adapted to climate conditions of the experiment while the Sindhi and Girolando breeds showed the best physiological response to thermal stress...|$|E

40|$|Mountain snow-cover is {{normally}} heterogeneously distributed due to wind and precipitation {{interacting with the}} snow cover on various scales. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate snow deposition and wind-induced snow transport processes on different scales and to analyze some major drift events caused by North-West storms during two consecutive accumulation periods. In particular, we distinguish between the individual processes that cause specific drifts using a physically based model approach. Very high resolution wind fields (5 m) were therefore computed with the atmospheric model Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and used as input for a model of snow surface processes (Alpine 3 D) to calculate saltation, suspension and preferential deposition of precipitation. Several flow features during North-West storms were identified with input from a high-density network of permanent and <b>mobile</b> <b>weather</b> <b>stations</b> and indirect estimations of wind directions from snow surface structures, such as snow dunes and sastrugis. We also used Terrestrial and Airborne Laser Scanning measurements to investigate snow deposition patterns and to validate the model. The model results suggest that the in-slope deposition patterns we found, particularly two huge cross-slope cornice-like drifts, developed only when the prevailing wind direction was northwesterly and were formed mainly due to snow redistribution processes (saltation-driven). In contrast, more homogeneous deposition patterns on a ridge scale were formed during the same periods mainly due to preferential deposition of precipitation. The numerical analysis showed that snow-transport processes were sensitive to the changing topography due to the smoothing effect of the snow cover...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new method for {{determining}} the shading of surfaces by means of terrestrial laser scanner measurements and two specially designed computer programs, which, for any selected observation point, can determine the contour of the terrain, {{the position of the}} sun, and insolation over time. The method was applied to the Moste dam, where, after scanning of the area of the dam, the contours of the terrain were determined from ten observation points located along the axis of the dam's downstream surface, for azimuths of 80 ° to 280 ° at a selected horizontal angle and step of 5 °. In order to exclude stray points, quantiles of 0. 998 and 0. 997 were selected. The results of calculations made using the two applied variants were very similar, thus indicating a minuscule number of stray points. Very reliable results were already obtained when using the quantile of 0. 998. The results of the measurements and the calculations of shading at the Moste <b>mobile</b> automatic <b>weather</b> <b>station,</b> over a period of seven consecutive clear days in early August 2013, showed very good agreement, confirming that the described method for determining of shading is highly reliable...|$|R

Now we are moving wired to wireless network, that is mobile environment shown in fig 2 (any where any time and any thing computing), plays key role in this new century. In this application mobile GIS, which will be a network environment, is proposed, which can perform monitoring of emission levels at a city level or country level or Global level.
