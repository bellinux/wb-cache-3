40|$|Background or context Regret is {{a common}} {{consequence}} of decisions, including those decisions related to individuals’ health. Several assessment instruments have been developed that attempt to measure decision regret. However, recent research has highlighted the complexity of regret. Given its relevance to shared decision making, {{it is important to}} understand its conceptualization and the instruments used to measure it. Objectives To review current conceptions of regret. To systematically identify instruments used to measure decision regret and assess whether they capture recent conceptualizations of regret. Search strategy Five electronic databases were searched in 2008. Search strategies used a combination of MeSH terms (or database equivalent) and free text searching under the following key headings: ‘Decision’ and ‘regret’ and ‘measurement’. Follow-up manual searches were also performed. Inclusion criteria Articles were included if they reported the development <b>and</b> psychometric <b>testing</b> of an <b>instrument</b> designed to measure decision regret, or the use of a previously developed <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> <b>instrument.</b> Main results Thirty-two articles were included: 10 report the development and validation of an instrument that measures decision regret and 22 report the use of a previously developed <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> <b>instrument.</b> Content analysis found that existing instruments for the measurement of regret do not capture current conceptualizations of regret and they do not enable the construct of regret to be measured comprehensively. Conclusions Existing instrumentation requires further development. There is also a need to clarify the purpose for using regret assessment instruments as this will, and should, focus their future application...|$|R

30|$|To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of economic competencies, both modelling and measuring will be discussed. Historically, the origin of modelling and measuring economic competencies can be observed in the US in the report “Economic Education in School” (Committee for Economic Development 1961). Subsequently, a large number of different definitions <b>and</b> (<b>test)</b> <b>instruments</b> have followed to explain and measure economic competencies. Definitions then changed from a more rudimentary and instrumental understanding of the basic content (e.g., how to foot a bill?) towards a more basic economical understanding, which includes a basal understanding of marketing principles, economic systems, shortage of goods, factors of production, incentive systems, economical trade-offs, and other factors (Soper and Walstad 1987; see Kotte and Witt 1995).|$|R
40|$|We have {{addressed}} the problem of threshold voltage (VTH) variation in Flash memory cells after heavy ion irradiation by using specially designed array structures <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>instruments.</b> After irradiation, low VTH tails appear in VTH distributions, growing with ion LET and fluence. In particular, high LET ions, such as Iodine used in this work, can produce a bit flip. Since the existing models cannot account for large charge losses from the Floating Gate, we propose a new mechanism, based on the excess of positive charge produced by a single ion, temporarily lowering the tunnel oxide barrier (Positive charge Assisted Leakage Current, PALC) and enhancing the tunneling current. This mechanism fully explains experimental data we presen...|$|R

Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems, to allow optimal control of emissions over widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.|$|R
