Radio Five Live then hired Boycott in early 2004. His fellow commentators state that his illness has altered his voice {{and led to a}} more pleasant personality, but that he is still prone to unpleasant behaviour. Channel Four producer Gary Francis stated [...] "I think Geoff is a lot more mellow now.

Futterman described the performance as [...] "rife with emotion" [...] and added, [...] "It's <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> this that are pure and straight to the show's original appeal", while Strecker complimented the song choice and how [...] "it really showcased the group's harmonies". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee best performances.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} this episode [...] "turned {{out to be}} an {{absolute}} winner". He concluded that [...] "with its more relatable storylines and <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> the eerie-voiced guy at the hospital, Liz tipping tables for her mac and cheese, and watching an entire sandwich be eaten in real time in the airport security line, 'Sandwich Day' was a definite highlight in the post-writers' strike season." [...] Erin Fox of TV Guide said that [...] "the minor story of the episode was probably the funniest". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that this episode [...] "was nothing more than...eh". He called this episode a [...] "weak link".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contains}} a live-action segment featuring characters {{from the show}} as puppets and a guest appearance from singer Katy Perry as herself. It parodies the two television series The Muppet Show and Sesame Street, both of which feature the puppet characters The Muppets. References to those shows include puppet versions of Grampa and Jasper heckling the cast of the Simpsons puppet show from a box seat {{in the manner of}} Statler and Waldorf from The Muppet Show, and Moe devouring cookies like Cookie Monster does on Sesame Street. Brad Trechak of AOL TV noted that [...] "the plot of the segment was silly and simplistic in line with the style of Sesame Street but had some real adult <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> one would see on The Muppet Show." ...|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said the}} new paper company {{continued}} {{to serve as a}} good change for the series, and the Michael and Dwight rivalry was a [...] "fun development, and it feels as though the writers are taking great advantage of the [...] ". Steve Mullen praised the episode not only for the Michael/Dwight war, but also for smaller <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> the cheese puff tosses and the messages Pam and Ryan wrote on a clipboard for Michael during his phone call; Mullen said, [...] "I'm not sure any other 30 minute comedy currently on TV can even touch The Office." [...] Amy Stetts of The Express-Times said the Michael Scott Paper Company plot [...] "peaked" [...] with this episode, and she genuinely could not predict how the storyline would end.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, but I see glimmers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweetums" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{called it}} a [...] "fantastic episode", and called the world of Parks and Recreation rich, lively and [...] "a beautiful mosaic". Fowler praised individual comedic <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> the DJ Roomba jokes and portrayal of the easily [...] fooled Pawnee citizens, {{as well as the}} development of storylines like that of Tom and Wendy, and Andy and April. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the episode for revealing more about the mythology of the town of Pawnee, such as the strong influence Sweetums holds over the residents, and the ongoing feud between the parks department and the library. He also praised the character development of characters like Tom and April, adding, [...] "It's amazing to me how in such a short time, Parks & Rec has taken the most one-note characters and made them truly three-dimensional." ...|$|E
500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{called the}} episode a solid episode {{and said that}} the {{introduction}} of Homer's brother [...] "could have been gimmicky, especially with a big-name guest star like DeVito, but the concept fared nicely." [...] Jacobson added that he thought DeVito [...] "brought spark to his part and made Herb fun and lively. The parts in which Homer developed his car were also hilarious and offered some of the show’s best bits. The program even showed some great little <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> the hallmark Simpson five o'clock shadow on infant Herb." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said the episode [...] "features another great guest voice, this time by Danny DeVito as the voice of Homer's long lost brother Herb, who reenters Homer's life and solicits his 'common man' prospective in building a car. Once again, Homer's sentimentality comes through." [...] Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked DeVito's performance as the 10th best guest appearance in the show's history.|$|E

Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow". Kreisberg {{revealed that}} the writers' rooms for both shows were merged while working on the scripts for the episodes, similar to [...] "throwing two casts together".|$|E
500|$|... "W.T.F." [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said the}} professional wrestling parody was [...] "pretty spot on", {{but that the}} target was too easy, and the episode [...] "lacks {{a lot of the}} punchy kind of comedy that the show is usually known for". Nevertheless, Isler said the writing was clever [...] and had funny <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> Kenny's [...] "El Pollo Loco" [...] character, and the scene where the gym teacher tries to take down a security guard with a traditional wrestling move. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ grade and called it [...] "one of those too-common SP episodes that could've been cut in half". Modell said the true-to-life way the boys formed their wrestling company was [...] "great" [...] and that the parody of professional wrestling as on target, but also said they [...] "have been told a million times before. They're not really jokes at this point." ...|$|E
500|$|Philpot {{continued}} that <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> Will and {{his boss}} making out recalled the show's [...] "glory days", and Messing's trouble keeping {{a straight face}} [...] "brought back fond memories of Tim Conway cracking up Harvey Korman on The Carol Burnett Show." [...] Knoxville News Sentinels writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of The Carol Burnett Show because of its [...] "goofiness and by-the-seat-of-its-pants style." [...] Morrow added that the episode made him laugh {{more than any other}} sitcom on network television. Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] helped [...] "jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons" [...] and [...] "It's fun [...] to see the actors momentarily break character, a la The Carol Burnett Show, where the absurdity of certain situations (usually involving Jack and/or Karen) makes giggling all but impossible." [...] Entertainment Weekly television critic Gary Susman gave [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] four stars, while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a [...] "fun, and attention-grabbing, note."

500|$|... "Prince Family Paper" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Travis Fickett of IGN {{called it}} one of the show's better Michael-and-Dwight centric episodes, and called the chase between them [...] "a classic scene and perfectly executed". Fickett also praised several character <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> Kelly's breakdown over whether Hilary Swank is hot, but said the Swank subplot was less interesting than the main story. Brian Howard of The Journal News said he appreciated that the script had Michael follow through on betraying the Princes, rather than deciding to spare them, because he felt it was more realistic. Howard said, [...] "They didn’t let Michael off the hook. Instead the writers took a dark and dirty turn toward the truly tragic, in the literal sense of the word." [...] He also praised the Hilary Swank subplot as funny and a realistic conversation topic among officemates, although he admitted it was [...] "relegated to almost buffer status" [...] to the main plot. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said Michael's conflicted feelings about betraying the Prince family came up too late and resolved too abruptly to work well, and that the chase between Michael and Dwight was a poorly constructed [...] "misfire". However, he called the subplot about Hilary Swank [...] "genius with a capital G".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} pilot were generally positive. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the pilot {{eight out of}} ten. Goldman admitted that while he [...] "never had any interest in the many stories of forensics investigators and the various bodily fluids they can use to solve crimes," [...] he found [...] "new series engaging and fun." [...] Goldman particularly praised Caan's performance in the episode, stating he [...] "is very good, bringing a lot of humor to the part and finding an easy chemistry with O'Loughlin. Per usual {{for this type of}} story, McGarrett and Danny don't get along initially and Caan is able to add a lot of charm to small <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> Danny saying to himself, 'I hate him. I hate him so much.'" [...] However, the reviewer also enjoyed the main cast in general, stating they were a [...] "very well cast and likable bunch and make this an easily accessible series. They're a group you want to spend more time with." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk stated [...] "The refreshing thing about Five-0 (revisited) is that while it has been given a brisk 21st-century spring clean, with international terrorism, people-smuggling and a blast of ultra-modern spook technology, its uncomplicated heart still belongs to the 1970s." [...] Sweeting added that [...] "the good guys (and girl) are clearly identified," [...] and [...] "the baddies are unambiguously despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness on the elevator, and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had lots of good throw-away <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best thing to happen to the show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was curious to see how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E

500|$|Kim {{was working}} as an intern at Seoul University Medical Clinic when the Korean War broke out. He went to Pusan on June 1, 1951, the day the North Korean army retreated. In Pusan, Kim met Oh Young-jin, a fellow Pyongyang National High School graduate. Oh, who would later write the {{screenplay}} to the popular film The Wedding Day (1956), was producing newsreels for the Korean News through the Bureau of Public Information, and helped Kim get a job writing screenplays with this organization. With Oh's help, Kim {{was able to get}} a job working for the United States Information Service in Jinhae. The job helped shape Kim's life in several ways. With the increase in pay he received from the U.S.I.S., he was able to marry Kim Yu-bong in 1951, and their first son, Kim Dong-won, was born in 1952. They would have a daughter born in 1955 and a second son, Kim Dong-yang, born in 1958. The two remained married {{for the rest of their}} lives. Kim Yu-bong supported her husband's filmmaking career through her dental practice, giving him a unique degree of independence among Korean filmmakers of his era to pursue his own personal visions. At a career retrospective during the last year of his life, Kim commented, [...] "My wife's support has been unflagging over the years, even if, at times, she has seen one of my films and cried 'What have you done with my money?' But at rare <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> this retrospective, she becomes very emotional, recognizing that finally it has all been worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was [...] "good but not great", despite [...] "more {{than a few}} strong <b>moments,</b> <b>like</b> the hilarious shot of Bart at the gay rights parade." [...] He added that [...] "most years {{this would be an}} A-list program, but it’s one of season five’s lesser lights despite a generally high level of quality." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described the episode as [...] "Lisa at her crusading best, Homer at his stupidest and Abe getting all the best lines again, especially at Krusty Burgers. Kathleen Turner's spot as the real Malibu Stacy is superb." [...] Janica Lockhart of The Easterner called the episode a [...] "classic" [...] and added: [...] "The episode takes on misogynist views, but in a humorous way, that only The Simpsons can master." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and DVD Talk's Bill Gibron gave it a score of 5 out of 5. The episode is one of Oakley and Weinstein's favorites from their time as writers on the show. One of Mirkin's favorite jokes on the show is the scene in this episode where Abe cycles down the street, shouting [...] "Look at me, I'm acting young!" [...] before Lisa's Malibu Stacy doll catches the front wheel of the bike, sending Abe flying into an open grave.|$|E
500|$|First he {{does not}} tell the story himself, but has one of his in-story characters, Orpheus, sing it; second, Ovid tells his {{audience}} not even to believe the story (cf. quote in [...] "Ovid's version"); third, he has Orpheus congratulate Rome, Ovid's home town, for its being {{far away from the}} land where this story took place (Cyprus). By distancing himself, Doll writes, Ovid lures his audience to keep listening. First then does Ovid begin telling the story describing Myrrha, her father and their relationship, which Doll compares to the mating of Cupid and Psyche: here the lovemaking occurs in complete darkness and only the initiator (Cupid) knows the identity of the other as well. Myrrha's metamorphosing into a tree is read by Doll as a metaphor where the tree incarnates the secret. As a side effect, Doll notes, the metamorphosis also alters the idea of incest into something natural for the imagination to think about. Commenting on a Freudian analysis of the myth stating that Ovid [...] "disconcertingly suggests that [...] might be an unspoken universal of human experience" [...] Doll notes that Ovid's stories work like metaphors: they are meant to give insight into the human psyche. Doll states that the moments when people experience <b>moments</b> <b>like</b> those of father-lust are repressed and unconscious, which means that they are a natural part of growing and that most grow out of it sometime. She concludes about Ovid and his version of Myrrha that: [...] "What is perverted, for Ovid, is the use of sex as a power tool and the blind acceptance of sexual male power as a cultural norm." ...|$|E
