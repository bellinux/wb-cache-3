40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the Judo and Basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after routine training were measured by the turbidity method (modified meulemans method) of members. The following results were obtained. 1) In members of the Basketball club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between noon and evening on the second day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening {{on the third day}} <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the fourth day. Significant increase in urinary protein-concentration corrected to a urine density of 1. 024 was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the second day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the third day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the fourth day.

Significant increase in protein-concentration corrected to a urine density of 1. 024 was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the second day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the fourth day. Significant increase in the excretion per minute of urinary protein was observed between noon and evening of the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the second day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the fourth day. 3) The existence of Pre (α 1) AG, (α 1) AT, (α 1) X, I(α) I, Zn(α 2), (β 2) AC, Myogl, C(3) act., Tf, (β 2) III, IgA, (β 2) I, Alb, and IgG of serum subfractions were recognized by immunodiffusion in an antigencontained gel layer. In particular, excretion of myoglobin was recognized. The experiments on optical density of the turbidity method of each fraction were discussed. 4) The main subjective symptoms (from questionnaires) which increased with physical loads were "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired" and "Wanting to lie down" in group I in the basketball club, and "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired", "Feel unsteady standing", "Becoming drowsy", "Wanting to lie down" in group I, "Feeling stiff in the shoulders", "Feeling thirsty" and "Tremor in limbs" in group III in the Judo club. 5) The preliminary care of fatigued members was discussed...|$|R

5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Piñero from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> in the laboratory during the afternoons.|$|E
5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only useful for the Red Wharf Bay branch, but a signalman was still required for all Amlwch services. In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out system that could turn the Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into one long section. This was of particular advantage in early <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E

5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian {{province}} of Massa and Carrara, {{located within the}} Tuscany region, it was a peasant food consumed as a one-course meal, topped with grated cheese and olive oil. In Massa and Carrara, it was sometimes accompanied with stracchino cheese or charcuterie. Testaroli remains a very popular dish in Pontremoli, a small city in the {{province of}} Massa and Carrara, where it is served at virtually every restaurant in the city, during both <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> evenings.

5|$|The trivia game begins, {{with various}} {{facts about the}} {{characters}} being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-to-nine score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in the <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.|$|E

5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early <b>mornings</b> <b>and</b> workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
