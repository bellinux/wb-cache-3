5000|$|A skysail is the {{uppermost}} sail in many old square-rigged sail-plans (though sometimes {{topped by a}} moonsail). It was also on the <b>royal</b> <b>mast</b> above the <b>royal</b> sail. It was typically used in light winds.|$|R
50|$|A moonraker, {{also known}} as a moonsail, hope-in-heaven, or hopesail, is a square sail flown {{immediately}} above a skysail (see sail-plan) on the <b>royal</b> <b>masts</b> of a square rigged sailing ship. None of the four- and five-masted square rigged ships carried a moonsail.|$|R

2500|$|Loch Vennachar {{was built}} in 1875 by Thomson's on the Clyde for the Glasgow Shipping Company. She {{was one of a}} fleet of iron wool {{clippers}} of the well-known Loch Line. Her registered tonnage and dimensions were: 1,552 tons gross, 1,485 tons net; length, 250 feet 1inch; breadth, 38 feet 3inches; depth of hold, 22 feet 4inches. [...] Her usual cargo was usually about 5,500 bales of wool. She was first rigged with fidded <b>royal</b> <b>masts,</b> but this proved to interfere with her stability as there was too much weight aloft. She was then given topgallant and <b>royal</b> <b>masts</b> in one with crossed royal yards over double-topgallants. Loch Vennachar was always in the wool trade to Adelaide and Melbourne, but when an out wool clipper, she also carried passengers and other cargo.|$|R
50|$|She is rigged {{with double}} topsails on the fore and main mast {{and a single}} topsail on the <b>mizzen.</b> She has <b>royals</b> on all <b>masts</b> and a skysail on the main mast.The {{building}} of the hull in 1997/98 {{was used as a}} work experience project for the unemployed (e.g. metalworking and welding). The ship was first presented to the public at the 2000 edition of SAIL Amsterdam. During the 2005, 2010 and 2015 editions of the event she was the flagship.|$|R
5000|$|Crosstrees {{are the two}} {{horizontal}} spars at {{the upper}} ends of the topmasts of sailing ships, used to anchor the [...] shrouds from the topgallant mast. Similarly, they may be mounted at {{the upper end of}} the topgallant to anchor the shrouds from the <b>royal</b> <b>mast</b> (if fitted). Similar transverse spars remain on steam ship and motor vessel masts to secure wire antennae or signal flag halyards.|$|R
50|$|Between 1703 and 1710 Matthis and mast {{selector}} Brinkkis {{were hired}} by the Tzar Peter I of Russia to select the wood {{for the construction of}} the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg, receiving the title of <b>Royal</b> <b>Mast</b> Selector. He engaged the Unitas Fratrum or Moravian Brethren, becoming one of their most prominent members in Riga, and this would have far lasting consequences in the destinies of his descendants. He had 10 known children all born in St John's parish in Riga.|$|R
5000|$|Original usage in 18th and 19th century square-rigged ships {{distinguished}} between the fore staysail, {{set on the}} forestay running from the foremast head to the ship's peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the jibs set on stays running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be [...] "set flying," [...] i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called jibs, set on stays running from the fore topmast to the bowsprit, or the fore topgallant mast to the jibboom or even the fore <b>royal</b> <b>mast</b> to the flying jibboom. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could {{have as many as}} six.|$|R
5000|$|... 's rig was {{designed}} according to traditional rules and is occasionally modified slightly with trainees in mind. The foremast is slightly {{shorter than the}} main mast, but they are otherwise identical. Each consists of a steel lower mast and topmast and timber topgallant and <b>royal</b> <b>mast.</b> Spars are steel on the lower and topmasts (course, lower topsail and upper topsail yards) and timber above this (topgallant and royal yards). Access to the tops is by a vertical [...] "jacob's ladder" [...] down to the ratlines, rather than inverted futtock shrouds. There is a gold sovereign placed under the foremast where it meets the keel, a tradition supposed to give the ship luck.|$|R
60|$|Having {{made this}} {{calculation}} {{as to the}} time I {{had to do it}} in, I set seriously about the job of making provisions with my raft. In one or two particulars, I could not much improve the latter; for, the yards lying underneath the masts, it rendered the last as buoyant as was desirable in moderate weather. It struck me, however, that by getting the top-gallant and <b>royal</b> <b>masts,</b> with their yards, in, around the top, I might rig a staging, with the aid of the hatches, that would not only keep me entirely out of water, in mild weather, but which would contain all one man could consume, in the way of victuals and drink, for a month to come. To this object, then, I next gave my attention.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which {{typically}} consisted of {{the trunk of a}} conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and <b>royal</b> <b>masts.</b> Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a made mast, as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as pole masts.|$|R
5000|$|When steel masts were introduced, {{with their}} lengths no longer {{limited by the}} height of a tree, ships were often {{constructed}} with single spars serving as both lower mast and topmast. In every other respect, however, the [...] "topmast" [...] lived on, with separate shrouds to the lower mast and a top between the two. The section of mast immediately above the top was often painted white as the lower masthead used to be, with the section of the steel mast representing the topmast continuing on above in its usual colour. Topgallant <b>masts</b> and <b>royal</b> <b>masts</b> were similarly combined, though, being shorter, they were often one spar even in the days of wood. A common arrangement on tall ships now in use is a steel spar as lower and topmast, surmounted by a wooden mast as topgallant and royal.|$|R
25|$|After {{a year in}} the war, the Van Buren {{anchored}} in Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 July 1842, where it reentered the Revenue Cutter Service. It was formally transferred back on 18 August 1842. The VanBuren operated out of the port of Charleston, South Carolina for three years, undergoing repairs once at Baltimore, Maryland from May through June 1844. Following the outbreak of the Mexicanâ€“American War in 1846, Robert J. Walker, Secretary of the Treasury, ordered the Van Buren to the Gulf of Mexico. Under the command of Captain Thomas C. Rudolph of the United States Revenue Marines, the vessel sailed with three months' worth of ammunition and supplies to report to the Customs Collector of the Port of New Orleans; however, {{on its way to the}} port, the lightning struck the <b>royal</b> <b>mast,</b> forcing the ship back to Charleston. On 2 June 1846, the ship set sail again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} the first sight of the whale myself,"-- he said. [...] "Aye! Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the {{mainmast}} head, he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end yet {{in his hand and}} standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck." [...] Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the <b>royal</b> <b>mast,</b> Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead astern, this side, and that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.|$|R
50|$|All three masts (with lower, top, and {{topgallant}} <b>masts</b> including <b>royal</b> and skysail <b>masts)</b> had {{a course}} sail, a topsail, a topgallant sail, a royal sail, and a skysail. The main-skysail mast has been lengthened and {{fitted with a}} moonsail later on. Her sail suit was made by Messrs. Porter, Mayhew & Co., Boston. Older pictures show the ship with only four square sails on the fore and mizzen masts, and five on the main mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{office of}} Surveyor General of the King's Woods had been {{regarded}} as a sinecure by most of its previous holders, but Wentworth took the job very seriously. The government had seen the forests of North America as an inexhaustible resource of timber {{for the construction of}} ships, buildings, wharves, and other purposes. But Wentworth was far-sighted enough to see that the pressure of human settlement was literally chipping away at the old-growth forests. In particular he was aware of the enormous demand by the <b>Royal</b> Navy for <b>mast</b> timber, the tall, straight pines that were suitable for masts, booms, and other rigging on sailing ships. And given that Britain had just lost about half of its forest lands in North America, he was determined that, for the defense of the realm, the remainder of the choice trees would be protected.|$|R
5000|$|Detlev LÃ¶ll and Hanns Temme {{purchased}} the ship at an auction and, {{with the help}} of some of the former crew, sailed the ship to Wolgast in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In spring 1992, a complete overhaul began, in the course of which the ship received a new exterior keel and was refitted as a brig; the rig includes five square sails at each mast and includes lifting yards for the upper-three yards (upper main topsail, topgallant and <b>royal)</b> at each <b>mast,</b> lowering the center of gravity of the ship when sails are furled. The overhaul was subsidized by the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Bundesagentur fÃ¼r Arbeit and formed part of the job creation program [...] "Fridtjof Nansen" [...] (led by the owner), which comprised the refitting of this ship as well as other sailing ships [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Schoharie, New York in 1770, the son of German immigrants; the family name was {{originally}} spelled Krausler or Kruessler. His father served in the British Army during the American Revolution under Sir John Johnson; the son was a drummer with Butler's Rangers. They both settled in Williamsburgh Township after the war. Crysler operated a tavern, cut timber to supply the <b>Royal</b> Navy with <b>masts</b> and built gristmills and sawmills. In 1804, {{he was elected to}} the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada representing Dundas. In 1806, he was appointed justice of the peace in the Eastern District. He served with the local militia during the War of 1812, becoming captain. The Battle of Crysler's Farm was fought on his property and his farm sustained heavy damage during the battle. He represented Dundas in the Legislative Assembly from 1812 to 1820 and from 1825 to 1828. In 1825, some of his employees were jailed for cutting timber on clergy reserves. He became lieutenant-colonel in the local militia in 1838 and led his regiment into combat at the Battle of the Windmill.|$|R
