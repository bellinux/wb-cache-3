Voltage fluctuations and power failures {{are two of}} the most concerning factors affecting the production.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. High grade ores {{have largely}} been {{depleted}} and those currently being treated are low grade, complex and sometimes finely disseminated, requiring fine grinding to liberate valuable minerals. For fine grinding applications, conventional tumbling mills are energy intensive. More energy efficient technologies such as stirred mills have been developed and widely used for fine and ultra-fine grinding. In this study, the effects of residence time, solids concentration, impeller speed, impeller type, media size and media density on energy consumption in a batch vertical stirred mill were investigated. The effect of energy on mill performance was assessed using the perfect <b>mixing</b> <b>mill</b> model. In addition, the effect of media stress intensity on grind and energy efficiency at constant residence time was also investigated. It was found that irrespective of the method of altering the energy input, the fineness of grind improved with increase in the specific energy input. This suggests that energy is the key driver for size reduction. The perfect mixing model {{can be used to}} assess mill performance and the breakage rates generally increased with increase in the specific energy input, impeller speed and solids concentration. The media stress intensity approach is useful in assessing mill performance in stirred mills at constant residence time. The fineness of grind improved when the media stress intensity was varied from 4. 41 × 10 - 3 to 27. 41 × 10 - 3 Nm. In addition, the specific energy required to produce material below 25 μm and 38 μm decreased with an increase in the media stress intensity. When slurry density effects were considered, an optimum stress intensity was observed with respect to specific energy required to produce material below 25 μm and 38 μm. It was recommended that additional test work be carried out to investigate the effect of media size in the range - 6. 7 mm + 2 mm on energy efficiency. It was also recommended that tests be carried out at impeller speed between 600 rpm and 1500 rpm to assess how mill performance increases even at relatively high impeller speeds.

A influência do tipo e teor do plastificante, do comprimento e do teor das fibras nas propriedades dos compósitos obtidos foi estudada. Dois tipos de plastificantes foram usados, um líquido (do tipo poliéster) e um sólido permanente (copolímero etileno/ acetato de vinila/ monóxido de carbono). As fibras usadas foram previamente lavadas com água a 80 °C por uma hora. Os compósitos, com fibras curtas aleatoriamente distribuídas, foram caracterizados através de ensaio mecânico de resistência à tração, microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), e análises térmicas de calorimetria exploratória diferencial (DSC) e análise por termogravimetria (TG). O comprimento ótimo de fibra obtido para os compósitos foi de 6 mm. O uso do plastificante sólido mostrou-se viável e promoveu uma maior molhabilidade da fibra pela matriz nos compósitos, principalmente para teores acima de 40 pcr. As análises térmicas mostraram que a substituição do plastificante líquido pelo plastificante sólido não afetou a estabilidade térmica das matrizes e dos compósitos.

For each one of these matrices, the influence of plasticizers type, plasticizers content, size and quantity of sisal fibers in the composite properties has been studied. The fibers were washed with water at 80 °C during one hour.

The use of a solid plasticizer was feasible for PVC compositions and promoted a better fiber-matrix contact on the composites, increasing mechanical properties for plasticizer quantity over 40 phr, compared to the liquid plasticizer.

Mechanical properties have been executed using Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and rubber hardness tester. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with the energy dispersive spectroscopy was performed to demonstrate the reinforcement’s dispersion, interface quality, char morphology, char–reinforcement interaction, and compositional analysis of the composites. C) oxy–acetylene torch coupled with the temperature data logging system was used to execute the ablation measurements of the ablative composites. The ablation, thermal, and mechanical properties of the fabricated composites have been positively influenced with increasing the concentration of the nanoclays/synthetic fibers/nanotubes in the host rubber matrices. The least backface temperature evolution under 200 s flame exposure, best linear/radial/mass ablation resistance, and the utmost improvement in tensile strength and elongation at break have been observed for 30 wt% nanokaolinite and 7 wt% chopped Kevlar fiber impregnated ablative composites. High thermal stability, heat quenching capability, low thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and remarkable reinforcement–matrix adhesion are identified as the most prominent factors for enhanced ablation performance. The novelty of this research work is the fabrication of new ablative formulations with augmented ablation resistance (linear ablation rate of ~ 0. 002 mm/s) and back-face temperatures in the vicinity of 55 oC. This compares with the ablation rates of 0. 01 mm/s and back-face temperatures 130 o C for contemporary work using elastomeric composites under similar conditions.
