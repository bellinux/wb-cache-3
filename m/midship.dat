5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The <b>midship</b> and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E

25|$|Though {{based on}} the FM {{platform}} used by the V36 generation Skyline, the GT-R uses an evolved Premium <b>Midship</b> (PM) platform. The car retains its heritage by using the chassis code DBA-R35, or simply R35.|$|E
25|$|Tarmo {{had five}} {{coal-fired}} boilers {{for the main}} engines in two boiler rooms and a small auxiliary boiler for heating, deck equipment and electricity generation. Her <b>midship</b> fuel stores could hold 450 tons of coal, which was fed to the fireboxes {{at a rate of}} 3–4 tons per hour by six stokers and was enough for roughly one week of sailing in ice.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{are usually}} decked vessels designed for robustness. Their superstructure (wheelhouse and accommodation) can be forward, <b>midship</b> or aft. Motorised winches, electronic navigation and sonar systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication {{depending on the}} size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Navy {{classified}} {{these ships}} as frigates, as they lacked the torpedo tubes {{needed for a}} destroyer classification. For those used to Admiralty-designed ships the Captains were unfamiliar: they had no break forward of the forecastle but instead had a graceful shear to deck-line from the forecastle to <b>midship,</b> and the Evarts had rakish cowls {{on top of the}} funnels. Those who served on these ships came to view these features as being very handsome. Amongst the differences with British-designed vessels were using bunks instead of hammocks and welds instead of rivets.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a <b>midship</b> A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the <b>midship</b> {{house on the}} bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the shelter deck with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|E

5000|$|The two <b>midships</b> {{watertight}} compartments housed {{machinery and}} gasoline tanks with the machinery space the {{forward of the}} two housing two six cylinder gasoline engines with 600 total horsepower to give a speed of [...] "about 20 mph" [...] and a single General Electric 5 kilowatt gasoline generator. The vessel was equipped with electric windlass, pumps for bilge and sanitary service, lighting, heating and cooking. The aft of the two <b>midships</b> watertight compartments contained three seamless, welded stainless steel tanks for 3000 gal L of gasoline.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the high}} cost of each Yasen class submarine, some sources believe that a new {{generation}} of SSNs would be of smaller dimensions with a reduced armament/payload. The Yasen class successor/supplement is in development and dubbed Husky class by the media. The final design of the submarine is yet to be completed and may feature a more conventional layout with bow-mounted torpedo tubes (as opposed to the <b>midship</b> torpedo tubes on Yasen class submarines) and a smaller chin-mounted sonar, i.e. the sonar will be mounted below the torpedo tubes (as opposed to a large spherical sonar on Yasen class submarines).|$|E
25|$|The keel laying {{ceremony}} {{of the first}} vessel was held on 19 January 2012 when the first block, a 353-ton <b>midship</b> section manufactured in Helsinki, was lowered to the shipyard's covered drydock. Vitus Bering was launched and floated out on 30 June 2012. The hull assembly of the second vessel began in July and she was launched on 23 November 2012, {{one day after the}} first vessel left for one week sea trials. Vitus Bering was delivered to Sovcomflot on 21 December 2012, four months ahead of the original schedule. From Helsinki, she headed for St. Petersburg, where the new vessel was visited by president Vladimir Putin on 10 January 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} changes {{made to the}} Bombo were the fitting of a mast {{amidships}} replacing the original deck crane, a smaller mainmast on the aft deck, {{and a range of}} armaments. Her initial assignment was as an auxiliary minesweeper, and for this role she was fitted with a 12-pound deck gun on an elevated platform forward, two heavy machine-guns amidships, and four anti-submarine depth charges set-up at the stern. In 1944 she was converted to a stores carrier, and modifications included replacing the machine-guns with twin platform-mounted 20mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon, adding a protective shield to the 12-pounder, and fitting twin derricks to the <b>midship</b> mast.|$|E
50|$|The Circé {{class had}} a {{displacement}} of 615 tons surfaced and 776 tons submerged. They had an endurance of 3,500 miles at 7.5 knots, {{with a maximum}} surface speed of 14 knots, and a submerged speed of 7.5 knots. Their armament was seven torpedo tubes (3 forward, 2 <b>midships,</b> and 2 aft) with an outfit of 13 torpedoes. As with all French submarines of this period, the <b>midships</b> torpedo tubes were fitted externally in trainable mounts. They had a single 75 mm and two 8mm machine guns, and were manned by crews of 41 men.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the abovementioned guns, these ships also carry two [...]50 caliber heavy machine guns at the bridgewings, and two Mk.16 cannons at Mk.68 mounts at the <b>midships.</b>|$|R
25|$|As the carracks made contact, Hussain's {{flagship}} was grappled by the Santo Espírito. When their bowcastles crossed, a {{group of}} men led by Rui Pereira jumped onto the enemy bowcastle, and before the ships were secured, already the Portuguese had stormed all the way to <b>midship.</b> Before the flagship was dominated though, another Mamluk carrack came to its aid, boarding the Santo Espírito from the opposite side. Hussain had strenghtened his forces with a great number of Gujarati soldiers, distributed across the ships, and the heavily armoured Portuguese infantry suddenly risked being overwhelmed. Rui Pereira was killed, but at this crucial moment, the Rei Grande slammed against the free side of Hussain's flagship, delivering direly needed reinforcements, which tipped the scales in favour of the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March, Irresistible {{participated in}} the main {{bombardment}} of the Narrows (where the waterway narrows to one mile in width) forts of Çanakkale and Kilitbahir. The Turks had previously noted that the British ships turned to starboard into Erin Keui Bay when withdrawing, and had laid a line of naval mines to intercept this maneuver. Irresistible was badly damaged when she struck one of these mines at about 16:16 local time. The starboard engine room flooded very rapidly, killing all but three of the men on duty there, and then the <b>midship</b> bulkhead collapsed, causing the port engine room to flood and leaving Irresistible without power, listing to starboard, and down by the stern. She drifted helplessly into range of Turkish guns, which laid down a heavy fire on her. Her main gun turrets began to fail, and she was obscured by smoke and spray.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice class rules {{was the way the}} structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, <b>midship,</b> aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of the}} ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum power requirement was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E
