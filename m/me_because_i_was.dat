We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Northrup {{went to a}} {{psychiatrist}} to obtain advice about Hubbard's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, {{and was told that}} he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't want her to be brought up by <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E

She said about her childhood, [...] "I never had any clothes. ... And lots of time didn't have anything to eat. We just lived, that's about all.

2500|$|Despite his {{criticism}} of Zhao, Chen Yun was the Party elder most respected by Zhao, and Zhao would frequently attempt to consult with Chen before implementing new policies. Li Xiannian resented Zhao personally for Zhao's interest in foreign culture, and for Zhao's willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China. According to Zhao, Li Xiannian [...] "hated <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since {{it was difficult for}} him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of the opposition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In failing health, Lange {{retired from}} Parliament before the 1996 general election. In his valedictory speech, he {{reflected}} on the pain caused by his government's economic reforms: [...] "I want to thank those people whose lives were wrecked by us. They had been taught for years they {{had the right to}} an endless treadmill of prosperity and assurance, and we did them. People over 60 hate me. They hate <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the symbol of what caused that assurance of support and security to be shattered. That is something that has always been part of my burden." [...] His Labour Party colleague Taito Phillip Field succeeded him as the member for the Mangere electorate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Moore began {{publishing}} his own poetry and essays in fanzines, eventually setting {{up his own}} fanzine, Embryo. Through Embryo, Moore became involved in a group known as the Northampton Arts Lab. The Arts Lab subsequently {{made significant contributions to}} the magazine. He began dealing the hallucinogenic LSD at school, being expelled for doing so in 1970 – he later described himself as [...] "one of the world's most inept LSD dealers". The headmaster of the school subsequently [...] "got in touch with various other academic establishments that I'd applied to and told them not to accept <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a danger to the moral well-being {{of the rest of the}} students there, which was possibly true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Lords of Chaos interview, Vikernes {{recalls that}} when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to Baghdad, Iraq, because Vikernes' [...] "father was working for Saddam Hussein", {{developing}} a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became [...] "aware of racial matters". Corporal punishment was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion Vikernes had a [...] "quarrel" [...] with a teacher and called him [...] "a monkey". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers [...] "didn't dare to hit <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> white". Vikernes' mother also recalls how they [...] "spent a year in Iraq", and that [...] "the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not". She mentions that this created problems, but generally she [...] "has no good explanation" [...] of how Varg developed his views.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Dancigers {{was busy}} {{producing}} films for the actor/director Fernando Soler, {{one of the}} most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the [...] "national paterfamilias". [...] Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their latest collaboration, El Gran Calavera, based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties. [...] Buñuel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: [...] "I amused myself with the montage, the constructions, the angles... All of that interested <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still an apprentice in so-called 'normal' cinema." [...] As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots. El Gran Calavera was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates). [...] The picture has been described as [...] "a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican nouveau riche... a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides", and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico. [...] In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title The Noble Family. [...] In 1949, Buñuel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican.|$|E
