After Johnson expressed his displeasure with some of the umpire's calls on balls and strikes, Culbreth ejected Johnson in the second inning. Johnson said that he was [...] "deeply regretful" [...] and acknowledged, [...] "I was wrong for letting <b>my</b> <b>emotions</b> get away from me."

He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation. The episode aired five days before Johnny's 22nd birthday, {{and he said he}} would have a viewing party because the episode would be [...] "particularly meaningful" [...] to him. The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT-related television can have a [...] "real impact on people's thinking".|$|E

500|$|As his Beatles era segued {{into his}} solo career, his singing voice found a {{widening}} range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon [...] "tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities {{in a number}} of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] and the cathartic John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's [...] "greatest vocal performance... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically... echoed, filtered, and double tracked." [...] David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from [...] "extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety" [...] to a hard [...] "rasping" [...] style. Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be [...] "at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair". Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' Ed Sullivan Show performance of [...] "This Boy" [...] played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: [...] "As Lennon's vocals reached their peak... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was <b>my</b> <b>emotions</b> I heard in his voice. Just like I always had." ...|$|E

Something goes wrong, {{and he is}} transformed into the monster known as the Lizard. Ifans said his character spends {{the majority of the}} film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, [...] "I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're <b>my</b> <b>emotions.</b> That's how spectacularly advanced technology is." [...] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, [...] "I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard." ...|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep <b>my</b> <b>emotions</b> in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

2500|$|David Denby from The New Yorker {{called the}} film [...] "a superb achievement" [...] and praised the director's [...] "impressive visual skills".

[...] As many of Weber's films focused on a moral topic, she [...] "was often mistaken as a Christian fundamentalist, but she was more of a libertarian, opposing censorship and the death penalty and championing birth control. The need for a strong, loving and nurturing home was clearly promoted as well and if there was a single maxim that underlay each film it was that selfishness and egocentricity erode the individual and community".|$|E

[...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality.

2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R.

Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from <b>my</b> <b>emotions.</b> [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with.

2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when I finally got to match point I went for a winner and I hit it. I had held <b>my</b> <b>emotions</b> in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E
