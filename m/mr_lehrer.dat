5000|$|On June 6, 2013, Simon & Schuster {{announced}} that it would publish a book by Lehrer with the working title The Book of Love. In Slate.com, Daniel Engber suggested that Lehrer might have plagiarized portions of his book proposal from the work of his former New Yorker colleague Adam Gopnik. Both had written about the same episode in the life of Darwin, using the same biography (that of Desmond and Moore) as a source. The book was published as A Book About Love in 2016. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Jennifer Senior described it as [...] "a nonfiction McMuffin" [...] and [...] "insolently unoriginal," [...] containing [...] "a lot of dime-store counsel" [...] and [...] "a series of duckpin arguments, just waiting to be knocked down." [...] She concluded, [...] "Perhaps <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lehrer</b> has changed—personally. But not sufficiently as a writer. I fear it may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do." ...|$|E

Dara Hill Grounded in integrated and excerpt style (Emerson, et al., 1995), this article chronicles <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lehrer,</b> an English teacher who provides his students access to standard and nonstandard writing conventions. Student writing samples and discursive practices illustrate enhanced awareness of distinctions between nonstandard language (African American Vernacular English and European American Vernacular English) and Standard English, {{against the backdrop}} of a suburban school experiencing problems of residency. Also examined is the historical construct that shapes current conditions and disparities between neighboring urban and suburban boundaries. In a climate where many teachers assume the home language of working class Detroit children is deficient, Mr. Lehrer’s practices are improvisational, based on changing demography in his classroom, for he assumes competence and a space for all students to recognize that they appropriate a deviation from Standard English...|$|E
2500|$|The {{record deal}} with Reprise Records for the That Was The Year That Was album also gave Reprise {{distribution}} rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted {{to wind up}} his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live Tom Lehrer Revisited CD. The [...] recording included bonus tracks [...] "L-Y" [...] and [...] "Silent E", two of the ten songs that Lehrer wrote for the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, the album That Was The Year That Was went gold. [...] The album liner notes (and Lehrer himself in one routine) promote his songs with self-deprecating humor. [...] ("I know it's very bad form to quote one's own reviews, {{but there is something}} the New York Times said about me , that I have always treasured: <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lehrer's</b> muse [...] not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.") ...|$|R
