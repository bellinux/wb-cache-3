40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of underground mining and tunneling operations and to realize automatic drilling, {{it is necessary to}} develop the automation system for large drill jumbos. This work focuses on one such <b>mining</b> <b>drill</b> jumbo which is actually a redundant robotic manipulator with eight degrees of freedom, because it has six revolute joints and two prismatic joints. To realize the autonomous drilling operation, algorithms are proposed to calculate the desired pose of the end-effector and to solve the inverse kinematics of the drill jumbo, {{which is one of the}} key issues for developing the automation system. After that, a control strategy is proposed to independently control the eight joint variables using PID feedback control approaches. The simulation model is developed in Simulink. As the closed-loop controllers corresponding to all joints are local and independent of each other, the whole system is not a closed-loop feedback control. In order to estimate the possible maximal pose error, the analysis of the pose error caused by the errors of the joint variables is conducted.

40|$|Decision-making methodologies for {{evaluating}} a product’s end-of-life options {{have become a}} significant area of research. Extensive work {{has been carried out}} in the area of product recovery, e. g. module-based disassemblability, reverse logistics, remanufacturing, material recyclability, among others. Some of these methods use graphical representations in the form of disassembly trees and/or networks to find feasible solutions with computational approaches, but have not been made applicable to larger, more complex electrohydraulic mechanical systems. The work presented in this paper aims to apply a disassembly assessment technique by comparing a component’s disassembly effort to a reward such as recycling value or energy recovery from recycling. First, the disassembly network is represented by a directed graph where weighted edges represent reward/cost. Next, an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the optimal disassembly path that minimizes the sum of the edge weights. Lastly, the optimal disassembly paths for each individual reward are compared to discover the globally optimal disassembly scenario. This method is applied to a real-world case study of an underground <b>mining</b> <b>drill</b> rig with direct contributions from engineers involved {{in the development of the}} machine itself.

40|$|Installation of a {{horizontal}} air-blocking shelf around the inside {{perimeter of the}} surface <b>mining</b> <b>drill</b> deck shroud is proposed to improve dust capture. Without {{the use of this}} shelf, a strong Coand? effect airflow pattern results in dust leakage to the environment, especially at the shroud-to-ground interface. Bailing air exits the drill hole and travels along the drill steel to the underside of the table, where it fans out across the bottom of the drill table and continues down the sides of the shroud. This dust-laden bailing air then strikes the ground and fans out under gaps between the shroud and the ground. The proposed shelf prevents dust-laden air from striking the ground by redirecting it {{toward the center of the}} enclosure, where it can be captured. Laboratory tests demonstrated that the shelf reduced dust levels outside of the shroud by 81 % under operating conditions consisting of a 1. 9 : 1 collector-to-bailing-airflow ratio and a 51 -mm (2 -in.) gap between the shroud and ground. The shelf was 152 -mm (6 -in.) wide and was located at a height equal to 2 / 3 the distance measured from the bottom of the shroud to the bottom of the drill table.

Preliminary boundary materials of interest include but are not limited to: W metal, WC-Co, W-Co, WFeNi, and Mo metal and alloys. Several FM test coupons were fabricated with various compositions using the above listed materials. These coupons were consolidated to varying degrees by uniaxial hot pressing, then cut and ground to expose the FM cell structure. One promising system, WC-Co core and WFeNi boundary, was consolidated to 97 % of theoretical density, and demonstrates excellent hardness. Data on standard mechanical tests was gathered, and tests will begin on the consolidated test coupons during the upcoming reporting period. The program statements of work for ACR Inc. and its subcontractors, as well as the final contract negotiations, were finalized during the current reporting period.

40|$|Lanthanides, {{also called}} rare earth {{elements}} (REE) are key elements in modern technologies and especially in green technologies such as energy generation through wind power. Thus, they are of considerable economic importance with a global production of around 124 000 t REE per year. A detailed environmental assessment with identification of all risks is the foundation to assess the sustainability of mining, processing and separation processes. Rare earth elements usually are found together with actinides such as uranium and thorium. Therefore, actinides and their decay products are simultaneously enriched during the processing of REE. In addition to conventional REE minerals such as monazite or bastnasite, the mineral eudialyte {{can be used as}} a REE source. Even though, the total share of REE is low, the most important REE needed for industrial usages are strongly represented in eudialyte. Furthermore, the proportion of radioactive impurities is very low. Eudialyte is currently not used as source mineral, but might play a bigger role on the global market in the future. Little information about the environmental impacts of REE-production is available to the public, in particular with regard to its radioactive by-products. Thorium is the most prominent of these and has therefore been characterized in detail for its ecotoxicity. A first goal of this work was to evaluate the α- emitter thorium and its impact on the environment. To this aim, an intensive literature search was conducted and results were prepared including the long-term effects of thorium dust and gaseous emissions. Therefore and because ecotoxicological testing of gaseous emissions was technically difficult and environmentally less relevant – unlike its immense impact for exposed industrial workers and bystanders – the water effluent und solid waste streams were investigated with aquatic and terrestrial toxicological experiments. The knowledge gained is meant to supplement the missing data for thorium. A throughout analysis of thorium fluxes along the process of SEE recovery was carried out, and the effects of disposals and other products involved were measured based on ecotoxicological tests with aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In experiments with thorium exclusively the heavy metal property was regarded since radiation effects with a radioactivity half-life of approximately 14 billion years play a subordinate role in typical ecotoxicological testing periods. Moreover, it should be noted that thorium occurs in nature alongside its decay products. Th(OH) 4 at pH 6. 5 to 8 showed no toxic effects in all organisms studied, aquatic (bacteria, algae and daphnia) and terrestrial (springtails, earthworms). Thorium thus does not appear to be a problem in the range of water solubility and in soil concentrations typical found. The effects of process wastewater from various process steps in the production of REE were evaluated based on eudialyte, which was investigated as an example for REE minerals. Figure 1 shows the investigated process steps of eudialyte: after <b>mining,</b> <b>drill,</b> blast and load haul operation, the ore is milled and grinded. In order to enrich it, the wanted mineral is flotated. Afterwards chemicals (acids) are added to dissolve the minerals. Impurities are removed by pH adjustment and precipitation which is also used for REE separation later. Stronger REE separation is achieved by solvent extraction and finally pure REE are obtained by electrolysis. Ground and flotated eudialyte had no or very little ecotoxicological effects. By contrast, leaching residues showed that concentrations which arise during production have a negative impact on all tested organisms (see figure 1). Due to mixture toxicity, it is difficult to estimate which compound is responsible for the total toxicity. It is known that the toxicity of metals differs in various organisms. A general trend shows the following toxicity sequence: Hg> Ag> Cu> Cd> Zn> Ni> Pb> Cr> Sn (Luoma & Rainbow 2011; Merian et al. 2004; F. Scheffer & Schachtschabel 2010). In soil the pH value (soil acidity) has the greatest impact on the metal availability. If the pH value increases, the mobility of heavy metals decreases and thus their availability is reduced. The current study showed that residues from rare earth mining should be stored in a way that ensures that wash-out processes do not affect the water or soil systems. Even tailing dams should be avoided, since otherwise leaching residues can still be washed out, and, on the other hand, terrestrial organisms may be adversely affected. In conclusion, the dumping of leaching residues should be monitored so that they will not pass freely to stockpiles. Additionally, it is important to avoid fine dust which is produced by grinding processes and must not drift. This can be achieved by continuous humidification of stockpiles...|$|E
