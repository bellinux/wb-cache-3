50|$|The north fort {{which is}} on the {{opposite}} side of the town is penetrated by deep canyon-likecrevices, through which climbs a straight path. The first features to be seen along this path are two freestanding, multi-storeyed mandapas, seemingly unconnected with any temples. They are possibly vestiges of an early ceremonial complexes. Lower Shivalaya stands on a nearby rocky terrace, surveying the houses beneath. At the summit of north fort, upper Shivalaya is sited majestically overlooking the town beneath. Both these were probably erected in the early 7th century, but appear to have partly dismantled mostly by conquering pallava forces; and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been pillaged for building blocks to strengthen north fort by later occupiers.

50|$|Solution focused {{therapists}} {{attempt to}} create a judgement-free zone for clients where what is going well, what areas of life are problem-free are discussed. Problem-free talk can be useful for uncovering hidden resources, to help the person relax, or become more naturally pro-active, for example. Solution focused therapists may talk about seemingly irrelevant life experiences such as leisure activities, meeting with friends, relaxing and managing conflict. This often uncovers client values, beliefs and strengths. From this discussion the therapist can use these strengths and resources to move the therapy forward. For example; if a client wants to be more assertive it may be that under certain life situations they are assertive. This strength from one part of their life can then be transferred-generalized to another area where new behavior is desired. Perhaps a client is struggling with their child because the child gets aggressive and calls the parent names. If the parent continually retaliates and also gets angry, perhaps they can recall another area of their life where they remain calm even under pressure; or <b>maybe,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> trained a dog successfully who now behaves and can identify how kindness, patience and consistency were keys to eliciting the dog's good behavior. This could lead to discussion of using kindness, patience and consistency to create healthy boundaries the child might cooperate with.|$|E
5000|$|To illustrate, we may use {{the theory}} of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right:A {{programme}} can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, {{the two sides have}} hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non-rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other’s opinions and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissenimation overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can’t compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of [...] "dissemination"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that “ the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.” ...|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of how mild hypothermia could reduce CMRO 2 is still unclear. Recent {{studies have shown}} that mild hypothermia and anesthesia can both reduce cerebral oxygen metabolism safely (Ouchi et al. 2006). But <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> different mechanisms. One study found that (Michenfelder 2002), constant infusion of anesthetic initially produced the expected progressive decrease in CMRO 2 until a mean decrease to about 58 %. Thereafter, despite continued administration of anesthetic, no further effect on CMRO 2 was observed. Anesthetics, mainly by reducing cerebral electrical activity to decrease CMRO 2, revealed no alteration in normal cerebral metabolic pathways, hence it would provide no cerebral protection during hypoxia. In another study, German scholars observed the effect of mild hypothermia on CMRO 2 and cerebral function through an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), and subsequent decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) to reduce CBF (Bauer et al. 2000). This study found that mild hypothermia improved cerebral oxygen balance by reduction of brain energy demand. The brain electrical activity was less suppressed under hypothermia during severe blood flow reduction, which indicated that hypothermic neuroprotection may involve some other mechanisms. And further studies are needed to make it clear.|$|E
40|$|According to Daniel Dennett the {{evolutionary}} algorithm {{of natural selection}} has crafted religious beliefs (Dennett 2006). <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been useful {{for us in the}} past, but now they are nothing more than an ancient remnant. Moreover, Dennett thinks religious beliefs make us act in ways that do not benefit our own survival, but only the survival of the beliefs in question. To assess his claim {{we have to look at}} his major premise: culture is build out of memes (Dennett 1991, 1995, 2006). I present his interpretation of a memetic view on culture in the first part of this article. In the second part I refer to ecological research that suggests a broadening of Dennett's view. Religion can be situated in the context of a human ecological niche, relating people with their environment. Anthropological research suggests that religion plays an important role in the construction and management of such a niche. Assessing both the possibilities and limits of considering religion as a tool for human niche building, I conclude by pleading for an ongoing dialogue between science and religion, focussed at the care for the future of our planet. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to reflect upon how people {{perceive}} places based on their experiences of places. I will discuss following questions: do they consider home as special places with which they compare places later in their lives? Would they rather think that the other places which they have visited later on in their life have been more important for them to understand their perception of place? Do they tend to prefer landscapes which are similar to their childhood landscape? Do they consider themselves attached to one certain place or they think they are mobile person? Do they believe that somewhere else is always better than where they currently are? <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> thought why it might be so? In order to reflect upon these questions I conducted an interview study where I discussed these things with six landscape architect students who are on their last year of studies. As I personally think that these themes are important for landscape architect to try to understand, I wanted to see if my fellow students have been thinking on these themes and what are their opinions.

This article is an introduction to the world of low-tech. "High-tech seems to be a self-corroborating superlative which needs no justification. Isn't perfecting technology an obvious consequence of the development of mankind, and actually of its natural evolution? And then, isn't contradicting this thesis a dangerous heresy, a crime, or an absurd at best? This reminds me of Orwell's 1984, where a new language is created in which it is impossible to express ideas other than those propagated by the state. There are however those who have undermined the dogma of technological progress as the only value and measure of civilisation. They are believers in low-tech.

Relativists are bound to say: 'everyone is right because everyone has different needs. ' Let us not, however, go for the easiest solution available.
