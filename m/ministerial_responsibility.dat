5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral {{legislature}} with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and {{are elected}} {{on a first}} past the post system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally five years from 2011–16). The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the Monarch to serve as First Minister. Other ministers are appointed by the First Minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government. The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister, who is accountable to the Scottish Parliament and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The First Minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the Deputy First Minister, currently John Swinney MSP, who deputises for the First Minister {{during a period of}} absence of overseas visits. Alongside the Deputy First Minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Swinney is also currently Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills. The Scottish Government's cabinet comprises nine cabinet secretaries, who form the Cabinet of Scotland. There are also twelve other ministers, who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas. As a result, junior ministers do not attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} {{financial}} initiative was not, however, absolute. Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them. Standing Order 66 therefore represents {{the beginnings of}} <b>Ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> and accountability.|$|E

25|$|The {{legislature}} exercises a check {{upon the}} executive by imposing a weak sanction through {{the doctrine of}} individual <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Cabinet ministers may {{be called upon to}} justify their policies in Parliament by elected MPs (backbenchers belonging to the ruling party and opposition MPs), as well as non-elected Members (Non-constituency members of parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated members of parliament (NMPs)).|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of individual <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> is a constitutional convention adopted from the Westminster constitutional model. According to this doctrine, Parliament imposes {{a check on}} the Cabinet by scrutinising government bills and actions, and calling upon ministers to justify policies before the House in open debate. This ensures that the Cabinet is accountable not only to Parliament but also to the public, who have access to transcripts of Parliamentary debates.|$|E
25|$|In October 1945, the Gen 75 Committee {{considered}} {{the issue of}} <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for atomic energy. The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, and the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy both recommended that it be placed within the Ministry of Supply. Developing atomic energy would require an enormous construction effort, which the Ministry of Supply was best equipped to undertake. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945.|$|E

25|$|Given the one-party {{dominance}} in Singapore, the opposition MPs in Parliament {{play a crucial}} role in checking the executive. They enforce the doctrine of <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> by providing constructive criticism of executive policies. They are also entitled to vote for or against bills and motions, but this may exercise little influence over majoritarian power. As such, the effectiveness of the opposition hinges on its ability to keep the executive, as well as the majority party, vigilant and accountable to society.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2006, McKay {{served as}} Parliamentary Secretary to then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale. Paul Martin, {{during his tenure}} as Prime Minister, {{implemented}} a number of reforms aimed at making parliament more democratic. One of these reforms gave greater authority to MPs serving as parliamentary secretary to a Minister, in contrast to their previous role that had been largely clerical with little purview over government policy. To this end, McKay was given <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{for the improvement of}} partnerships between the public and private sectors.|$|E
25|$|Dugdale's {{resignation}} {{went down}} in history as an honourable, even heroic, one: a minister taking responsibility for civil servants' actions, which would lead to the perceived code of individual <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> However, in papers released thirty years after the affair, it was found that Dugdale had known and approved of his civil servants' actions and had to an extent passed the buck to them himself. It was also found that the inquiry was inaccurate and biased, led by a former Conservative candidate who was very against civil servants and state interference.|$|E

Gallager's <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were unchanged in the first arrangement of the second Stanhope ministry and, on 20 April 2006, following the retirement of Ted Quinlan, she was promoted to Deputy Chief Minister with <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> including health, disability and community services, and women. The ministry for children and young people was restored to Gallagher's responsibilities on 17 April 2007.|$|R
50|$|For a short period, between 29 May 1991 and 18 June 1991, {{there was}} no Deputy Chief Minister as the Chief Minister, Trevor Kaine, has assumed all <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibilities.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the Rebellions of 1837, Lord Durham in his Durham Report, {{recommended}} that Upper and Lower Canada be joined as the Province of Canada {{and that the}} new province should have a responsible government. As a result of Durham's report, the British Parliament passed the Act of Union 1840, and the Province of Canada was formed in 1841. The new province was divided into two parts: Canada West (the former Upper Canada) and Canada East (the former Lower Canada). Governor General Lord Elgin granted <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> in 1848, first to Nova Scotia and then to Canada. In the following years, the British would extend responsible government to Prince Edward Island (1851), New Brunswick (1854), and Newfoundland (1855).|$|E
25|$|Clark's Labour Party {{became the}} largest party in Parliament {{following}} {{the general election}} of 1999, with 49 seats to National's 39. Clark became the second woman to serve as Prime Minister of New Zealand, {{and the first to}} have won office at an election. She also served as the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage throughout her premiership. She had additional <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) and for Ministerial Services. During her period in office, women held a number of prominent elected and appointed offices in New Zealand, such as the Governor-General, Speaker of the House of Representatives and Chief Justice—these major offices of state were simultaneously occupied by women between March 2005 and August 2006. As a female head of government, Clark {{was a member of the}} Council of Women World Leaders.|$|E
25|$|William II, who {{was more}} popular than his father, was also more {{willing to listen to}} his advisors. When the Revolutions of 1848 raged {{throughout}} Europe, with nationalists and liberals revolting and sometimes killing noblemen and royals in the process, William II was genuinely concerned for his safety and to lose his powers. Overnight, he changed from a conservative to a liberal, and agreed to the far-reaching Constitutional Reform of 1848 on 11 October 1848. He accepted the introduction of full <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> in the constitution, leading to a system of parliamentary democracy, with the House of Representatives directly elected by the voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts. Parliament was accorded the right to amend government law proposals and to hold investigative hearings. The States-Provincial, themselves elected by the voter, appointed by majorities for each province the members of the Senate from a select group of upper class citizens. A commission chaired by the liberal Thorbecke was appointed to draft the new proposed constitution, which was finished on 19 June. Suffrage was enlarged (though still limited to census suffrage), as was the bill of rights with the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.|$|E

500|$|Millen {{organised}} {{the passage}} of the War Service Homes Act 1918–19, which established the War Service Homes Commission, but the administration of the scheme by Commissioner J. T. Walker led to a series of parliamentary inquiries by the joint committee of public accounts. Walker's appointment by Millen came into question, and the resulting investigation into the Commissioner's accountability to the Minister and to Parliament has been described as [...] "one of the fullest examinations of ... <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the actions of an autonomous public corporation {{in the history of the}} Commonwealth Parliament".|$|E
500|$|The Emperor's {{efforts to}} appease the Liberal Party {{resulted}} in very important changes. He supported an 1827 law that established <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> On 19 March 1831, he named a cabinet formed by politicians drawn from the opposition, allowing a greater role for the parliament in the government. Lastly, he offered positions in Europe to Francisco Gomes and another Portuguese-born friend to extinguish rumors of a [...] "secret cabinet". To his dismay, his palliative measures did not stop the continuous attacks from the Liberal side upon his government and his foreign birth. Frustrated by their intransigence, he became unwilling {{to deal with his}} deteriorating political situation.|$|E
500|$|In February 1973, the Attorney General, Senator Lionel Murphy, led {{a police}} {{raid on the}} Melbourne office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which was under his <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Murphy {{believed}} that ASIO might have files relating to threats against Yugoslav Prime Minister Džemal Bijedić, {{who was about to}} visit Australia, and feared ASIO might conceal or destroy them. The Opposition attacked the Government over the raid, terming Murphy a [...] "loose cannon". A Senate investigation of the incident was cut short when Parliament was dissolved in 1974. According to journalist and author Wallace Brown, the controversy over the raid continued to dog the Whitlam government throughout its term, because the incident was [...] "so silly".|$|E

500|$|Denny was {{appointed}} Attorney-General of South Australia and Minister controlling the Northern Territory on 3 June 1910. After conducting {{negotiations with the}} Commonwealth Government, he relinquished his <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Northern Territory on 31 December 1910, when its administration {{was transferred to the}} Commonwealth. During his time as Attorney-General, Denny drafted and led several important legislative reforms. These included the Advances for Homes Act 1910, which allowed for 80 per cent of the value of a property to be advanced to a worker at 4.5 per cent interest over 36.5 years. In his speeches Denny highlighted that many workers were faced with high rents and poor conditions. He also sponsored the Female Law Practitioners Act 1911, which enabled women to practice law in South Australia for the first time. Tall, with [...] "long, spindly legs", Denny was a favourite of cartoonists.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won the election. Despite later calling Labour under Tony Blair [...] "the {{idea of a}} Conservative {{group who}} had taken over Labour" [...] and saying [...] " [...] {{set up a new}} {{political}} party, New Labour", Benn's political diaries Free at Last show that Benn was initially somewhat sympathetic to Blair, welcoming a change of government. Benn supported the introduction of the national minimum wage, and welcomed the progress towards peace and security in Northern Ireland (particularly under Mo Mowlam). He was supportive of the extra public money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation. Overall, his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement, adopting a presidentialist style of politics, overriding the concept of the collective <b>ministerial</b> <b>responsibility</b> by reducing the power of the Cabinet, eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and [...] "hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history".|$|E

Developing atomic energy would require an enormous construction effort, which the Ministry of Supply was best equipped to undertake. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945. To coordinate the atomic energy effort, {{it was decided to}} appoint a Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE). The Minister of Supply, John Wilmot, suggested Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff. Portal was reluctant to accept the post, as he felt that he lacked administrative experience outside the Royal Air Force, but eventually accepted it for a two-year term, commencing in March 1946. In this role he had direct access to the Prime Minister. Portal ran the project until 1951, when he was succeeded by Sir Frederick Morgan. He established his headquarters at Shell Mex House on the Strand, London, where the wartime Tube Alloys had been. Special security barriers were installed to close off this section of the offices, giving the area the nickname [...] "the Cage".|$|E
