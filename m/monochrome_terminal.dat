50|$|During the 1970s, as an {{outgrowth}} of its defense work, Hazeltine Corp. developed the Hazeltine <b>Terminal,</b> an early <b>monochrome</b> computer <b>terminal,</b> eventually selling that line to a short-lived third party called Esprit, which was managed by ex-Hazeltine employees.|$|R
50|$|The VT520 is an ANSI {{standard}} {{computer terminal}} introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1993 and 1994. The VT520 is multi-session <b>monochrome</b> text <b>terminal.</b> The VT525 added color support, while the VT510 was a single-session, text-only version {{with a built-in}} monitor. The VT525 {{appears to be the}} most popular model in the series.|$|R
5000|$|A minimal {{system was}} {{delivered}} in a single 19&Prime; rack about 60&Prime; high with the card cage in the bottom, the disk drive in the middle, the tape drive above it, then the 2 inch high control panel with a floppy disk drive and ignition key on the top. This was considered very compact at the time. At least one machine in Australia spend six months installed in a retired outdoor lavatory with an air-conditioner replacing the louvered window and the system console terminal {{sitting on top of}} the cabinet. Administration tasks were performed al-fresco. The only indicator on the control panel was an 8 segment bar graph LED display that displayed average CPU usage when the machine was running and a [...] "Cylon Eye" [...] pattern when the machine stopped unexpectedly. The machine was low enough that the console (a <b>monochrome</b> asynchronous <b>terminal)</b> could rest on top.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} quantitative {{measurements of}} the non-ionising (radio-frequency, ultraviolet and visible) and ionising (x-ray) electromagnetic radiation emitted from 67 different colour and <b>monochrome</b> video display <b>terminals.</b> Measurements of the electric field strength and the magnetic field strength were made over the range of frequencies from 14 kHz to 100 MHz. Broadband measurements from 10 MHz to 26 GHz were also made. Ultraviolet spectral irradiance measurements were made over the wavelength range 320 to 400 nm. The visible (400 to 750 nm) spectral irradiance was also measured. The results have been compared with Australian and International occupational and general public recommended exposure limits. Relative to these limits, the emission levels are low to very low. It is therefore concluded that electromagnetic radiation emissions from VDTs do not pose a health hazard to operators...|$|R
40|$|The Windowed Observation of Relative Motion, WORM, {{program is}} {{primarily}} {{intended for the}} generation of simple X-Y plots from data created by other programs. It allows the user to label, zoom, and change the scale of various plots. Three dimensional contour and line plots are provided, although with more limited capabilities. The input data can be in binary or ASCII format, although all data {{must be in the}} same format. A great deal of control over the details of the plot is provided, such as gridding, size of tick marks, colors, log/semilog capability, time tagging, and multiple and phase plane plots. Many color and <b>monochrome</b> graphics <b>terminals</b> and hard copy printer/plotters are supported. The WORM executive commands, menu selections and macro files can be used to develop plots and tabular data, query the WORM Help library, retrieve data from input files, and invoke VAX DCL commands. WORM generated plots are displayed on local graphics terminals and can be copied using standard hard copy capabilities. Some of the graphics features of WORM include: zooming and dezooming various portions of the plot; plot documentation including curve labeling and function listing; multiple curves on the same plot; windowing of multiple plots and insets of the same plot; displaying a specific on a curve; and spinning the curve left, right, up, and down. WORM is written in PASCAL for interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX computer operating under VMS 4. 7 with a virtual memory requirement of approximately 392 K of 8 bit bytes. It uses the QPLOT device independent graphics library included with WORM. It was developed in 1988...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} Transportable Applications Executive (TAE) for {{prototyping}} {{user interfaces}} has been the prime force behind the new TAE research and development work. The Data Systems Technology Division at GSFC is developing prototypes of user interfaces for different functions involved in the operation, analysis and data communication of space station payloads. TAE is a valuable prototyping tool because it enables a developer to build an entire application user interface model and run it without writing a single line of application code. One force driving new development {{is the need to}} update TAE's user interface to support the latest interactive graphic device technology. The current TAE, TAE Classic, uses interface techniques designed for an 80 x 24 character <b>monochrome</b> alphanumeric <b>terminal,</b> but does not effectively utilize features such as windowing, graphics, color, and selection devices available on newer workstations. To meet our needs, development of a TAE Plus began in FY- 86 and involves augmenting TAE with three different sets of tools: a user interface toolkit; an application toolkit; and run-time service subroutines. A phased approach is being used to develop TAE Plus. In the first phase, we have met the needs of the user community and provided some support for rapid prototyping by developing a TAE Facelift, which adds an enhanced TAE interface (with windowing, mouse interaction, pull-down menus, etc.) to a select set of graphic workstations. The TAE Facelift allows many new concepts to be tested quickly for feedback and performance. In the second phase, a fully-integrated user interface management system, TAE Plus, will be built that supports the separation of interface from application, with the concomitant ability to prototype and rapidly change interfaces. This robust functionality will support, in an integrated manner, an application's development cycle from the prototype step through to the fully operational system...|$|R
