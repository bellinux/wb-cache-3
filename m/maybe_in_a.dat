Then again, she could just be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius.

2500|$|The {{developments}} raised {{interest among}} the ethnic Romanian community of Transylvania, whose cultural body, the ASTRA Society, {{was in the}} process of creating its own permanent exhibit of folk architecture, later ASTRA National Museum Complex. ASTRA activist Octavian Tăslăuanu reported in 1909: [...] " [...] national art museum, although [...] important sums were spent on it, is at the early stage of its beginnings. Only two years ago did more systematic work begin for its endowment and presently, its national significance recognized, the state granted it a yearly sum of 14,000 lei [...] And <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few years those who are running it, so diligently, will manage to turn it into an institution of great importance for our national art." [...] The next year, Tzigara himself wrote, in Convorbiri Literare, that Tăslăuanu's work with ASTRA permanent exhibits was far more advanced than his when it came to storage and display, but noted that the ASTRA collections were not yet rich enough to validate the [...] "museum" [...] name.|$|E

6000|$|There {{must always}} be a certain effect of {{hardness}} and thinness about Utopian speculations. Their common fault is to be comprehensively jejune. That which is the blood and warmth and reality of life is largely absent; there are no individualities, but only generalised people. In almost every Utopia--except, perhaps, Morris's [...] "News from Nowhere"--one sees handsome but characterless buildings, symmetrical and perfect cultivations, and a multitude of people, healthy, happy, beautifully dressed, but without any personal distinction whatever. Too often the prospect resembles the key {{to one of those}} large pictures of coronations, royal weddings, parliaments, conferences, and gatherings so popular in Victorian times, in which, instead of a face, each figure bears a neat oval with its index number legibly inscribed. This burthens us with an incurable effect of unreality, and I do not see how it is altogether to be escaped. It is a disadvantage that has to be accepted. Whatever institution has existed or exists, however irrational, however preposterous, has, by virtue of its contact with individualities, an effect of realness and rightness no untried thing may share. It has ripened, it has been christened with blood, it has been stained and mellowed by handling, it has been rounded and dented to the softened contours that we associate with life; it has been salted, <b>maybe,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brine of tears. But the thing that is merely proposed, the thing that is merely suggested, however rational, however necessary, seems strange and inhuman in its clear, hard, uncompromising lines, its unqualified angles and surfaces.|$|E

5000|$|Despite Qa'a´s {{long and}} prosperous reign, {{evidence}} shows that after his death, a dynastic war between different royal houses began over the newly empty throne. In {{the tomb of the}} high official Merka, a stone vessel with the name of a king Sneferka was found. It is unclear whether [...] "Sneferka" [...] was an alternate name of Qa'a or if he was a separate, ephemeral ruler. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Toby Wilkinson point to a further mysterious ruler named [...] "Horus Bird", whose name was found on vessel fragments dating {{to the end of the}} first dynasty. It is postulated that Sneferka and Horus Bird fought for power and that Hotepsekhemwy ended the fight and finally ascended the throne of Egypt, thus starting the Second Dynasty. Strong clues to that theory are traces of grave robberies and arsons found in the royal tombs of Abydos. Clay seals of Hotepsekhemwy found in Qa'a's tomb suggest that he restored the tomb or buried Qa'a, <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to legitimize his rule.|$|R
