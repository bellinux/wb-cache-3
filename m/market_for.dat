40|$|Price {{formation}} {{and integration of}} markets supplied by both farmed and captured fish is studied. <b>Markets</b> <b>for</b> trout and potential substitutes imported to Germany are analysed, and market delineation and market leaders identified. It is found that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> small portion-sized farmed trout with white meat are related to, rather than completely separate from, other fish markets, and that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> these trout are more closely linked to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> captured fish than to farmed salmon. The implications are that although {{the part of the}} trout business operating with small freshwater ponds remains relatively unaffected by developments in other fish markets, careful attention should be paid to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> and management of capture fisheries like cod, halibut, redfish, and mackerel, than to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> farmed salmon.

40|$|We study <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> {{information}} {{goods and}} find that they differ significantly from <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> traditional industrial goods. <b>Markets</b> <b>for</b> information goods in which products are vertically differentiated lack the segmentation inherent in <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> industrial goods. As a result, a monopoly will offer only a single product. Competition leads to highly concentrated information-good markets, with the leading firm behaving almost like a monopoly even with free entry and without network effects.

5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the <b>market</b> <b>for</b> edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the <b>market</b> <b>for</b> cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperIn this paper, a {{new test}} for {{causality}} in demand on markets supplied by both farmed and captured fish is presented. This method is applied on <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> trout and potential substitutes imported to Germany, to identify market delineation and causality in demand. It is found that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> small portion-sized farmed trout with white meat are relative, but not completely, separate from other fish <b>markets,</b> that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> these trout are more {{closely linked to}} <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> captured fish than to farmed salmon, and that prices on partially integrated markets including trout are weakly exogenous to quantities. The modelling implication is that consistent demand analysis {{in the present case}} claims the use of ordinary demand systems. The policy implications are that although the part of the trout business operating with small freshwater ponds remains relatively unaffected by developments on other fish markets, they should pay more careful attention to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> and management of capture fisheries...|$|R
