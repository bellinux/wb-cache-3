40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} panel {{approach}} to study population growth in <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> around the world. We find that <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> grow faster in relatively backward economies and in more volatile, faster-growing economies. We also find {{that the effects of}} trade policy on the growth of <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> hinge heavily on geography. While population growth in <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> located at or near ports does not change after an upsurge of trade flows, population growth in landlocked <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> tends to slow down after the same event. On the other hand, we do not find any effect of political regime on the population growth of <b>major</b> <b>cities.</b> Finally, we find some evidence that, other things being equal, larger cities tend to grow at smaller rates...|$|R
