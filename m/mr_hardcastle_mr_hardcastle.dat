50|$|Among her {{characters}} were Miss Prue, Anne Page, Perdita, Ophelia, Miss Hoyden, Nerissa, Æmilia, Doll Tearsheet, Duenna, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> She played in Dublin in 1751-2, and probably in 1753-4, and acted the ‘Irish Widow’ at Bristol so late as 4 July 1781. But for the rivalry of Mrs. Clive, {{she would have}} been the best representative on the stage of old ladies and abigails. Her farewell of the London stage took place 26 May 1780, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> She died at her house at Jacob's Well, Bristol, in the winter of 1791.|$|R
50|$|Tony Lumpkin {{is the son}} of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> and stepson to <b>Mr</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> It is as {{a result}} of his {{practical}} joking that the comic aspects of the play are set up. When he accidentally meets Charles Marlow and his friend Hastings, who are coming to see Tony's parents in order to put Marlow forward as a suitor to Tony's stepsister Kate, he deliberately misdirects them, causing them to believe that the house where they are bound is an inn and that the Hardcastles are its landlord and landlady.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960 Mount {{played the}} Nurse in Franco Zeffirelli's {{production}} of Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic. The notices for her (and the production) were tepid, but the role remained {{one of her}} two favourites, along with Emma Hornett. In the same Old Vic season she played <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> in She Stoops to Conquer for which her notices were uniformly excellent. Tynan commented, [...] "We shall not soon see a <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> who scolds, capers, coquettes and bellows with anything like the majestic, intimidating authority of Peggy Mount. For her sake alone I recommend a visit." ...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{it can be}} seen as a satire, where {{characters}} are presented as either ludicrous or eccentric. Such a comedy might leave the impression that the {{characters are}} either too foolish or corrupt to ever reform, hence <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wealthy countryman <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> {{arranges}} for {{his daughter}} Kate to meet Charles Marlow, {{the son of a}} rich Londoner, hoping the pair will marry. Unfortunately, Marlow prefers lower class women, finding them less intimidating than women of high society. On his first acquaintance with Kate, the latter realises she will have to pretend to be 'common' to get Marlow to woo her. Thus Kate 'stoops to conquer', by posing as a maid, hoping to put Marlow at his ease so he falls for her. Marlow sets out for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle's</b> manor with a friend, George Hastings, an admirer of Miss Constance Neville, another young lady who lives with the Hardcastles. During the journey the two men get lost and stop at an alehouse, The Three Jolly Pigeons, for directions.|$|R

50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} famous modern incarnations of She Stoops to Conquer was Peter Hall's version, staged in 1993 and {{starring}} Miriam Margolyes as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> The most famous TV production is the 1971 version featuring Ralph Richardson, Tom Courtenay, Juliet Mills and Brian Cox, with Trevor Peacock as Tony Lumpkin.

Tony despises the thought of marrying Constance — he prefers a barmaid at the alehouse — and so agrees to steal the jewels from his mother's safekeeping for Constance, so she can elope to France with Hastings.|$|R
50|$|Noel Drayton (October 7, 1913 - December 7, 1981) was {{an actor}} who remains {{perhaps best known for}} playing {{supporting}} roles in Hollywood films like Elephant Walk, The Court Jester, Plymouth Adventure and Botany Bay during the 1950s.

50|$|Farren, {{like his}} father, ripened slowly. It {{was not until}} middle age, when {{juvenile}} roles were abandoned, that he gradually established himself in public favour. One {{of the last of}} the traditional representatives of the Sir Anthony Absolutes and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastles</b> of classic English comedy, he achieved in Sir Peter Teazle, according to the critics of 1896, 'a masterpiece of sheer virtuosity,' but he lacked his father's powers, and his gifts of humorous expression were confined to the dry and caustic.|$|R

Frasier visits <b>Mr</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> and shows him the trunk of records in the boot of his car. After examining the record, Cecil offers to buy a handful of the records but Frasier is horrified to find out that each record only has a value of two pence each.|$|R

50|$|No man on {{the stage}} was more {{versatile}} at this period of his career. His personation of Sir Hugh Evans in the Merry Wives of Windsor was excellent.

He played with great success <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> in She stoops to conquer, Clod in Young Quaker, Rupert in Jealous Wife, Sir Anthony Absolute in The Rivals, Major Sturgeon in The Mayor of Garrett, Governor Heartall in The Soldier's Daughter, and Dr. Cantwell in The Hypocrite at the Lyceum on 23 Jan. 1810. As Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt and James Leigh Hunt record in many reviews, he excelled in the roles of peppery old buffers - apparently offstage as well as on; he was known for throwing his wig into the fire in a rage, and according to an old edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable was referred to personally as Sir Anthony Absolute.|$|R
50|$|Daniel also {{realised}} that Mrs. Trentham's {{hatred of}} the Trumpers stems from him, as Rebecca named Guy Trentham as his father at the time. While Mrs. Trentham was blocking the build of the large department store, as well as building dreadful flats with her property, Daniel decides {{to take matters into}} his own hand by dressing as Guy, knowing his similar appearance will force Mrs. Trentham into acknowledging him as her grandson. He successfully bargains with her, getting her to drop her objections to the store and drop the hideous flats, but is asked to give up any claim to the <b>Hardcastle</b> (<b>Mrs.</b> Trentham's father) estate in return. He does so, but feels uneasy about it afterwards.|$|R

At this time she joked with Terry Wogan and Michael Barrymore on their TV shows that she was aged not 70 but [...] "sixty-several" [...] and could still kick her leg higher than her head, which brought much audience laughter.

500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|R
