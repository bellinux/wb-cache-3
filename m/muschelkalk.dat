25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises <b>muschelkalk</b> beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of <b>muschelkalk</b> run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze {{it can be seen that}} this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.|$|E
500|$|Remains of Batrachotomus {{have been}} found in {{southern}} Germany, mainly in the Kupferzell fossil locality in northern Baden-Württemberg. Fossil collector [...] Johann G. Wegele discovered the first specimens in a 1977 excavation at the Erfurt Formation, dated from the Longobardian (late Ladinian) age. Other remains attributed to Batrachotomus have been collected in Vellberg-Eschenau, about 10km east of Schwäbisch Hall, and in Crailsheim. The most notable are from Vellberg-Eschenau, which are represented by well preserved ribs and vertebrae (MHI 1895), and evidence of forelimbs and hindlimbs (SMNS 90018). Batrachotomus today is displayed in the <b>Muschelkalk</b> Museum, Ingelfingen, Stuttgart.|$|E

50|$|During {{the next}} time period, a thick {{sequence}} of dark limestones was formed - the Alpine <b>muschelkalks</b> - which, when struck, often smell slightly of bitumen and are striking because of their uneven, irregular surface layers. Irregularly shaped, dark brown to black hornfels nodules (Knauern) and greenish tuffs occur in these limestones that indicate the presence of nearby Stromboli-like volcanoes. This sequence arose from a shallow, oxygen-rich marine environment, in which reefs and basins alternated with one another. Some time afterwards the Partnach Strata were formed that are especially attractive in the Schwärz between the Marienbergspitzen and Wampertem Schrofen. They consist of light-coloured limestone interbedded with argillites.|$|R
500|$|The {{building}} has an irregular trapezoidal footprint corresponding {{to that of}} the group of buildings that formerly occupied the site presenting some difficulties in symmetry. It was also originally enclosed by other buildings, so Hoffmann's design emphasizes its appearance from close by rather than from a distance. The facades, executed in grey <b>muschelkalk,</b> are articulated with reference to the principles of Palladian architecture and based on the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza. A rusticated plinth comprising the first floor and half the height of the mezzanine is surmounted by columns and pilasters in Tuscan order comprising two and a half stories, above which is a mansard roof. The lack of alignment with the stories is an intentional variation from the model. The facades facing the Jüdenstraße, Klosterstraße, Parochialstraße and Stralauer Straße are , , [...] and [...] long, respectively. The main entrances are in the centre of projecting bays on the Jüdenstraße (front) and Klosterstraße (rear) facades, with the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] on the axis between them. The side wings forming the facades on the Parochialstraße and Stralauer Straße sides terminate in projecting bays at the ends of these two primary facades. Cross wings and an opening in the main axis between the vestibule on the rear, Klosterstraße side and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] create five courtyards within the building. The vestibules at the main, Judenstraße entrance and the rear entrance on Klosterstraße are lined with the same stone as the exterior to create a sense that the grand public rooms were also part of the city outside; in the latter, Hoffmann placed a large wall fountain also of Verona marble.|$|E
2500|$|The Triassic Period (251Ma – 205Ma) {{is part of}} the Mesozoic Era (251Ma – 65Ma) and is {{so called}} from its former {{threefold}} division in its type locality in Germany. The divisions have been revised in nomenclature so that they do not correspond with most of the older literature. The onshore Triassic in Britain differs from that in the southern North Sea, Germany and other parts of northern Europe, in not being the classic tripartite lithostratigraphic subdivision; The Triassic deposits of Germany form three series. In the Bunter (meaning 'brightly coloured') series, the land was emergent and red sandstone and sandy shales, with some salt and gypsum, were deposited. The <b>Muschelkalk</b> series saw the transgression of the land by the sea and the deposition of marine shale and limestone; the Keuper series saw the land again emergent and shale, sandstone, and gypsum being formed. Instead, the British Triassic is divided [...] into the Sherwood Sandstone Group, the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group (previously described by their quasi Germanic names, the Bunter and the Keuper) and the Penarth Group [...] these together attain a maximum thickness of ca. 3.5km in the Cheshire Basin.. In Britain the middle division of marine beds is largely absent, giving the original twofold division into Keuper and Bunter, which whilst recognizable as lithological or facies divisions, they are not equivalent to the strata in Germany. The absence of the middle facies, the <b>Muschelkalk,</b> does not mean that <b>Muschelkalk</b> beds of the middle Triassic are absent, but rather that the deposition was continental over this area and not marine as over northern and central Europe. Dating is therefore difficult as there are no fossils and there was no igneous activity, which could have led to the emplacement of isotopes enabling dating. Recent work has shown that the Mercia Mudstones are more complex than originally thought and there are now proposals to give new stratigraphic names to four of the formations.|$|E

2500|$|As {{uncertain}} as {{the exact}} dating {{of the lower}} jaw of Mauer was until recently, so is the assignment of other fossils to its layer. Such contextual fossils are the only direct evidence for an accurate reconstruction of the habitat of a find. Not until 1991 two sets of core drilling were conducted in the defunct sand mine of Grafenrain [...] and - beginning in 1995, several dozen cubic meters of sand were screened in search of fossil fragments that could shed light on accompanying species. However, mice teeth that were found proved to be not suitable for a more precise dating of the layer, since these mice lived anatomically virtually unchanged over too long a period. At least palynological findings of similar vegetation areas of the Cromer interglacial period can help {{with a description of}} the habitat.: [...] "across alluvial forests in the river valleys, forests on the slopes and open forests on the heights; these were rather dry locations, regarding the hydro-geology of the crevasses (...) of the Buntsandstein - and <b>Muschelkalk</b> mountains, bare of any Loess sediments." ...|$|E
60|$|It is reasonable, {{therefore}}, to suppose, {{that the}} Bunter in England was dry land, and therefore safe from fresh deposit, through ages during {{which it was}} deep enough beneath the sea in Germany, to have the <b>Muschelkalk</b> laid down on it. Here again, then, as everywhere, we have evidence of time--time, not only beyond all counting, but beyond all imagining.|$|E
6000|$|Not here, but in Germany. There, {{between the}} Keuper above and the Bunter below, lies a great series of {{limestone}} beds, which, from {{the abundance of}} fossils which they contain, go {{by the name of}} <b>Muschelkalk.</b> A long epoch must therefore have intervened between the laying down of the Bunter and of the Keuper. And we have a trace of that long epoch, even in England. The Keuper lies, certainly, immediately on the Bunter; but not always [...] "conformably" [...] on it. That is, the beds are not exactly parallel. The Bunter had been slightly tilted, and slightly waterworn, before the Keuper was laid on it.|$|E
6000|$|These breaks are {{supposed}} to imply actual new creations {{on the surface of}} our planet--supposed not by Hugh Miller only, but by the majority of geologists. And the terms Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic, are used to indicate these three successive systems of life. It is true that some accept this belief with caution; knowing how geologic research has been all along tending to fill up what were once thought wide gaps. Sir Charles Lyell points out that [...] "the hiatus which exists in Great Britain between the fossils of the Lias and those of the Magnesian Limestone, is supplied in Germany by the rich fauna and flora of the <b>Muschelkalk,</b> Keuper, and Bunter Sandstein, which we know to be of a date precisely intermediate." [...] Again he remarks that [...] "until lately the fossils of the coal-measures were separated from those of the antecedent Silurian group by a very abrupt and decided line of demarcation; but recent discoveries have brought to light in Devonshire, Belgium, the Eifel, and Westphalia, the remains of a fauna of an intervening period." [...] And once more, he says, [...] "we have also in like manner had some success of late years in diminishing the hiatus which still separates the Cretaceous and Eocene periods in Europe." [...] To which let us add that, since Hugh Miller penned the passage above quoted, the second of the great gaps he refers to has been very considerably narrowed by the discovery of strata containing Palæozoic genera and Mesozoic genera intermingled. Nevertheless, the occurrence of two great revolutions in the Earth's Flora and Fauna appears still to be held by many; and geologic nomenclature habitually assumes it.|$|E

The Thuringian Basin belongs to the triassic period, during which horizontal beds of Bunter sandstone, <b>Muschelkalk</b> and Keuper were laid down.

50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the Göttingen Forest area is mainly {{made up of}} layers of middle Triassic <b>Muschelkalk.</b> In the incisions made by the Lutter and Braten valleys there are {{deposits}} from the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. The largest and highest-lying part of the forest, namely the plateau-like areas of the northern Plessforst from the Hünstollen to Plesse Castle and the eastern part from the Lengderburg in the south via the Mackenröder Spitze to the Södderich, are characterised by layers of Lower <b>Muschelkalk,</b> whilst Trochitenkalk and Ceratite layers of the Upper <b>Muschelkalk</b> are the predominant formations found in the central and {{western part of the}} forest that has undergone greater movement. Middle <b>Muschelkalk</b> is found in the transition areas. In the Lange Nacht region and the adjacent slopes of the Kleper there is an elongated trough of upper Triassic Keuper, and individual pockets of the Lower Keuper are also found {{in the southern part of}} the Göttingen Forest. To the north, east and south, regions of sandstone border on the forest. In the west there are Pleistocene silts and finally the Holocene water meadow loam of the Leine valley. Many old quarries are located in the Trochitenkalk and Lower <b>Muschelkalk</b> in which limestone, the main building material for nearby settlements, was obtained. By contrast, the more thinly bedded and very brittle layers were just used as hard core for road building or to reinforce dirt tracks. The limestone areas of the Lower and Upper <b>Muschelkalk</b> are mostly covered with just a thin layer of humus which, even when weathered, do not support very fertile agricultural soils. Settlements were therefore established almost entirely in the areas where Middle <b>Muschelkalk</b> occurs which is also where several small springs rise.|$|E
