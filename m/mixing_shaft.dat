The traditional type of pre-mixer is a trough with a cylindrical section inside which rotates a <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft</b> with blades. More advanced systems use a high-speed (centrifuge) pre-mixer in which water and semolina are sprayed into the chamber, so that each particle of semolina absorbs the correct amount of water.|$|E
40|$|Soil mixing is a {{well-established}} technology {{used in the}} improvement of the strength of soil as well as the remediation of chemical contaminants in soil. This process is typically referred to as in situ solidification/stabilization (S/S). In situ S/S involves mixing a binding reagent into the contaminated media or waste using soil augers and has been used to treat both organic and inorganic hazardous waste constituents. Cement-based mix designs are most commonly used for S/S treatment of hazardous waste, however, a variety of additives such as fly ash, hydrated lime, bentonite can also used to meet specific project requirements. Several technologies can be used for the in situ S/S of soils, however, a specific focus will be placed {{on the use of the}} Shallow Soil Mixing (SSM) technique. SSM consists of using a single large diameter auger, generally on the range of 5 to 10 ft in diameter, capable of mixing to depths up to 30 or 40 feet deep. The <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft,</b> known as the kelly bar, is hollow stemmed and is attached to a single flight auger which breaks the soil loose and lifts it slightly to six beater bars on the <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft.</b> As the auger penetrates the soil, a slurried reagent is pumped through the <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft</b> and exits through jets located on th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the effect of {{vibrating}} mixing technology in industrial production of concrete, the influence of vibrating mixing and common forced mixing on the mixing quality and efficiency were comparatively investigated by field tests of concrete mixing plant. The vibrating mixing scheme was achieved by adopting <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft</b> and blades as vibrating source based on conventional twin-shaft mixer. The field tests included mixing time test and reducing cement test. The experimental results show that under different mixing time, the freshly mixed concrete by both mixing methods have similar uniformity but the hardened concrete have distinctive compression strength; comparing with common forced mixing, vibrating mixing makes the materials in vibrating status to destroy their sticky connection and distribute cement particles, so both 7 d and 28 d compression strength are significantly improved and the mixing time is reduced; with the cement reduction, the compression strength of concrete by both mixing methods decrease, but comparing with common forced mixing, vibrating mixing can save cement under the condition of ensuring necessary concrete strength due to its improved cement utilization...|$|E
2500|$|The final mixer is a trough with shafts {{which are}} {{equipped}} with <b>mixing</b> blades. Both <b>shafts</b> and blades are made of stainless steel. The shafts run at a low speed (70 rpm) to mix the raw ingredients into a dough. This process usually takes 10-20 minutes.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} by batch cold-mix technique of foam bitumen-based bound graded aggregates is studied at laboratory scale. The influence of some mixing parameters (mixing system, <b>mixing</b> time, <b>shaft</b> speed, aggregates temperature and foam characteristics) and bitumen content is analyzed. An original developed test permits {{a measure of}} the mixture microstructure. A twin-shaft mixer gives better results than a planetary mixer. The mixture temperature during mixing, resulting from aggregates and foam temperatures, seems being the most influent mixing parameter. It favours the dispersion of bitumen in smaller particles of mastic. It is shown that cohesion of compacted material, measured by direct compression test, is highly dependent on the grading of mastic particle before compaction...|$|R
50|$|Of {{the solid}} colours, sable is {{considered}} rare, and is classified by some countries {{as being a}} type of particolour on account of its <b>mixed</b> hair <b>shafts.</b> White is black/brown pigmentation is also considered rare, and is also usually classified as a particolour too. In addition a silver/ash colour, usually associated with the Weimaraner breed of dog, is considered genetically possible but {{is yet to be}} recorded by the United Kingdom's Kennel Club. Of the roan varieties, lemon roan with a light brown pigmentation is the most recessive of all the roans. Plain white Cockers are rarely born, and are thought to be more prone to deafness than those with more pigmentation. As such they are generally not encouraged in the breed.|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptualized}} impeller called KIA {{is designed}} for impact agitation of food waste in a homogenizer. A comparative analysis {{of the performance of}} KIA is made with three conventional impeller types, Rushton, Anchor, and Pitched Blade. Solid–liquid mixing of a moisture-rich food waste is simulated under various operational speeds, in order to compare the dispersions and thermal distributions at homogenous slurry conditions. Using SolidWorks, the design of the impellers employs an Application Programming Interface (API) which acts as the canvas for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for automation of its assembly. A parametric analysis of the homogenizer, at varying operational speeds, enables the estimation of the critical speed of the <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft</b> diameter and the deflection under numerous mixing conditions and impeller configurations. The numerical simulation of the moisture-rich food waste (approximated as a Newtonian carrot–orange soup) is performed with ANSYS CFX v. 15. 0. The velocity and temperature field distribution of the homogenizer for various impeller rotational speeds are analyzed. It is anticipated that the developed model will help in the selection of a suitable impeller for efficient mixing of food waste in the homogenizer...|$|E
30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a liquid charge system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The liquid charging system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The liquid charge could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a pump, bottom valve, drain trough and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The bottom valve was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The drain trough was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 ″ internal diameter, 10 ″ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A ¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the <b>mixing</b> <b>shaft</b> from 0 to 1900  rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two ¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume. A detailed description of the design, mathematical models, and calibration for this mixer-viscometer is published elsewhere (Bbosa 2015; Bbosa et al. 2017) Fig.  8 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the setup. Figure  9 shows the schematic of the in-house mixer-viscometer used in characterization of hydrate slurries. Figure  10 shows the small-scale facility setup.|$|E
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common <b>shaft.</b> <b>Mixing</b> of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|R
50|$|There {{were eight}} {{different}} colored tops to choose from, although as noted only four could battle at one time. The tops were composed of octagonal discs slipped over a ridged shaft {{that had a}} notch to engage the string. The game came with a sheet of coloured stickers to place on the discs. Ostensibly the stickers were to match the colour of the disc and the shaft, but {{it was possible to}} <b>mix</b> and match <b>shafts,</b> discs, and stickers (with the proviso that the stickers only stuck once). In the new version of the game, Smarty Smitty has been replaced by Cyclone Steve. In the 1968 version there was an 8 top version that included Fighting Frank and Rocky Rocko. The six player sets had red, yellow, green, light blue, white, and orange. Some sets have rarer colors. There is a 1986 version with a red arena that included 8 tops.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{is motivated by}} the widespread loss of life and property due to accidental fires in high rise buildings, and investigates the progress of hot, toxic, products during such fires. The Stack Effect and Turbulent Mixing, two of the primary factors responsible for smoke movement within tall buildings {{are the focus of}} this study. The results of this investigation could be used for the development of fire modeling codes that simulate high-rise building fires. The experiments involve a 2. 6 m tall square shaft with various cross sections and openings. The shaft was situated above a large temperature controlled hot air reservoir, and the two chambers were initially separated by a partition. At the start of the experiment the partition was removed in a rapid horizontal motion and the hot and cold gases were allowed to <b>mix.</b> For the <b>shafts</b> with openings, the gases were withdrawn from the apertures at different rates with the Reynolds number varying between 600 and 7200. The temperature of the gas and wall, and the heat transfer to the wall were measured as functions of time at various locations in the shaft. Additionally, hot wire anemometry techniques were used to obtain velocity data in the channel. Some experiments involved monitoring a tracer gas in the vertical channel. Simple one-dimensional analytical modeling was performed to validate the experimental results. The experiments indicated an initial transient period followed by a "pseudo steady state. " At each elevation measured the cross-section averaged gas temperature, reached and fluctuated about a steady state value soon after the initial front of hot gas arrived at that location. For the closed channel experiments, the front arrival time was a function of the initial density ratio, the shaft width, and the gravitational constant. The tracer gas trials suggested that the molecular diffusion was insignificant in comparison to the turbulent mixing. For the closed channels the observed velocity fluctuations were the same order of magnitude as the mean velocities. The time averaged heat transfer coefficient was weakly dependent on the initial reservoir temperature. The vented shaft experiments indicated that the front propagation times are significantly affected by openings in the shaft and that the effect is more pronounced the higher the vents are located. The venting caused a significant rise in the steady state temperatures, and a reduction in both the temperature and velocity fluctuations. The local Nusselt number was independent of the Reynolds number and a function only of the Rayleigh number, indicating that the heat transfer was dominated by free convection effects. The predictions made by the one dimensional analytical model agreed reasonably well with the experiments, particularly {{in the case of the}} closed channel...|$|R
