The TEOMs often under-reported particulate matter measurements by 50%. A process of colocation and auditing of operations will allow reliance on the new and higher readings.

25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal <b>microbalance</b> and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|E
500|$|Du Noüy–Padday method: A {{minimized}} {{version of}} Du Noüy method uses a small diameter metal needle {{instead of a}} ring, in combination with a high sensitivity <b>microbalance</b> to record maximum pull. The advantage of this method is that very small sample volumes (down to few tens of microliters) can be measured with very high precision, without the need to correct for buoyancy (for a needle or rather, rod, with proper geometry). Further, the measurement can be performed very quickly, minimally in about 20 seconds. First commercial multichannel tensiometers [...] were recently built based on this principle.|$|E
40|$|To some degree, all current {{models of}} visual motion-perception {{mechanisms}} {{depend on the}} power of the visual signal in various spatiotemporal-frequency bands. Here we show how to construct counterexamples: visual stimuli that are consistently perceived as obviously moving in a fixed direction yet for which Fourier-domain power analysis yields no systematic motion components in any given direction. We provide a general theoretical framework for investigating non-Fourier motion-perception mechanisms; central are the concepts of drift-balanced and <b>microbalanced</b> random stimuli. A random stimulus S is drift balanced if its expected power in the frequency domain is symmetric with respect to temporal frequency, that is, if the expected power in S of every drifting sinusoidal component is equal to the expected power of the sinusoid of the same spatial frequency, drifting at the same rate in the opposite direction. Additionally, S is <b>microbalanced</b> if the result WS of windowing S by any spacetime-separable function W is drift balanced. We prove that (i) any space-time-separable random (or nonrandom) stimulus is microbalanced; (ii) any linear combination of pairwise independent <b>microbalanced</b> (respectively, driftbalanced) random stimuli is <b>microbalanced</b> and drift balanced if the expectation of each component is uniformly zero; (iii) the convolution of independent <b>microbalanced</b> and drift-balanced random stimuli is <b>microbalanced</b> and drift balanced; (iv) the product of independent <b>microbalanced</b> random stimuli is microbalanced; and (v) the expected response of any Reichardt detector to any <b>microbalanced</b> random stimulus is zero at every instant in time. Examples are provided of classes of <b>microbalanced</b> random stimuli that display consistent and compelling motion in one direction. All the results and examples from the domain of motion perception are transposable to the spacedomain problem of detecting orientation in a texture pattern. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Physicist Robert L. Park {{has found}} it {{suspicious}} that a phenomenon should only ever appear at the limits of detectability of questionable statistical techniques. He cites this feature as one of Irving Langmuir's indicators of pathological science. Park pointed out that if mind really could influence matter, {{it would be easy}} for parapsychologists to measure such a phenomenon by using the alleged psychokinetic power to deflect a <b>microbalance,</b> which would not require any dubious statistics. [...] "he reason, of course, is that the <b>microbalance</b> stubbornly refuses to budge." [...] He has suggested that the reason statistical studies are so popular in parapsychology is that they introduce opportunities for uncertainty and error, which are used to support the experimenter's biases.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} {{mass of the}} MOF due to the stored {{hydrogen is}} directly calculated by a highly sensitive <b>microbalance.</b> Due to buoyancy, the detected mass of adsorbed hydrogen decreases again when a sufficiently high pressure {{is applied to the}} system because the density of the surrounding gaseous hydrogen becomes more and more important at higher pressures. Thus, this [...] "weight loss" [...] has to be corrected using the volume of the MOF’s frame and the density of hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|The {{class of}} <b>microbalanced</b> motion stimuli {{is thought to}} contain no {{systematic}} directional biases in motion energy.

The validity of one widely studied class of <b>microbalanced</b> stimuli, contrast modulated noise, has recently been questioned. It has been proposed that stochastic local biases in the noise carrier give rise to luminance artifacts detectable by a Fourier energy mechanism.

We conclude that this class of stimuli remains an important tool for researchers wishing to study non-Fourier motion...|$|R
