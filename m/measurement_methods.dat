40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} effect of maxillary {{expansion}} on orthodontics. MethodsEight beagle dogs were randomly divided into two groups, with 4 dogs in each group. Dogs in group 1 were executed immediately and received the direct physical measurement. The magnetic expansion appliance was used in group 2 for the maxillary expansion. After the expansion, the model was taken again and they were executed after cone beam CT (CBCT) scanning. The model <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> was adopted in group 1 to measure the dental measurement indicators and width of base bone arch. The CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> was employed to measure the above dental indicators and bone indicators. The difference in the indicators measured by different methods was compared and analyzed. ResultsBefore the expansion, {{there was no significant}} difference in the bone measurement indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> After the expansion, {{there was no significant difference}} in indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical measurement. But there was significant difference among the model <b>measurement</b> <b>method,</b> CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> There was the significant difference in the dental indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and model <b>measurement,</b> as well as the bone indicators of posterior marginal spacing of greater palatine foramen, posterior marginal spacing of incisive foramen, width of base bone arch and spacing of implant anchorage.

Assessing body {{composition}} {{is important to}} provide information about nutritional status and health risks. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if there is a significant difference in {{body composition}} depending on <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and if the discrepancy in <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> is greater for amputees than for non-amputees. Methods: 23 subjects (12 lower limb amputees and 11 non-amputees) were matched based on sex, age, height, weight, ethnicity, and self-reported activity level. Subject’s body composition was assessed through Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) using a Lunar Prodigy whole body scanner (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI), Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA) using an OMRON (Bannockburn, IL) hand-held body fat analyzer, and the Skinfold Technique with calipers from Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc. (Cambridge, Maryland). Results: 2 -way ANOVA for % body fat by <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and percent body fatness showed a main effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> (p= 0. 02). Post hoc showed significant difference between BIA & DEXA (p= 0. 01). There was no interaction effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and body fatness (average vs. above average) p= 0. 77. 2 way ANOVA for % body fat by <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and type of individual (amputee vs. non-amputee) showed a main effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> (p= 0. 03). Post hoc showed significant difference between BIA & DEXA (p= 0. 04). There was no interaction effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and type of individual (p= 0. 70). Conclusions: There is a significant difference in body composition depending on <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> There is a trend for body composition to differ more by method for subjects with above average % body fat than for subjects with average % body fat. Likewise, there is a trend for body composition to differ more by method for amputees than for non-amputees...|$|R

Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these <b>measurement</b> <b>methods</b> has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales.

25|$|Most {{ingested}} cholesterol is esterified, and esterified cholesterol {{is poorly}} absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis. For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if {{any effect on}} concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase. It {{is also important to}} recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the <b>measurement</b> <b>methods</b> used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.|$|E

She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or <b>measurement</b> <b>methods)</b> and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire.

2500|$|According to Schmidt and Hunter, [...] "for hiring {{employees}} without {{previous experience}} in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability." [...] The validity of IQ {{as a predictor of}} job performance is above zero for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. The correlations were higher when the unreliability of <b>measurement</b> <b>methods</b> was controlled for. While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function, IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations. That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores {{are more likely to be}} a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance. The prevailing view among academics is that it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance. This view has been challenged by Byington & Felps (2010), who argued that [...] "the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better." ...|$|E
