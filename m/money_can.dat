5|$|Combat is {{staged in}} a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a {{combination}} of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes. At the end of combat, money (as yen) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The <b>money</b> <b>can</b> be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests. The <b>money</b> <b>can</b> also be used to buy new combat techniques at dojos throughout the land.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 6 {{looks at}} {{solutions}} to the problem. Cowen praises the development of India and China as producers and consumers, {{the role of the}} internet in enlarging the scientific community, and a growing consensus for the reform of educational policy in the US. He further suggests for the social status of scientists to be raised to at least as strong a motivating factor as <b>money</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent <b>money</b> <b>can</b> then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set in the fictional town of Black Rock. The player takes {{on the role of}} Sheriff Quickdraw, and the main objective of the game is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town. The game begins with a first-person perspective targeting minigame in which vertically scrolling bags of <b>money</b> <b>can</b> be shot at using crosshairs. Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase ammunition.|$|E
5|$|With many 9th century Tang era merchants {{avoiding}} {{the weight and}} bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading receipts from deposit shops where goods or money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive receipts that could be cashed {{in a number of}} nearby towns by accredited persons. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade. China's first official regional paper-printed <b>money</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to the}} year 1024, in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game <b>money</b> <b>can</b> be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
25|$|The President, {{while having}} {{to enforce the}} law, also {{possesses}} wide discretion in deciding how and even when to enforce laws. He also has a range of interpretive discretion in deciding the meaning of laws he must execute.

5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this <b>money</b> <b>can</b> be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately demand {{fuels the}} market for these {{precious}} woods. Most of the blame rests with the Chinese and Westerners, who unknowingly prop up this high-priced market through their demand for high-class furniture and musical instruments made from rosewood or ebony. Therefore, the solution lies in public education to help control demand and teach people how their <b>money</b> <b>can</b> indirectly support these illegal activities by providing revenue to companies that directly support them through investment.|$|E

50|$|In {{looking at}} {{internal}} {{as well as}} external assets, remember the fundamental rule of clandestine operations: the more secure, the less efficient.

25|$|In October 2008, McCain {{proposed}} {{that the federal government}} buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners.

McCain also proposed to cut the capital gains tax on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses.|$|E
25|$|Game {{publishers}} usually {{prohibit the}} exchange of real-world money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In Second Life and Entropia Universe, the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real <b>money</b> <b>can</b> be deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in Entropia, and some players of Second Life have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.|$|E

40|$|A {{monetary}} {{model of}} heterogeneous households is constructed which deals in a tractable {{way with the}} distribution of money balances across the population. Only some households are {{on the receiving end}} of a money injection from the central bank, and this in general produces price dispersion across markets. This price dispersion generates uninsured consumption risk which is important in determining the effects of money growth, optimal policy, and the effects of money growth shocks. The optimal <b>money</b> growth rate <b>can</b> be very close to zero, and the welfare cost of small inflations can be very large. Small <b>money</b> shocks <b>can</b> have important sectoral effects with small effects on aggregates, while large <b>money</b> shocks <b>can</b> have proportionately large effects on aggregates. ...|$|R
