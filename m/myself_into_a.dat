25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
500|$|Van Peebles {{stated that}} he {{approached}} directing the film [...] "like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope {{to come out on}} top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing." [...] Van Peebles stated that [...] "story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. [...] To avoid putting <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation {{opened at}} the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured {{to be able to}} attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the [...] "right parts and the right movies." [...] Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. [...] "I wanted to start off small and to learn [...] I wouldn't just want to throw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> big part." [...] In August 2006, Canadian Business {{magazine}} ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.|$|E
60|$|I {{led the way}} to {{the lift}} and on to my sitting-room. There I turned up the {{electric}} lights and threw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair.|$|R
60|$|Before {{going to}} bed that night I did not throw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair and gaze musingly out into the night. On the contrary, I stood up sturdily with {{my back to the}} mantel-piece, and with the {{forefinger}} of my right hand I tapped my left palm.|$|R
60|$|Third.--I {{resolved}} {{completely to}} govern my outward manner and suppress indignation. To do this, I must govern my spirit. To do that, {{by force of}} imagination I was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> unnatural mental state and see all things {{through the eyes of}} an assumed character.|$|R
500|$|Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, an {{electrical}} lineman in Indiana who encounters and forms {{an obsession with}} unidentified flying objects. Steve McQueen was Spielberg's first choice. Although McQueen {{was impressed with the}} script, he felt he was not right for the role as he was unable to cry on cue. Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Gene Hackman turned down the part as well. Jack Nicholson turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained when filming Jaws, [...] "Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155 days' worth of Close Encounters. He even contributed ideas." [...] Dreyfuss reflected, [...] "I launched <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> campaign to get the part. I would walk by Steve's office and say stuff like 'Al Pacino has no sense of humor' or 'Jack Nicholson is too crazy'. I eventually convinced him to cast me." ...|$|E
60|$|Five o'clock.--I have {{effected}} a masterly compromise; I {{have decided}} on turning <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Jack-o n-both-sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{have put}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> groove, and ground <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mould, and clipped and pared and pinched myself all round,--very ineffectually, as I fear,--to fit myself for this thing. You have lived as free as air. You have disdained,--and though I may have grumbled I have still been proud {{to see you}} disdain,--to wrap {{yourself}} in the swaddling bandages of Court life. You have ridiculed all {{those who have been}} near her Majesty as Court ladies." ...|$|E
60|$|Ransome {{gave me one}} of his attractive, intelligent, quick glances {{and went}} away with the tray. It {{occurred}} to me that I had been talking somewhat in Mr. Burns' manner. It annoyed me. Yet often in darker moments I forgot <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest against a living enemy.|$|R
6000|$|Alvar. [...] She {{would have}} died [...] Died in her guilt--perchance by her own hands! [...] 315 [...] And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds, [...] I might have met the evil glance of frenzy, [...] And leapt <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> unblest grave! [...] I prayed for the {{punishment}} that cleanses hearts: [...] For still I loved her! ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{up in my}} perch, I <b>myself</b> broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{laugh at}} that I saw.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sammy,' said Mr. Weller, {{wiping his}} forehead, 'I'm afeerd that vun o' these days I shall laugh <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> appleplexy, my boy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tired so soon, Babie? Or in a pet because I cannot change <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> thistledown {{and float}} about with you, like Manuel and Pauline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{consequences}} {{will be that}} I {{will form}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> court-martial, find you guilty of desertion, and shoot you down where you stand. Come, do those belts go down or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Albert (his voice trembling, and in {{tones of}} deep distress). She [...] would have died, [...] Died in her sins--perchance, {{by her own}} hands! [...] And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds [...] 325 [...] I might have met the evil glance of frenzy [...] And leapt <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> unblest grave! [...] I pray'd for the {{punishment}} that cleanses hearts, [...] For still I loved her! ...|$|R
60|$|And then I put {{the lid on}} it. With {{the best}} {{intentions}} in the world I got <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> mess that I thought the end had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child, certainly. I can't throw <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> object so {{completely}} without expense. You forget, {{or perhaps you}} don't know, that under either of the wills Ada and I take something. It's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller. I shall be within the mark any way. Bless your heart, my excellent girl," [...] said Richard, quite amused with me, [...] "I shall be all right! I shall pull through, my dear!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, all right, then,' said he; 'to-morrow I {{will change}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> serpent, and hide {{myself in the}} date barrel; and {{when he comes to}} fetch dates I will sting him in the hand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{he can do}} that," [...] said he, [...] "I will {{transform}} <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lion and tear him to pieces, or into a bear and eat him up, or into a fly and fly away where {{he could not find}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old soul, I'll be good by-and-by, but now I'm {{tired and}} cross, {{so let me}} keep out of every one's way and drowse <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cheerier frame of mind. I want nothing but solitude, a draught of water, and a kiss." ...|$|E
60|$|Flora choked down a cry. I {{recovered}} <b>myself,</b> dropped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> heap of rugs on {{the seat}} facing the ladies, and pulled-to the door by its strap.|$|R
5000|$|The extant Egyptian-Greek texts dwell {{upon the}} oneness and {{goodness}} of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices, {{such as the}} veneration of images. Their concerns are practical in nature, their end is a spiritual rebirth through the enlightenment of the mind:Seeing within myself an immaterial vision {{that came from the}} mercy of God, I went out of <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> immortal body, and now I am not what I was before. I have been born in mind! ...|$|R
2500|$|Mandisa won the Best Contemporary Christian Music Album for Overcomer at the 56th Grammy Awards. The title {{song from}} the album also won Best Contemporary Christian Music Song for songwriters David Garcia, Ben Glover and Christopher Stevens. She {{declined}} to attend the Grammy Awards, however, saying, [...] "I have fallen prey to the alluring pull of flesh, pride, and selfish desires quite a bit recently. I knew that submerging <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> environment that celebrates those things was risky for me at this time.|$|R
60|$|I {{wandered into}} the dining-room, wedged <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> screwed chair, and fell asleep, my head on my arms, my arms on the table. And at quarter past seven the steward roused me by shaking my shoulders. It was time to set table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nine o'clock," [...] his hostess said. [...] "I {{could not}} come before, for I have had several parties going past, {{and the house was}} searched once. I kept on {{wondering}} whether you wanted me, until I nearly worked <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{have never}} heard me read yet. I have been twice goaded and lifted out of <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> state that {{astonished}} me {{almost as much as}} the audience. I have a cold, but no neuralgia, and am [...] "as well as can be expected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simpson {{then made}} his second double-century {{in as many}} innings, posting 230 not out in an innings win against Queensland, more than 57% of his team's runs. His innings of 79 in the draw against South Australia was his lowest score {{of the season and}} ended the summer with 98 and 161 not out against New South Wales, {{carrying}} his bat in the second innings of a defeat and again scoring the majority of his state's runs for the match. Simpson reflected that [...] "I spent two years turning <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> overnight success." ...|$|R
60|$|I found <b>myself</b> looking <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bright brown {{eye that}} gleamed with genial triumph. The other was closed. In the {{exuberance}} of the moment, Smooth Sam {{had had the}} bad taste to wink at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{something}} about general fairness--the other side," [...] prompted Parvill, flattered {{but a little}} surprised by my appeal. I pulled <b>myself</b> hastily <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my opponent's good taste.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Plainly I {{see that}} you have not done as I bid you, nor will you ever do it,' spoke Gille Mairtean the fox; 'but I will help you yet again {{for a third time}} I will change <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ship, and we will sail to France.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{and again}} at short {{intervals}} I ascended the ladder, peering through the crevices of the shutters to learn how near to setting the sun might be, and thus succeeded in so working <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fever of anxiety and fear as to be like one who has lost his senses.|$|E
60|$|By this {{dwelling}} {{upon the}} possibilities I soon worked <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> most cowardly frame of mind, from which I did not awaken {{until we were}} come to {{a long stretch of}} sandy land either side of the river, where there was no fear our enemies could find a hiding-place.|$|E
60|$|I was {{deliberately}} striving to work <b>myself</b> up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fury that I might strike the cur senseless with a blow, taking {{the chance of}} killing him, for as the seconds sped I realized how great was our danger unless his tongue could be silenced.|$|R
60|$|When {{the king}} first {{expressed}} his wish to me, I made known to him my utter abhorrence of the measure, and worked <b>myself</b> <b>into</b> such <b>a</b> state of excitement, that he absolutely {{stared at me}} in amazement. It evidently surpassed his majesty’s comprehension how any sober-minded and sensible individual could entertain the least possible objection to so beautifying an operation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have allowed}} <b>myself</b> to fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> weak state," [...] {{continued}} Sir Thomas, speaking slowly, [...] "while by proper exertion I might have avoided it." ...|$|R
