2500|$|The Byzantine army {{marched to}} the north but did not take any actions to take back Mesembria. On 4 May there was a solar eclipse which frightened the Byzantine {{soldiers}} and lowered their morale. They encamped {{in the vicinity of}} Adrianople where the army looted and robbed its own country. In May Khan Krum also headed to Adrianople. In June both armies set their camps close to each other near the small fortress of Versinikia to the north of Adrianople. John Skylitzes in Synopsis Historion, stated that the Byzantine army was 10 times (some historians stated even 20 times) bigger than the Bulgarian hosts. That was probably overestimated but undoubtedly the Byzantine army was significantly larger than the Bulgarian. Therefore, the Bulgarians kept on a defensive position. Despite the numerical, logistic and strategic superiority the Byzantine army did not confront the adversary. Both armies became tense and anxious, having waited for thirteen days in the hot summer of Thrace, while wearing full armor. At the end the Byzantine commanders failed the test of nerve and stamina. Some of them were eager to attack and on 22 June the strategos of Macedonia John Aplakes addressed Michael and said: [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> we going to wait and die? I will attack first in the name of God and you will follow me bravely. And victory shall be ours because we are ten times more than them [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty <b>much</b> <b>are</b> getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
