5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> {{of the feet}} of what is {{currently}} the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} Silent Hill 2 is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> {{that he is}} facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, {{which can only be}} read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E

25|$|A charged {{particle}} <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> {{perpendicular to the}} magnetic field line {{is subject to the}} Lorentz force which is normal to the plane individuated by the velocity and the magnetic field. This force bends the path of the particle. In general, since particles also have a velocity component along the magnetic field line, the Lorentz force constrains them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the cyclotron frequency.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} charge {{carriers}} are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron. The movement {{of any of}} these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the conventional current without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.|$|E

25|$|Apparent superluminal {{motion is}} {{observed}} in many radio galaxies, blazars, quasars and recently also in microquasars. The effect was predicted {{before it was}} observed by Martin Rees and can be explained as an optical illusion caused by the object partly <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the observer, when the speed calculations assume it does not. The phenomenon does not contradict the theory of special relativity. Corrected calculations show these objects have velocities close to {{the speed of light}} (relative to our reference frame). They are the first examples of large amounts of mass moving at close to the speed of light. Earth-bound laboratories have only been able to accelerate small numbers of elementary particles to such speeds.|$|E
25|$|President Lincoln {{reacted to}} McClellan's failure by {{appointing}} John Pope {{to command the}} newly formed Army of Virginia. Pope had achieved some success in the Western Theater, and Lincoln sought a more aggressive general than McClellan. The Army of Virginia consisted of over 50,000 men in three corps. Three corps of McClellan's Army of the Potomac later were added for combat operations. Two cavalry brigades were attached directly {{to two of the}} infantry corps, which presented a lack of centralized control that had negative effects in the campaign. Pope's mission was to fulfill two objectives: protect Washington and the Shenandoah Valley, and draw Confederate forces away from McClellan by <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Gordonsville. Pope started on the latter by dispatching cavalry to break the railroad connecting Gordonsville, Charlottesville, and Lynchburg. The cavalry got {{off to a slow start}} and found that Stonewall Jackson had occupied Gordonsville with over 14,000 men.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of Operation Bagration, on June 22, the 334th and its Corps {{were part of the}} assault forces of 43rd Army. Following a very heavy {{artillery}} barrage and air attacks, 60 Corps had passed through both the first and second German defense lines and reached the Obol River. By the evening of June 23, 60th Corps was pressing remnants of German Corps Detachment D south towards the Dvina River west of Vitebsk. On the following day several bridgeheads were taken, and crossing operations began on both sides of Beshenkovichi. Overnight on June 25/26 60th Corps met the 19th Guards Rifle Division of 39th Army at Gnezdilovichi, closing the ring, and through the day forces of both armies cleared Vitebsk. On the same date the division was recognized for its role in liberating the city, towards which the Red Army had struggled for so many months, and was given that name as an honorific:Following this victory the division joined in the pursuit of the broken remnants of Army Group Center, and by the second week in July had nearly reached the Lithuanian border just east of Švenčionys. Over the following months the advance slowed, and by August 1 the division found itself in the vicinity of Kupiškis, <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Riga. Two weeks later it had reached Pasvalys, and shortly thereafter was transferred, {{along with the rest of}} 60 Corps, to 51st Army. By mid-September the 334th had crossed into Latvia at Eleja, but made little further progress over the next six weeks. In the last months of the year the division was briefly reassigned back to 4th Shock Army, then to 61st Army.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} more subtle shifts away from the core {{influences}} of Dungeons & Dragons {{that existed in the}} 1980s and 1990s. Games were originally closely tied to the system's basic mechanics such as dice rolls and turn-based tactical combat, but are now <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of real-time modes, simplified mechanics and skill-based interfaces. Dungeons & Dragons itself is diverging from its roots, as the 4th Edition D rules have been compared to role-playing video games like World of Warcraft and Fire Emblem. Even as some non-role-playing games adopt RPG elements, [...] developers and publishers are concerned that the term [...] "role-playing game" [...] might alienate non-RPG gamers.|$|E
500|$|The Sun orbits {{the center}} of the Milky Way, and it is {{presently}} <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the constellation of Cygnus. The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is [...] roughly elliptical with orbital perturbations due to the non-uniform mass distribution in Milky Way, such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms. In addition, the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. It has been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on Earth, perhaps due to increased impact events. It takes the Solar System about 225–250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a galactic year), so it is thought to have completed 20–25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun. The orbital speed of the Solar System about {{the center of}} the Milky Way is approximately 251km/s (156mi/s). At this speed, it takes around 1,190 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 7 days to travel 1 AU.|$|E
