5|$|Moore {{expressed}} {{hope that}} the film could be shown and released, even if it <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> legal battle.|$|E
5|$|A large {{development}} Planning Association <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> {{great amount}} of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2013 Mark Bedford {{increased}} his performances with the band building to his full-time return to the group, which <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> close to the four years Graham 'Bushers' Bush had spent with the band.|$|E
50|$|At {{that time}} 'a bombing attack' <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> attack using hand grenades.|$|R
50|$|Easy rider {{originally}} <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> expert horseman or a {{horse that}} was easy to ride.|$|R
50|$|Here, {{government}} meant {{someone who}} was working in government sectors, and black <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> average person ("the masses"), quarter or quart <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> area of land that is planted with a quarter of rye. The land was planted {{in such a way}} that the area of land seeded with two quarters was equal to a desyatina (an area of land approximately equal to one hectare).|$|R
5|$|Hambleton had Top Secret {{access to}} Strategic Air Command {{operations}} {{and was an}} expert in surface-to-air missile countermeasures. The North Vietnamese Army may have possessed information about his presence in Vietnam and his capture would have <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> huge intelligence bonanza for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} to stay there. From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Domnall mac Causantín's {{nickname}} was dásachtach. This simply <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> madman, or, {{in early}} Irish law, a man {{not in control}} of his functions and hence without legal culpability. The following long reign (900–942/3) of his successor Causantín is more often regarded {{as the key to}} formation of the Kingdom of Alba.|$|E
5000|$|In section 25 of the Theft Act 1968, {{the word}} [...] "cheat" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> offence under section 15.|$|R
50|$|The many varied {{employment}} opportunities in Skövde have <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> increase in daily commuting {{to the city}} from neighboring municipalities.|$|R
50|$|Upon Mongolia's {{declaration}} of independence, many Chinese became victims of atrocities, particularly in Khovd. However, after 1912, Chinese businesses {{were able to}} continue their operations, including collection of debts, largely unimpeded. It was only the establishment of communism that <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> end to Chinese trade in Mongolia. Ever-increasing obstacles to commerce were created, and {{the closure of the}} border to China for imports in 1928 <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> end for Chinese enterprise in the country.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> wider variety of locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted to steam operations.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God and dread nought. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{is derived}} from the Old English leah which <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> place at the wood or {{woodland}} clearing, a glade and subsequently a pasture or meadow, it was spelt Legh in 1276. Other recorded spellings include Leech, 1264; Leeche, 1268; Leghthe, 1305; Leght, 1417; Lech, 1451; Legh, 16th century. As its name denotes it was a district rich in meadow and pasture land, and the produce of its dairies, the Leigh cheese, was formerly noted for its excellence.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} Elevated {{now instead of}} the Subway. That was {{important}} in her life. It <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> entire change of scenery.|$|R
2500|$|The {{respondent}} {{relied on}} {{the language of the}} statute to argue that [...] "action" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> action in court, not an administrative proceeding.|$|R
50|$|Economically, this <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> {{expansion}} of the money supply. As this would tend towards increasing inflation, Hans Luther agreed to only a small volume.|$|R
5|$|Reaching {{a career}} milestone, Suter played in his 1,000th NHL game on October 25, 2000, scoring a goal in a 3–1 {{victory over the}} Columbus Blue Jackets. He said the {{achievement}} <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lot to him given both the ailments he overcame {{and that he was}} dismissed by critics as unlikely to play in the NHL when he was drafted in 1984. Suter finished the regular season with 34 points, but missed nearly the entire playoffs after suffering a concussion in the Sharks' first post-season game.|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{associations of}} selected nations {{were invited to}} send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until {{two months before the}} start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{closure of}} the {{northern}} section of the line <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> end to over 100 years of railway service {{to the city of}} Ripon.|$|R
50|$|The Ancient Greeks had {{a concept}} of arete which <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> {{outstanding}} fitness for purpose. This occurs {{in the works of}} Aristotle and Homer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{respondent}} {{relied on}} {{the language of the}} statute to argue that [...] "action" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> action in court, not an administrative proceeding.|$|R
5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{building}} land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904, <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> {{reduction in the number}} of residents who might use the station there. Work continued below ground at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
50|$|In {{its last}} season, 1944-45, {{it was meant}} to have nine clubs again but the arrival of the war in Silesia <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> early {{cancellation}} of the competition.|$|R
50|$|Oberschrot {{was created}} as an {{independent}} municipality in 1831. Before that, the name <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> area in the parish of Rechthalten that consisted of four Schrote or village sections.|$|R
5000|$|Menahem Stern {{said that}} Suetonius was {{definitely}} referring to Jesus Christ; {{because he would}} have added [...] "a certain" [...] to Chrestus if he had <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> unknown agitator.|$|R
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drive {{me to the}} Bayswater Road." [...] His old aunts {{had never}} failed him. To them he had <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> everwelcome visitor. Though they were gone, there, still, was Timothy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well I know. They <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> asylum--an IDIOT asylum, do you understand? So they DO think there's {{a pair of}} us, after all. Now what do {{you think}} of yourself?" ...|$|R
50|$|Mirabeau (in Provençal Mirabèu) {{comes from}} mirar (to see) and bel (beautiful). In the 12th century, Mirabel or Mirabellum <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> {{elevated}} place {{from where you}} can see a long way.|$|R
