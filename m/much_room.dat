5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too <b>much</b> <b>room</b> to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E

25|$|Besides that, Article 12 of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive {{concerning}} the reuse of treated wastewater states that “treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate”, is not specific enough to promote water reuse and it leaves too <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for interpretation {{as to what}} {{can be considered as}} an “appropriate” situation to reuse treated wastewater.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{location}} proved unsatisfactory. Although {{it was a}} popular destination for Polish visitors to Gibraltar, there was little space around the memorial and neither tour groups nor official delegations had <b>much</b> <b>room</b> to assemble in its vicinity.

25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own.

25|$|Impacted wisdom teeth (or {{impacted}} third molars) are wisdom teeth {{which do}} not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the wisdom teeth {{do not have an}} open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of impaction, how <b>much</b> <b>room</b> there is for eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|E
25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Sargsyan's Prime Ministry, Armenia had not yet {{recovered}} from the economic effects of {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.

500|$|The {{very first}} scene {{was shot in}} a small tank {{across the street from}} North Shore Studios in Vancouver.

[...] A critic from The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "The concept is clever, suggesting a new way to build horror-movie suspense without much on-camera gore.
