The work evaluates the predicative value of the mutagenicity test using bacteria strains and strives to objectify their application.

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>tests</b> have had a clearly defined role in the {{identification}} of potential human mutagens and an ancillary role {{in the identification of}} potential human carcinogens. The efficiency of short-term tests in identifying germ cell mutagens has been examined using a combined data set derived from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency/International Agency for Research on Cancer Genetic Activity Profile (EPA/IARC GAP) and EPA Gene-Tox databases. Our review of these data indicates adequate sensitivity of batteries of in vitro short-term <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>tests</b> in identifying germ cell mutagens. The analysis also supports the inclusion of an in vivo assay as suggested in proposed regulatory testing guidelines. In the context of carcinogenicity testing, the ability of short-term bioassays to detect genotoxic or mutagenic carcinogens is well established. Such tests are not considered to be as sensitive to nongenotoxic or nonmutagenic carcinogens. However, analyses presented in this report using the EPA/IARC GAP database demonstrate that many putative nongenotoxic carcinogens that have been adequately tested in short-term genetic bioassays induce gene or chromosomal mutation or aneuploidy. Further investigation should reveal whether the mutagenicity of these agents plays an important mechanistic role in their carcinogenicity...|$|E

40|$|The Salmonella microsomal assay {{has become}} an {{indispensible}} tool for the screening of mutagens and carcinogens, particularly when {{a large number of}} samples have to be tested, as in the present context for the screening of air pollution. However, for a more definite identification of potential carcinogens, a verification of the results from bacterial tests has to be performed with a battery of other tests, including point mutations and chromosomal aberrations in eukoaryotic systems. While there is a close qualitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic property of chemicals, a corresponding quantitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic potency is not always found. One reason for this lack of quantitative correlation presumably depends on the fact that cancer is induced in two steps, of which only the initiating, but not the promoting, step constitutes a mutational event, which is reflected by <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>tests.</b> Present <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>tests</b> have concentrated on discrete major mutations, while mutations of polygenes, acting on quantitative characters, have largely been omitted.

After treatment, the samples were analysed using gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to detect volatile and non-volatile compounds, the Microtox test to evaluate potential toxicity of the samples, and three <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>tests</b> – Tradescantia and Allium cepa micronucleus tests and the Comet assay on human leukocytes – to detect their genotoxic activity. GC/MS analysis did not detect phthalates or acetaldehyde in the water samples.

Statistical analyses showed a positive association between mineral content and mutagenicity (micronuclei in A. cepa and DNA damage in human leukocytes). No clear effect of treatment and PET bottle was found. These results suggest the absence of toxic compounds migrating from PET regardless of time and conditions of storage.
