50|$|U.S. investors {{account for}} {{nearly two-thirds of the}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in Honduras. The stock of U.S. direct investment in Honduras in 2005 was $402 million, up from $339 million in 2004. The overall flow of FDI into Honduras in 2005 totaled $568 million, $196 million of which was spent in the maquila sector. The United States continued as the largest contributor of FDI. The most substantial U.S. investments in Honduras are in the maquila sector, fruit production (particularly bananas, melons, and pineapple), tourism, energy generation, shrimp aquaculture, animal feed production, telecommunications, fuel distribution, cigar manufacturing, insurance, brewing, leasing, food processing, and furniture <b>manufacturing.</b> Many U.S. <b>franchises,</b> particularly in the restaurant sector, operate in Honduras.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, {{the private}} sector was {{estimated}} to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% {{and state and local}} government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%. The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1. While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{franchising}} as an organizational form {{has been gaining}} more and more importance and growing even faster than the overall economy. While we can find many business or juridical approaches and much research about franchising, {{there is a lack}} of guidelines for the planning, design and implementation of distributed <b>manufacturing</b> units within <b>franchise</b> networks. This paper presents an Axiomatic Design based concept for the design of a franchise production system with geographically distributed, changeable, scalable as well as replicable manufacturing units. The aim of this research is to derive a complete set of design parameters as well as a systematic approach for the implementation of franchise production systems. To validate and prove the developed concept it has been applied and illustrated in a real case study with an Italian franchise company...|$|R
