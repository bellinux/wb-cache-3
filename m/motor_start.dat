50|$|Electromechanical central switch {{has to be}} {{carefully}} selected as it has inherent operating times both opening and closing. It {{has to have a}} stored-energy mechanism and a DC operated release solenoid for a controllable “open” command signal. Detection of the motor current zero crossing may be obtained from a current transformer/resistor voltage sensing circuit, not a voltage crossing. The use of electromechanical contactors is not recommended for a central switch as their switch opening speed consistency is subjected to the voltage applied to the hold-in coil. During a <b>motor</b> <b>start</b> the line voltage drop will fluctuate and the magnetic flux in the hold-in device will also vary, causing deviations in opening times.|$|E

Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, {{one of the first}} being ladder logic, where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder.

50|$|To {{observe the}} effect of Back-EMF of a motor, one can perform this simple exercise. With an {{incandescent}} light on, cause a large motor such as a drill press, saw, air conditioner compressor, or vacuum cleaner to start. The light may dim briefly as the <b>motor</b> <b>starts.</b> When the armature is not turning (called locked rotor) there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the <b>motor's</b> <b>starting</b> current is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.|$|R

Additionally, the method will not mal-operate under scenarios of normal load variation, induction <b>motor</b> <b>start</b> and system fault disturbances, which improves the reliability of anti-islanding protection.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} characteristics of high voltage underground electrical mining equipment <b>motor</b> <b>start</b> and short circuit waveforms. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine a method for providing short circuit protection without intentional time delays to account for motor starts. Computer simulations of power systems identified the requirement for accurate and rapid detection systems. Analyses of high voltage longwall coal mine power systems were conducted using commercial power system analysis software. Distribution voltage, transformer impedance, power center location, and motor size affected magnitude of short circuits and <b>motor</b> <b>start</b> currents. Phase angles between voltage and current were longer for motor starts than for short circuits. A prototype with an induction motor was developed and tested in the laboratory. Minimizing the intentional time delays in short circuit protection will help ensure temperatures of ignition thresholds for gas and dust are not be exceeded on energized electrical apparatus surfaces.
