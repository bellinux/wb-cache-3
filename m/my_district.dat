25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in <b>my</b> <b>district.</b> He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
500|$|Many {{university}} professors, {{as well as}} teachers, lawyers, artists, writers, {{priests and}} other members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed, or transported to concentration camps, during operations such as AB-Aktion. This particular campaign resulted in the infamous Sonderaktion Krakau and the massacre of Lwów professors. During World War II Poland lost 39% to 45% of its physicians and dentists, 26% to 57% of its lawyers, 15% to 30% of its teachers, 30% to 40% of its scientists and university professors, and 18% to 28% of its clergy. The Jewish intelligentsia was exterminated altogether. [...] The reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a Nazi gauleiter: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>district,</b> [...] shows signs of intelligence will be shot." ...|$|E

As Gerlach later explained, “While the bill included some positive provisions to develop alternative and renewable energy our country needs, I voted against this bill because of the devastating effect it will have on working families and the people who create jobs in <b>my</b> <b>district</b> and across Pennsylvania." [...] The League of Conservation Voters, “a national non-profit organization that works to turn environmental values into national priorities,” rated Gerlach at 44 percent on their National Environmental Scorecard. In his 2010 campaign, Gerlach received $41,250 from the Energy/Natural Resource sector.|$|E
