40|$|Multi-electrode geoelectrical imaging {{has become}} very popular and is used for many {{different}} purposes. For some of these, the inclusion of IP data would be desirable as it would allow the interpreter to distinguish between, e. g. sand formations with saltwater infiltration and clay formations or help delineate landfills. However, present-day IP measuring techniques {{require the use of}} nonpolarisable potential electrodes and special wire layout and are thus cumbersome and expensive. In this paper, we suggest making IP measurements with multi-electrode cables and just one set of steel electrodes. The polarisation potentials on the potential electrodes are corrected for by subtracting the polarisation potential measured when no primary current and no IP signal are present. Test measurements indicate that the polarisation potentials vary slowly and that the correction procedure is feasible. At two sites in southern Sweden, we have compared measurements with only stainless steel electrodes and measurements with both stainless steel and Pb-PbCl nonpolarisable electrodes using one or two sets of <b>multicore</b> <b>cables,</b> respectively. Almost no difference between the two data sets was observed. At one site, the charge-up effect on the potential electrodes was not important, while at the other site, the correction procedure was crucial. Though only two sites have been studied so far, it seems that time-domain IP imaging measurements can be taken with only steel electrodes and ordinary <b>multicore</b> <b>cables.</b> Coupling in the <b>multicore</b> <b>cables</b> has not presented any problems at the investigated sites where grounding resistances were moderate, making the coupling effect small. High grounding resistance sites have not yet been investigated. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

Analytical discussion of cable resistance and reactance at harmonic frequencies is presented. An experimental procedure for obtaining full matrix impedance of cables at harmonic frequency is introduced. It is found that cable resistance increases with increasing harmonic order. Cable inductance, however, decreases {{due to the}} effect of flux cancellation. The analytical formulas presented yield reasonable accuracy for cable resistance for single-core cables, but provide an overestimation for <b>multicore</b> <b>cables.</b> The impact of various parameters on cable resistance and reactance, such as harmonic order, cable installation method, cable current distribution and the presence of magnetic material is also addressed, as well as the mechanisms for impedance variation.

50|$|The {{simplicity}} of the lighting system makes it straightforward to understand, implement and diagnose, and its low current (typically 1 mA) means it can be run along relatively thin cables with little voltage drop. However, since it requires one wire per control channel (plus a common return wire), a sophisticated system could have hundreds of wires, requiring expensive <b>multicore</b> <b>cables</b> and connectors. Over a long cable, the voltage drop requires every channel of the receiving device to be calibrated {{to compensate for the}} voltage losses. (This is only a theoretical limitation as the resistance of the thinnest practical wire is around 20 Ω/1000 m.) Capacitive coupling from nearby AC power cables can affect the signal to the fitting and even cause flickering. Signal wire running parallel to power cables for a fair distance would need to be screened.|$|R

Different termination methods can be used on each end to suit the application. When individual connectors are used, three pin XLR connectors are most common, although 1/4" [...] jack connectors are also occasionally used. Assembled audio <b>multicore</b> <b>cables</b> are found in both portable applications, where they are stored loose or on a cable drum, {{so that they can be}} taken from one location to another, or are permanently installed in a building.

Snakes are permanently installed in the walls of recording studios and performance venues such as arts centres and large nightclubs.|$|R
40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and water blocking material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water blocking of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking. To address these new challenges, new water blocking materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures. The new materials included a thin water blocking tape for use in power conductors, a new high-capacity water blocking yarn designed for use in conductors and two new water blocking filler yarns designed {{for use in the}} interstitial areas between conductors in LV and MV <b>multicore</b> <b>cables</b> In addition, methods were developed to analyze power cable geometry and produce an estimated bill of materials for water blocking.

40|$|International audienceElectrodes and cables are {{sometimes}} embedded or buried permanently {{into the ground}} {{in order to minimize}} electrode location errors during long electrical resistivity monitoring. This procedure is efficient and useful. In order to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of this technique for a long monitoring of water content in a rock mass, electrical resistivity data have been repeatedly acquired from a buried array. Forty-eight steel electrodes composed the array, connected to two <b>multicore</b> <b>cables,</b> which have been buried in a trench since January 2006. A fast resistivity-meter was used to carry out dipole-dipole electrical measurements, over a period of one year, starting in December 2006. Data acquisitions of repeated resistivity measurements have been realized in order to distinguish between variations in electrical resistivity due to noise and to changes in water content. Around once every month, successive dipole-dipole array measurements on the same day (between three and eleven arrays with around 10 minutes for one array) have been performed. Using all the pseudosections recorded the same day, the coefficients of variation have been calculated for each data point. Results show that the variability of the data is six times greater when the data from the first array of the day-series are taken into account. The data collected from this first array are therefore significantly noisier than the following measurements and must be removed for correct interpretation. We propose two main explanations for this effect: 1) polarization of the system array/clay {{at the time of the}} first acquisition and 2) damage encountered into the buried cables. Despite this damage, we have shown that the electrical data can be consistent and correctly exploited if the first acquisition of the day is not taken into account. In conclusion, on the basis of the results presented here, we recommend that further studies be made using buried equipment to systematically carry out several acquisitions before starting the long monitoring. We also recommend to remove data from the first acquisition whenever they are found to be significantly noisier than data of the following acquisitions...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{is gaining}} {{importance in the}} field of geophysics and there is increasing interest for accurate borehole EIT measurements in a broad frequency range (mHz to kHz) in order to study subsurface properties. To characterize weakly polarizable soils and sediments with EIT, high phase accuracy is required. Typically, long electrode cables are used for borehole measurements. However, this may lead to undesired electromagnetic coupling effects associated with inductive coupling between the double wire pairs for current injection and potential measurement and capacitive coupling between the electrically conductive shield of the cable and the electrically conductive environment surrounding the electrode cables. Depending on the electrical properties of the subsurface and the measured transfer impedances, both coupling effects can cause large phase errors that have typically limited the frequency bandwidth of field EIT measurements to the mHz to Hz range. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop numerical corrections for these phase errors. To this end, the inductive coupling effect was modeled using electronic circuit models and the capacitive coupling effect was modeled by integrating discrete capacitances in the electrical forward model describing the EIT measurement process. The correction methods were successfully verified with measurements under controlled conditions in a water-filled rain barrel, where a high phase accuracy of 0. 8 mrad in the frequency range up to 10 kHz was achieved. The corrections were also applied to field EIT measurements made using a 25 m long EIT borehole chain with 8 electrodes and an electrode separation of 1 m. The results of a 1 D inversion of these measurements showed that the correction methods increased the measurement accuracy considerably. It was concluded that the proposed correction methods enlarge the bandwidth of the field EIT measurement system, and that accurate EIT measurements can now be made in the mHz to kHz frequency range. This increased accuracy in the kHz range will allow a more accurate field characterization of the complex electrical conductivity of soils and sediments, which may lead to improved estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity from electrical properties. Although the correction methods have been developed for a custom-made EIT system, they also have potential to improve to the phase accuracy of EIT measurements made with commercial systems relying on <b>multicore</b> <b>cables...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{long-established}} pace {{of progress}} in semiconductor electronics, expressed by Moore's Law, has led to new opportunities in medical ultrasound imaging. Traditionally, ultrasound systems have separated the transducer array {{from most of the}} electronic instrumentation, with <b>multicore</b> physical <b>cabling</b> in between. This avoids problems with electrical power, functional density, and communication bandwidth. However, it is far from ideal in terms of cost, ergonomics, and the need to interface instrumentation and the transducer with the cable, and it causes particular difficulties with miniature devices. Given these issues, and the relatively slow progress in front end transducer technology, integration of the transducer with electronics is certain to increase, most likely at a pace governed by financial investment, development of electronics for other applications, and the realisation of high volume ultrasound applications. This paper therefore considers motivations for increased integration, technical barriers, and relevant new techniques, particularly related to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Increased integration will rely on advances in integrated circuit (IC) electronics, device assembly, and microsystems engineering, with key constraints being the packaging of a system in a small volume and the power supply. System partitioning will determine where functionality will reside physically within the imaging hardware and software. This paper considers relevant recent developments in academic research and industry, with a particular focus on medical applications. IC design is important because it defines parameters such as power consumption. 45 nm ICs are now in high volume production but the present relatively small ultrasound market makes adoption difficult. Ingenuity in exploiting existing technology cost-effectively and bespoke engineering where required are likely to be important for integration of piezoelectric material with electronics technology and funct- - ionality will correspond with different layers in a device. In this paper, examples are selected from the authors' work to illustrate progress and suggest how MEMS roadmaps and application demands may relate to future systems...|$|R
40|$|As the use {{of power}} {{electronics}} and inductive loads on electrical supplies increases, the requirement to monitor power system quality becomes an increasingly common practice. The negative effects these loads have on supply balance and frequency can {{be reflected in the}} efficiency, and therefore the running costs, of said loads. With demand for analysis techniques in industry increasing, and the PC becoming a more popular tool for such applications, a low-cost PC-based electrical system analyser was proposed to demonstrate a cost-effective, accurate alternative to the expensive market-leading products. This study researches the problem at hand, the technology available, and the development and testing of the analyser in a laboratory environment. The success of this study was determined by the accuracy, cost, functionality and features of the analyser compared with those of an existing product. The final product was to be a virtual instrument (VI) PC application implemented using the industry-leading LabVIEW software package by National Instruments. Two major challenges of the study were the correct measurement of the fundamental voltage and current waveforms, and the appropriate/accurate reconstruction, manipulation and display of these signals within the software. Identification, and minimisation or correction, of measurement errors was an important factor in achieving maximum accuracy prior to software interpretation of the data. Testing and calibration were carried out with the aim of providing the most accurate signal measurement prior to data acquisition and rescaling by the software program. Industry-standard design and manufacture techniques were implemented to produce a high-quality hardware package featuring a printed circuit board, ingress protection (IP) rated enclosure and screened <b>multicore</b> signal <b>cabling.</b> The potential uses and benefits of the analyser include monitoring loads in factory floor or manufacturing environments where production costs are of significant importance; in this instance, multiple analysers could be in place over the floor to aid operators. Smaller companies using smaller amounts of large machinery may implement a PC-based system as a cheaper alternative to an expensive all-in-one unit. The study concluded that a reasonably accurate PC-based analyser could be produced on a small budget; it also highlighted the many advantages of a PC-based system in terms of usability, customisation and flexibility.
