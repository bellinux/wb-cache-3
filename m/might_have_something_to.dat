Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact that}} most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E
2500|$|The New Testament {{repeats the}} commandment not to steal, {{contains}} dire warnings about spiritual {{consequences of the}} practice, and upholds the basic ideas of private property rights and {{the proper role of}} governmental authorities in punishing thieves. [...] Thieves are exhorted to steal no longer, but to work hard with their own hands so that they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> share with people in need. [...] Aquinas identifies five types of theft: by stealth, by violence, in withholding wages, fraud, and by buying positions of preferment.|$|E

2500|$|People {{inside the}} mall have been {{questioned}} or detained for operating video cameras, using notebooks, or other perceived suspicious behaviors. , Michael Rozin, the former Special Operations Security Captain {{and founder of}} the mall's behavior detection unit instructed its members that [...] "suspicious behavior" [...] constitutes [...] "photographing such things as air-conditioning ducts or signs that a shopper <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide." [...] Commander Jim Ryan of the Bloomington Police Department commented that the mall's security methods may [...] "infringe on some freedoms, unfortunately." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{decision}} {{to oppose the}} GST in 1990 was taken for reasons of political expediency rather than for principle, namely that Chrétien needed an issue to oppose the government on {{that would allow him}} to connect with the public; sources close to Chrétien were later to claim that he had wanted to support the GST bill, but had been forced by his caucus against his will to oppose it. At a Liberal event in the fall of 1990, Chrétien stated that if he became Prime Minister [...] "the Mulroney GST will disappear", going on to say: [...] "I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it. And I will be opposed to it, always". To capitalise on widespread public dislike on the proposed GST, Chrétien ordered the Liberal-dominated Senate to defeat the GST bill in late September 1990, leading Mulroney on September 27, 1990, to appoint 8 Conservative senators to give the Tories a majority using a never-before-used section of the Constitution Act, the so-called [...] "Deadlock Clause". At that point, Chrétien ordered the Liberal senators to filibuster the GST bill, reducing the Senate to scenes of chaos for the entire fall of 1990. On October 24, 1990, a poll revealed that the Liberals had fallen behind the New Democrats, which Chrétien admitted in an interview <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the scenes of obstructionist, often childish behavior by the Liberal senators.|$|E

50|$|The {{social and}} {{political}} rise of the Sedatii illustrates {{the decline of the}} aristocratic Iulii who had been the leading class in Roman Gaul since the time of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The possible marriage of Severianus' father with Julia Rufina <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the association between winemakers and land owners which would be the leading class in Gaul until the Flavians.|$|R

50|$|Nagy {{informed}} {{the military that}} they should arrest Béla Kiss immediately, {{if he was still}} alive - there was also a possibility that he was a prisoner of war. The name, unfortunately, was very common. Nagy also arrested the housekeeper, Mrs Jakubec and asked the postal service to hold any possible letters to Kiss, in case he had an accomplice that could warn him. Nagy initially suspected that Jakubec <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the murders, especially when Kiss had left her money in his will.|$|R

"That she {{was really}} in great distress," [...] {{he went on to}} say, [...] "was plainly to be seen; but that in that {{particular}} instance, your Plujii had any hand in tormenting her, I had some boisterous doubts. For, hearing that an hour or two previous she had been partaking of some twenty unripe bananas, I rather fancied that that circumstance <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with her sufferings. But however it was, all the herb-leeches on the island would not have altered her own opinions on the subject." ...|$|R

60|$|Dare {{was seated}} beside {{a table in}} an {{attitude}} of application which seemed to imply {{that he had come}} early and engaged in this pursuit in a systematic manner. Somerset had never witnessed Dare and De Stancy together, neither had he heard of any engagement of Dare by the travelling party as artist, courier, or otherwise; and yet it crossed his mind that Dare <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with them, or at least have seen them. This possibility was enough to overmaster Somerset's reluctance to speak to the young man, and he did so as soon as an opportunity occurred.|$|R

60|$|There {{was only}} one hope that he could see: {{and that was to}} switch the people's mind on to some other excitement. His advices from London told him that a {{parliamentary}} crisis was pending. Could not Mrs. Denton and her party do something to hasten it?

6000|$|When {{the five}} little eggs were all laid, the mother-bird began {{to sit on}} them; and {{at any time of}} day or night, when a little head peeped out of the nursery window, might be seen a round, bright, patient pair of bird's eyes contentedly waiting for the young birds to come. It seemed a long time for the {{children}} to wait; but every day they put some bread and cake from their luncheon on the window-sill, so that the birds <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat; but still there she was, patiently sitting! ...|$|E
