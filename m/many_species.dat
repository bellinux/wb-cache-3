5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} light and dark. <b>Many</b> <b>species</b> have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. <b>Many</b> <b>species</b> are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in <b>many</b> <b>species</b> and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian mimicry, where the mimic is also distasteful, and the mimicry {{can be considered}} mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of hoverfly and the wasp beetle. <b>Many</b> <b>species</b> of wasp are involved in Müllerian mimicry, as are <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of bee.|$|E
5|$|Everglades National Park is an {{important}} part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. It has great biodiversity and <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of birds for bird watching and bird photography also.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that there are <b>many</b> undiscovered <b>species</b> of blindsnakes, so it is likely that there are <b>many</b> more <b>species</b> of gerrhopilids yet to be discovered.|$|R
25|$|<b>Many</b> Ambrosia <b>species</b> {{occur in}} desert and {{semi-desert}} areas, and <b>many</b> are ruderal <b>species</b> that grow in disturbed habitat types.|$|R
50|$|Some 250 {{plant species}} were {{recorded}} in the initial surveys including 7 yet undescribed <b>species.</b> <b>Many</b> more <b>species</b> are yet to be collected.|$|R
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten <b>many</b> <b>species</b> with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of <b>many</b> <b>species</b> for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>species</b> {{are kept}} as pets, {{the most popular}} being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. These are often anthropomorphised.|$|E

50|$|Aspergillus and <b>many</b> other <b>species</b> have septate hyphae.|$|R
5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for <b>many</b> <b>species</b> to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts <b>many</b> <b>species</b> that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquatic animals}} most often hunted for sport are fish, {{including}} <b>many</b> <b>species</b> from large marine predators such as sharks and tuna, to freshwater fish such as trout and carp.|$|E

50|$|The Oligocene Epoch spans from 33.9 {{million to}} 23.03 million years ago. The Oligocene {{featured}} {{the expansion of}} grass which had led to <b>many</b> new <b>species</b> to evolve, including the first elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials and <b>many</b> other <b>species</b> still prevalent today. <b>Many</b> other <b>species</b> of plants evolved in this period too, such as the evergreen trees Conifers. A cooling period was still in effect and seasonal rains were as well. Mammals still continued to grow larger and larger. Paraceratherium, the largest land mammal to ever live evolved during this period.|$|R
50|$|Firefly luciferin is the luciferin, or {{light-emitting}} compound, {{found in}} <b>many</b> firefly (Lampyridae) <b>species.</b> It is the substrate of luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7), {{which is responsible}} for the characteristic yellow light emission from <b>many</b> firefly <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|Surf {{fishing is}} done often {{at night to}} follow the nocturnal feeding habits of <b>many</b> target <b>species.</b> <b>Many</b> surf {{fishermen}} add items such as flashlights, headlamps, light sticks and other gear to facilitate night fishing.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of Psittacosaurus {{have been}} named, their {{relationships}} {{to each other}} {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve <b>many</b> <b>species</b> in a mimicry ring.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches {{on their backs}} or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in <b>many</b> <b>species</b> are hooked at the tip.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. <b>Many</b> <b>species</b> supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Australian robins are a {{group of}} small insectivorous birds, whose exact {{position}} in the bird family tree is unclear. Named after a superficial resemblance to the European robin, the males of <b>many</b> <b>species</b> sport bright red or pink on their plumage. Four species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in <b>many</b> <b>species</b> of Caricaceae.|$|E
