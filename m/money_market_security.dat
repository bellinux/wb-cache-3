The main findings are that common institutions, such as a regional central bank and securities exchange have led to high cross-border transactions within the union.

40|$|Credit {{ratings have}} contributed to the current {{financial}} crisis. Proposals to regulate credit rating agencies focus on micro-prudential issues and aim at reducing conflicts of interest and increasing transparency and competition. In contrast, this paper argues that macro-prudential regulation is necessary to address the systemic risk inherent to ratings. The paper illustrates how financial markets have increasingly relied on ratings. It shows how downgrades have led to systemic market losses and increased illiquidity. The paper suggests the use of "ratings maps" and stress-tests to assess the systemic risk of ratings, and increased capital or liquidity buffers to manage such risk.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the day-of-the-week effect for three primary <b>money</b> <b>market</b> {{instruments}} in Canada. The sample period is 1980 - 2009. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use three approaches. First, a parametric t-test is employed to determine if a particular day-of-the-week mean return is significantly different from zero, using both a full sample and a trimmed sample. Next, the Wilcoxon signed ranked test is utilized to assess whether the median weekday return is different from zero for each day. Lastly, a binary regression model is used to test if Monday's mean return is different from other days. Findings – The traditional Monday effect is prevalent in the 1980 s for corporate paper and treasury bills (TB), but not for bankers acceptances (BA). In the 1990 s, the Monday effect disappears completely. However, in the 2000 s the Monday effect reappears, but is positive (it reverses) for both corporate paper and BA. The authors also find strong support for Wednesday being a high return day, which concurs with related <b>money</b> <b>market</b> studies. Research limitations/implications – While the results are statistically significant, the economic significance is dubious. This study helps market participants in that it shows that they need to allow for distinct day-of-the-week patterns when using yield spreads. Practical implications – One practical implication for practitioners is to time purchases of Canadian <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>securities</b> for Monday when returns are low (relying on the results of the full sample period). Issuers should time sales for non-Mondays when returns are higher and yields are lower. Originality/value – This study is original in that it is the first one to analyze day-of-the-week effects in the Canadian <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> The authors compare the results to studies that focus on the US market.

Market development has been limited by hurdles confronting borrowers and lenders, current and potential liquidity providers, and insufficient support from government policies and regulations. Besides fostering a credit culture to deepen local debt markets, the issue of critical size can be addressed through an integrated regional market for local currency bonds that provides greater scale, efficiency, and access. With rapid economic growth in Asia, a key challenge is to generate financial assets that can provide the underlying collateral for expanding fixed-income markets, and hence domestic and regional investment opportunities.

40|$|Purpose – In {{line with}} the government's policy to promote Malaysia as an {{international}} hub for Islamic banking and finance, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to evaluate the dynamic effects of both Islamic and conventional stock markets on foreign portfolio investments. Design/methodology/approach – First, the paper explores the short and long-run relationships between (FPI) and three markets, i. e. the goods, <b>money,</b> and <b>securities</b> <b>market.</b> Second, the paper attempts to examine the relative importance of the three markets in accounting for variations in FPI. Consistent with earlier studies, the goods market variable considered is real income (Y). The <b>money</b> <b>market</b> variables tested are the broad money supply (M 2), treasury bill rate (TBR) and the US Federal Fund rate (FFR), while the <b>security</b> <b>market</b> is represented by both Kuala Lumpur Shari'ah Index (KLSI) and Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI). Findings – The findings of the study indicate that among the three <b>markets</b> studied, the <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> in Malaysia (both conventional and Islamic) is the most significant market in attracting FPI into the economy. This implies that to a certain extent, the government's effort in promoting Malaysia as the international hub for the Islamic capital market has been successful.

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} CRR, banks are {{required}} to maintain liquid assets {{in the form of}} gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts thebank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities. In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open <b>money</b> <b>market,</b> government <b>securities</b> are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open market operations in the more recent years.

40|$|Emerging European {{countries}} have made large strides in developing their local capital markets since the early- 1990 s. However, {{the rate of}} development has been widely disparate across countries and market segments, underpinned by the varying degrees of progress made in key areas such as establishing pricing benchmarks, adopting, implementing and enforcing securities laws and regulations, encouraging the growth of an institutional investor base, and providing adequate trading infrastructure. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the trends in the region''s local capital markets, and examines the main factors that have contributed to their growth and effectiveness to date. It also discusses selected policy responses necessary to further improve the breadth and depth of these markets.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the euro area <b>money</b> and bond <b>markets</b> and their infrastructure since the introduction of the euro. Significant development in terms of integration took place in both markets in general to a various degree for the different segments. However, there remain room for further integration after the first year of Stage III of EMU notably regarding the bond market which lags behind in terms of liquidity, market completeness and overall size compared to the US corporate bond market. Analysis of the barriers to integration, which {{do not seem to be}} specific to these markets but apply more generally to euro securities infrastructure, identifies fields where further action is required. This covers (i) the lack of availability of cross-border settlement on a DVP basis, (ii) the lack of standardised legal documentation for repos, (iii) the lack of common practices concerning settlement procedures, (iv) the lack or harmonisation of collateralisation processes between national central banks and interbank operations, (v) the heterogeneity in fiscal and accounting procedures and, (vi) the need for a clearing house. <b>money</b> <b>market,</b> bond <b>market,</b> <b>securities</b> <b>market,</b> financial market integration, euro area, monetary policy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} {{countries}} have undertaken far-reaching reforms of their financial sectors. Generally speaking, financial sector reforms aim at achieving greater flexibility of interest rates, an enhanced role for market forces in credit allocation, increased independence for the central bank, and a deepening of <b>money</b> and <b>securities</b> <b>markets.</b> Such reforms, and the developments that follow, have important implications for the design and conduct of monetary policy. This paper provides an overview of the linkages between financial sector reforms and the monetary policy framework, focusing in particular on the objectives, instruments, and operating procedures of monetary policy.
