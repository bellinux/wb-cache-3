5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin whale (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin whale, have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the <b>minke</b> <b>whale.</b> The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> and pygmy right whale). Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
25|$|Blue and fin whales were {{primarily}} hunted, but humpback and sei whales were also included. However, prior to 1914 Icelanders did not hunt <b>minke</b> <b>whales.</b> Superstition held that <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> were sent by God as protectors.|$|R

50|$|They {{appear to}} {{disperse}} into offshore waters during the breeding season. In the spring (October-December), Japanese sighting surveys from 1976 to 1987 recorded relatively high encounter rates of <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> off South Africa and Mozambique (20° - 30°S, 30° - 40°E), off Western Australia (20° - 30°S, 110° - 120°E), around the Gambier Islands of French Polynesia (20° - 30°S, 130° - 140°W), {{and in the}} eastern South Pacific (10° - 20°S, 110° - 120°W). Later surveys, which distinguished between Antarctic and dwarf <b>minke</b> <b>whales,</b> showed {{that most of these}} were Antarctic <b>minke</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E

25|$|The IWC {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} in 1987 recommending Japan not proceed until disagreements over its research proposals were resolved. A second resolution was also adopted on February 14, 1988 recommending Japan not proceed. On February 9, 1988 Japanese whalers killed the first <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> in Antarctic waters {{under the new}} self issued research whaling permit. U.S. President Ronald Reagan responded by cutting off Japanese fishing privileges in U.S. waters on April 6, 1988 under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Cetaceans were {{historically}} abundant {{around the}} island as commercial hunts on the island was operating until 1956. Today, numbers of larger whales have disappeared, but even today many species such humpback whale, <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> sei whale, and dolphins can be observed close to shore, and scientific surveys have been conducted regularly. Southern right whales were once regular migrants to Norfolk, but were severely depleted by historical hunts, and further by recent illegal Soviet and Japanese whaling, resulting in none or very few, if remnants still live, right whales in these regions along with Lord Howe Island.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{claims that}} it strongly supports the protection of endangered species, and the scientific whaling is essential to gather information {{about the status of}} the various populations. It further claims that the scale of the research is such that it does not affect the stock of the species. The 1985 IWC estimate put the Southern Hemisphere <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> population at 761,000 (510,000–1,140,000 in the 95% confidence estimate). A paper submitted to the IWC on population estimates in Antarctic waters using CNB gives a population of 665,074 based on Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research Programme (SOWER) data.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin <b>whales</b> and 100 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|R
25|$|The {{surrounding}} seas are fished for prawns and scallops {{and there}} is a lease for a salmon farm off the south eastern shores of Lunga just north of the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais by the islet Sgeir Mhic an Altair. This part of the seabed is also a haven for the rare seafan anemone Amphianthus dohrnii. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominates much of the surrounding infralittoral in areas not swept by the strongest tides. In some sheltered locations with deeper water there are feather stars including Leptometra celtica and the hydroid Lytocarpia myriophyllum. On land the island is home to European otter and red deer. Atlantic grey seals, <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> bottlenose dolphin, and harbour porpoise are regular marine visitors. Golden and white-tailed sea eagles are also commonly sighted. The area is of growing importance for various leisure activities including scuba diving and canoeing.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} trade of whale meat is prohibited by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty {{in order to}} remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan. In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese market could absorb. In negotiations with Marc Wall, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal to suggest to Iceland {{to reduce the number of}} killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.|$|E
25|$|These hunts are {{a source}} of {{conflict}} between pro- and anti-whaling countries and organizations. The U.N.'s International Court of Justice, in addition to other Nations, scientists, and environmental organizations consider the Japanese research program to be unnecessary and lacking scientific merit, and describe it as a thinly disguised commercial whaling operation. Japan maintains that annual whaling is sustainable and necessary for scientific study and management of whale stocks, though the Antarctic <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> populations have declined {{since the beginning of the}} JARPA program and those whales killed have shown increasing signs of stress. Japan, echoing Norway's arguments on its own whaling activities, also argues it is entitled to continue whaling because because of whaling's place in its cultural heritage. The whale meat from these hunts is sold in shops and restaurants, and is showcased at an annual food festival that, in some cases, features the butchering of a whale for onlooking children. A poll in 2014 found that few Japanese people today eat whale meat regularly, and tourists are often reluctant to try it on ethical grounds.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{estimates}} {{suggested that}} there were several hundred thousand <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> in the Southern Ocean. In 2012, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission agreed upon a best estimate of 515,000. The Report of the Scientific Committee acknowledged that this estimate is subject to some degree of negative bias because some <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> would have been outside the surveyable ice edge boundaries.|$|R
40|$|DDTs (p, p 2 ̆ 7 -DDE+p, p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT) and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) were {{determined}} {{in the liver}} of male <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> collected from the Southern Ocean during the 1980 - 1981 whaling season. DDTs ranged from 3. 6 to 70 ng/g and PCBs from 1. 2 to 18 ng/g on lipid weight basis. These values were apparently lower than those in northern baleen whales and also in southern toothed whales. This seems to be attributable to the smaller extent of contamination by these pollutants in the southern hemisphere and the habits of <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> feeding on lower trophic organisms, primarily eupausiids, in the Antarctic ecosystem. Considerably high concentrations of DDTs and PCBs were found in young <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> and a continuous increase of these was observed in older animals after approximately 20 years of age. These trends probably arise from feeding habits of <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> associated with migration and segregation in age groups of young and old...|$|R
40|$|In 1974 and 1975 a {{total of}} 188 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and 14 {{humpback}} whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have been marked in the Barents Sea and at Svalbard. In addition 2 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> have been tagged north of Shetland. Sighted whales in the Barents Sea and at Svalbard include 1069 <b>minke</b> <b>whales,</b> 25 humpback whales, 1 fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), 2500 - 3000 white-beaked dolphins (Lagenor albirostris) about 50 common porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and l Greenland right whale (Balaena mysticetus) with calf. Off the coast of Norway 2 humpback whales,l sperm whale (Physeter catodon), 400 - 500 killer whales (Orcinus orca) and 8 - 10 Sowerbys whales (Mesoplodon bidens) were observed. Observations made during the cruises suggest that <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> breath and {{are exposed to the}} air for 3 - 4 seconds only and that dives may last for any period between 12 seconds and 10 minutes when they are followed (not chased) by ships.

25|$|Along the {{mediterranean}} {{regions of the}} Arabian Sea, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Kutch, the Gulf of Suez, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Gulf of Aden, and the Gulf of Oman, dolphins and finless porpoises {{are the most common}} marine mammals in the waters, while larger whales and orcas are rarer today. Historically, whales had been abundant in the gulf before commercial hunts wiped them out. Whales were reduced even further by illegal mass hunts by the Soviet Union and Japan in the 1960s and 70s. Along with Bryde's whales, the most common and possible resident and still can be seen in deeper marginal seas such as Gulf of Aden, Israel coasts, and in Strait of Hormuz. Other species such as the critically endangered Arabian humpback whale (also historically common in Gulf of Aden, and sighting records increased in Red Sea since in 2006 including in Gulf of Aqaba), omura's whale, <b>minke</b> <b>whale,</b> and orca also swim into the gulf, while many other large species such as blue whale, sei, and sperm whales were once migrants into the Gulf of Oman and off the coasts in deeper waters, and still migrate in Red Sea, but mainly in deeper waters of outer seas. In 2017, waters of Persian Gulf along Abu Dhabi was revealed to hold world's largest population of Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins.|$|E
500|$|The {{humpback}} {{social structure}} is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live {{alone or in}} small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps with other whale and dolphin species—for instance, the <b>minke</b> <b>whale.</b> Humpback whales often leap out of the water, a behaviour known as [...] "breaching", and slap the water with their fins or tails ...|$|E
500|$|In the mid-17th century, Eday was {{described}} as being [...] "absolutely full of moorland birds" [...] and today there are red-throated divers on Mill Loch, Arctic skuas and bonxies on the moors and black guillemot offshore. Shore birds include meadow pipit, rock pipit and ringed plover. The woodland at Carrick House attracts a variety of migrants and otters can be seen around the coasts. There are colonies of harbour and grey seals on Muckle Green Holm, Little Green Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray, and white-beaked dolphin, <b>minke</b> <b>whale</b> and killer whale are occasional visitors to the area.

5000|$|Few dwarf <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} taken by whaling operations. Thirteen were caught off Durban, South Africa, between 1970 and 1973. Nearly all of them (12 of 13, or 92%) were taken {{in the first half}} of the season (April to June), over three-quarters within 30 nautical miles of shore. Of 902 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> caught off northeastern Brazil in 1980, only three were dwarf. Of 1,789 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> caught in the Southern Ocean by the Japanese between 1987-88 and 1992-93, only 16 were dwarf minkes (one was caught in 1987-88, five in 1988-89, three in 1989-90, four in 1990-91, and three in 1992-93). These were taken from December to March between the latitudes of 55°22'S and 65°04'S and the longitudes of 111°26'E and 178°12'E. An additional 180 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> (47 males, 133 females) which had flippers with a [...] "clear white band" [...] were taken by Japanese expeditions in the sub-Antarctic between 1972-73 and 1976-77, with a peak of 69 in 1975-76.|$|R
40|$|Small whale {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in the month May and June 1972 with two whaling vessels in the area off Svalbard and in the Barents. Sea. As far as possible all whales observed during the cruise were recorded. Poor weather was probably the reason why only 10 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and 2 killer whales (Orcinus orca) were observed in the beginning of May off Spitsbergen and only 3 — 4 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> and 2 killer whales near Centralbanken. During the period 10 — 16 June two fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus} but no <b>minke</b> <b>whales,</b> were observed off Spitsbergen. The weather was better in the Barents Sea, and <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> were found in areas with good food conditions. Between 24 — 27 May 50 — 60 <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> were observed at Østbanken, and between 3 — 10 June 80 <b>minke</b> <b>whales,</b> 7 killer whales and 2 fin whales were seen in the area Østbanken — Lewis Hole. At Nordkappbanken 100 — 200 white beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) were observed. Altogether 39 females and 8 males of <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> were caught by the two vessels. General biological data including total length and 20 body measurements were sampled from all the catch. Blood and tissue samples were collected for a study of population criteria. Of the females 24 were sexually immature and 15 mature. All the mature females were pregnant, which supports the earlier statements that the <b>minke</b> <b>whales</b> in the north Atlantic give birth every year. All the foetuses were found, and 14 of these measured from 29. 0 to 80. 3 cm with a mean lenght of 54. 0 cm. The 15 th was an embryo with a length of 8. 5 mm. This material indicates a pairing season between January and May. From the small numbers of corpora in the ovary it may be oncluded that the females in the catch are relatively young. The length at sexual maturity and the length distribution in the catch are nearly the same as in previous findings. Examination of stomach contents showed that the whales had fed on krill, capelin and polar cod...|$|R
