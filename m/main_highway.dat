5|$|There {{are three}} {{business}} routes of US Highway 10 {{in the state}} of Michigan. They serve as connections from the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> into Reed City, Clare and Midland. Additionally, there were another two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac. All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US10 that were marked Business US Highway10 (Bus. US10) after the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> was realigned to bypass the downtowns of the cities.|$|E

50|$|In June 1931, the Railway Department {{informed}} the <b>Main</b> <b>Highways</b> Board {{that it would}} increase the charges for the Rakaia Bridge. This resulted in the <b>Main</b> <b>Highways</b> Board to start investigations for a new exclusive road bridge, which finished in March 1933. Some months later, negotiations were started for the <b>Main</b> <b>Highways</b> Board to buy the existing bridge for it to become an exclusive road bridge. Meanwhile, the Railway Department desired a new bridge as trains were getting heavier.|$|R

In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E
5|$|M-130 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the southeastern corner of the US state of Michigan. It ran from a junction with US Highway23/M-50 (US23/M-50) northward across the River Raisin and then turned southeasterly along North Custer Road {{on the north side}} of the river to Monroe. The highway designation was commissioned in 1929 and used until 1955. M-130 had a spur route that was created in 1938 and lasted until the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> was removed from the state highway system. Both highways are now under local control.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Mackinac Bridge, {{travelers}} wishing to venture from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City had to do so via ferry. M-122 began at US2 (now Business Loop Interstate 75) near Straits State Park and traveled through town along Ferry Road where it ran southeasterly from the <b>main</b> <b>highway.</b> East of Hornbach Street M-122 curved around to the east near Paro Street. The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast side of the city next to the Coast Guard station.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{incarnation}} of M-171 {{served as a}} loop route off US23 which departed the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> east of Spruce, traveled west through Spruce, then north past Hubbard Lake and through Wilson before returning to US23 near Alpena. This roadway was part of US23 before it was redesignated M-171 in 1932. This routing is now occupied by the present day routings of Spruce, Hubbard Lake and Wilson roads. This version of M-171 {{was removed from the}} system in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The routing of US223 {{was changed}} through Adrian in 1935, {{shifting}} the highway along different streets through town. Another change in 1942 through Adrian {{led to the}} creation of the first business loop through the city. This version of the business loop lasted until the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> was moved a second time in 1956. With this subsequent move, the business loop designation was shifted to its current location.|$|E
5|$|Travel between Haifa and {{the center}} of the country is {{possible}} by road with Highway 2, the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the downtown area of the city; the Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|US41 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a US Highway in 1926. A section of the highway originally served as part of Military Road, a connection between Fort Wilkins and Fort Howard during the Civil War. US41 replaced the original M-15 designation of the highway which dated back {{to the formation of}} the Michigan state trunkline highway system. M-15 ran from Menominee through Marquette to Houghton and ended in Copper Harbor. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in Delta and Marquette counties and have created three business loops off the <b>main</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> running north–south through Gaylord {{was part of}} the {{original}} M-14.

The business loop was not created at that time, however. Instead, it was created in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was {{a locally}} {{maintained}} business loop highway routing through the {{central business district}} of the city. The route was designated when US8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in the 1990s. The former routing of US8 through the area {{was turned over to}} the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> south of town. The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.|$|E
5|$|County Road 492 (CR492, Co. Rd. 492) is {{a primary}} county road in Marquette County, Michigan. The road serves as an {{alternate}} route between Negaunee and Marquette. Several historic sites line the roadway as it runs south and parallel to the <b>main</b> <b>highway,</b> U.S. Highway 41 (US41) and M-28, through the Marquette Iron Range in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The path of the road runs near tracks of the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad (LS).

The western terminus of the county road is on US41/M-28 in Negaunee and the eastern end is in Marquette next to Lake Superior.|$|E
