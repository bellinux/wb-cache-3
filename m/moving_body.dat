25|$|Intrinsic {{rotations}} are elemental rotations {{that occur}} about the axes of a coordinate system XYZ {{attached to a}} <b>moving</b> <b>body.</b> Therefore, they change their orientation after each elemental rotation.

Bill returns to her flat, and is chased by a <b>moving</b> <b>body</b> of fluid, which takes Heather's form. She runs to the Doctor's office, where fluid-Heather materialises, forcing him and Bill into the TARDIS. The Doctor moves the TARDIS elsewhere in the university, where he and Nardole check on a vault they have been guarding. They conclude that fluid-Heather is only interested in Bill just as the creature appears, causing the trio to flee in the TARDIS.|$|E
25|$|In 1669, Christian Huygens {{published}} his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant {{before and after}} the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his Horologium Oscillatorium, he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a <b>moving</b> <b>body,</b> and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.|$|E

500|$|Mu waves {{have been}} studied since the 1930s, and are {{referred}} to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble croquet wickets. In 1950, Henri Gastaut and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else. These results were later confirmed by additional research groups, including a study using [...] electrode grids in epileptic patients. The latter study showed mu suppression while the patients observed <b>moving</b> <b>body</b> parts in somatic areas of the cortex that corresponded to the body part moved by the actor. Further {{studies have shown that the}} mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions and by passively viewing point-light biological motion.|$|E
500|$|As in his {{psychological}} theory, Hobbes's physical conatus is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is {{the beginning}} of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of impetus, as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical conatus. It is [...] "a measure of the conatus exercised by a <b>moving</b> <b>body</b> over the course of time". Resistance is caused by a contrary conatus; force is this motion plus [...] "the magnitude of the body". Hobbes also uses the word conatus to refer to the [...] "restorative forces" [...] which may cause springs, for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material elasticity.|$|E
500|$|In the 6th century, John Philoponus (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, {{noting the}} {{inconsistency}} between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where {{the medium of}} aether keeps projectiles going, and {{his discussion of the}} void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or conatus implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion. This view was strongly opposed by Averroës and many scholastic philosophers who supported Aristotle. The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views, while he developed a concept similar to inertia. The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary Avicenna, who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance, making him [...] "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion." [...] Avicenna's concept of mayl is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of Newton's first law of motion. Avicenna also developed an idea similar to momentum, when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the weight and velocity of a <b>moving</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
