40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the roles of}} domestic and international variables in predicting expansion and recession regimes of the growth rate cycle for Germany, France, Italy and the UK over the period 1972 to 2003, using a range of real and financial variables as leading indicators. The output <b>gap,</b> <b>stock</b> market prices and interest rates {{are found to be}} the most important variables in the domestic models. Consideration of international variables leads to prominent roles for the composite leading indicators for Europe and the US, and sometimes for US or German interest rates. Both the domestic output gap and the international composite leading indicators typically play negative roles for the probability of a growth cycle expansion, so that relatively extreme values of these may be helpful in predicting regime changes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 High yield {{unbleached}} kraft pulp for linerboard and bag paper was deshived in a PFI mill and a Bauer model 187 double disk refiner. Levels of plate gap, specific energy consumption, throughput rate, and stock consistency were varied to control PFI mill and Bauer 187 deshive refining. Shive content reductions were accurately monitored with the von Alf than shives analyzer. Mathematical models expressing post-treatment von Alf than values {{in terms of}} the four control variables were proposed for both refining machines. The PFI mill was an effective deshive refiner, but a poor modeling base due to the insensitive response of shive content to changes in processing conditions. The Bauer 187 performed well as a deshive refiner and model base. A strong relationship was found between post-treatment von Alfthan values and Bauer 187 control variables. A best model of Bauer 187 deshive refining was selected by the total square error criterion. That model involves a complex relationship of plate <b>gap,</b> <b>stock</b> consistency, and throughput rate, but, in general, reducing plate <b>gap</b> and increasing <b>stock</b> consistency reduces post-treatment shive contents. Conditions which optimized the efficiency of Bauer 187 deshive refining depended upon the desired shive content of processed pulp. Shive contents typical of industrially deshived pulp were most efficiently obtained by Bauer 187 deshive refining at 1. 5 mm plate gap, 1. 2 kg/minute throughput rate, and 12 percent consistency. The effects of deshive refining on pulp washing and strength development potential were also investigated. Chemical recovery from high yield kraft pulp was improved by Bauer 187 deshive refining. Washing improvements became more pronounced as pulp yield was increased. Pulp strength at common levels of CSF and sheet bulk generally benefited from Bauer 187 deshive refining. Strength differences between deshived and undeshived pulps were attributable to differences in the amount of strength development beating necessary to achieve specified bulks and freenesses...|$|R

We calculate the term structure of inflation uncertainty in New Keynesian models when the monetary authority adopts the optimal policy. When the monetary policy rules are modified to include some weight on a price path, the economy achieves equilibria with substantially lower long-run inflation risk.

This paper aims at contributing to the literature on early warning indicator exercises for asset price development. Using a sample of 17 industrialised OECD countries and the euro area over the period 1969 Q 1 - 2011 Q 2, an asset price composite indicator incorporating developments in both stock and house price markets is constructed. The latter is then further developed {{in order to identify}} periods that can be characterised as asset price booms and busts. The subsequent empirical analysis is based on an ordered logit-type approach incorporating several monetary, financial and real variables.

40|$|Futures {{have been}} {{recently}} introduced to cater {{the needs of}} investors and fill up the existing <b>gaps</b> in <b>stock</b> market. Studies show that, in the long-run, futures introduction {{does not have any}} effect on the spot market; however, in the short-run volatility in the spot market increases; Paudyal et al. (2005). Harris (1989) finds that increased volatility in the spot market is not solely due to the futures introduction. Alexakis (2007) substantiates the stability of indices after futures introduction. This study is set about to understand the impact of stock futures introduction on the Indian spot market. This study makes an initial attempt to capture the same by considering a small sample of 20 scrips, segregated as small and large caps, listed on NSE for the period August 2005 to May 2008. Using Hoadley Options, volatility modeled by GARCH (1, 1) is estimated. Considering both volume and volatility, mixed evidences are witnessed. Futures introduction has some stabilizing effect on large caps. For small caps, increase in volatility is accompanied by increase in volume, thereby, improving the liquidity of the scrips. ...|$|R

This production function accommodates differences in substitution elasticities between countries. Indeed, the empirical evidence shows that real wage elasticities of labour demand differ widely across countries. The national output gaps constructed turn out to significantly explain future changes in inflation. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that an aggregate European output gap significantly precedes aggregate European inflation, as well as inflation in the individual EU countries. These findings imply that an aggregate European output gap may serve as an inflation indicator for the preparation of a single European <b>monetary</b> policy. output <b>gap,</b> potential output, inflation, Phillips curve...|$|R

As the economic recovery takes hold, the question arises of what the increased liquidity, through higher money growth, portends for the near future.

Current evidence suggests a rebound in economic growth and inflationary pressure unless the Bank begins to rein in money growth.

This paper explains why managers' ability to use inside information to repurchase stock at a bargain price is likely to systematically transfer value from public investors. In addition, tying cash distributions to the <b>gap</b> between the <b>stock</b> price and its actual value is likely to distort managers' payout, disclosure, and investment decisions, further reducing shareholder returns. The paper also proposes requiring firms to publicly disclose in advance the repurchase orders transmitted to their brokers.

To do this, stock material is removed along the barrel channel to leave a slight <b>gap</b> between the <b>stock</b> and the barrel; this is called free floating the barrel. With some designs, pressure bedding is preferred, where a {{single point of contact}} remains between stock and barrel near the forend. In both these cases, bedding the action is required to provide support for the floating or pressure bedded barrel. Since the action ends up supporting the mass of the barrel, a poor stock to action fit will result in unacceptable shifting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} recent {{events in the}} euro area to discuss the serious gaps in the fiscal {{architecture}} of the European Economic and <b>Monetary</b> Union.

The failure of preventive instruments made the absence of crisis management and resolution capabilities in the euro area highly problematic, exposing the union to a meaningful risk of breakup.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of macroeconomic policies depends on adequate business cycle approximation. Given that potential output and the output gap (the difference between actual and potential output) {{are not directly}} observable, their values need to be estimated using alternative statistical, structural, and combined techniques. In this paper the Hodrick-Prescott filter and the Cobb-Douglass production function has been applied on the Slovak conditions. The pross and coins of both methods are analysed. The Hodrick-Prescott filter does not capture the structural changes, which were significant especially {{in the first half}} of analysed period. Thus the Cobb-Douglass production function seems to be more appropriate. It enables to detect particular factors of potential output growth as technological progress, capital and labour. Despite of potential shortcomings, this approach is still widely used by international institutions, governments and researchers. <b>monetary</b> policy, output <b>gap,</b> potential output, Hodrick-Prescot filter, Cobb-Douglas production funct...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the individual determinants of unemployment in Hungary. It seeks to understand the reasons why Hungarian women were, in 1992, less likely to be unemployed than their male counterparts. It estimates first, the probability of being in the stock of unemployment and secondly, one particular inflow into unemployment. Adapting standard discrimination analysis to the case of binary variables, the paper decomposes the differential in average unemployment rates by gender. The paper shows that differences in individual endowments account for very little of the gender <b>gap</b> in the <b>stock</b> of unemployment. On the other hand, slightly less than half the unemployment gap could come from differences in one digit occupations and sectors of employment between male and female employees. ...|$|R
40|$|For the {{successful}} conduct of monetary policy {{the central bank}} needs reliable indicators of the monetary policy stance. A recently often advocated one is {{the gap between the}} real, market and the natural rate of interest. In this article we estimate the historical time series of the natural rate of interest using a structural vector autoregressive model. This method returns plausible results and thus seems to be well designed for the estimation of the natural rate of interest. We show that the natural rate exhibits quite substantial variability over time, of comparable magnitude to the variability of the real interest rate. We also find that it is a procyclical variable. We conclude that the gap between the natural and real market interest rates can be considered a useful, although not perfect, indicator of the stance of monetary policy.

This paper contributes to the literature with an empirical analysis of the period from 1993 to 1998 that encompasses eleven EMU countries. In particular, Taylor type interest rate rules are estimated with monthly national data to find that, despite certain similarities and exceptions, the rule followed by each country is distinct and differs substantially from the standard Taylor rule. However, for most countries, the parameter estimates reflect the principles proclaimed by the monetary policy authorities and, in addition, it is shown that in most cases the estimated rules reproduce the policy setting quite closely.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the monetary policymaker’s joint problem of model estimation {{and the design}} of a policy rule in the face of uncertainty regarding the process of structural change in the economy. Unobserved structural change is modeled through time variation in the natural rates of interest and unemployment. I show that certainty-equivalent optimal policies perform poorly when there is uncertainty about the natural rate processes. I then examine the properties of combined estimation methods and policy rules that are robust to this type of model uncertainty. I find that weighted sample means are robust estimators of natural rates for the purpose of setting policy. The optimal policy under uncertainty incorporates a significant degree of policy inertia and a muted response to the perceived unemployment gap; by comparison, the certainty-equivalent optimized policy in this model exhibits little policy inertia and a more aggressive response to the unemployment <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy; Econometric models...|$|R

The general features of the model can be summarised as follows : Calvo style nominal price rigidities, perfect exchange rate pass-through, complete international asset markets, rule of thumb price setters and distortionary taxation. The parameter estimates show that the monetary authority reacts to inflation but only weakly reacts to the output gap. The degree of interest rate smoothing is high.

We develop an original methodology to measure such a deviation, and we employed it as argument in an augmented interest rate rule. The empirical evidence suggests the following description of the European central banker: he significantly reacts to {{financial asset}} prices, by raising (lowering) the ECB main interest rate when stock prices are over(under) -evaluated; he is partisan of a wait-and-see policy, reacting only when the price gap is quite important; and he seems rather little conservative, believing that asset prices are driven mainly by nonfundamental factors...|$|R

This is important as generating forecasts on a quarterly basis is a key part of the process used by the Bank of England. The forecast for inflation is made public in the Inflation Report while the output gap forecast is not. Second, we use a random coefficient method of estimation in which the parameters of the interest rate rule are allowed, but not required, to be different across members. Third, we find evidence of some heterogeneity in the intercept, a measure of experience on the MPC and the interest rate smoothing parameter, but no significant differences in the members' reaction to the forecasts of inflation and the output <b>gap.</b> <b>Monetary</b> Policy; Voting Patterns...|$|R

The paper, therefore, analyzes four issues on the impact of the globalization upon the mechanisms of monetary transmission and arrives at the following findings.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether lack {{of familiarity with}} the companies {{in the stock market}} index may contribute to a gender <b>gap</b> in <b>stock</b> market participation and risk taking. We consider the Netherlands because recent reforms have reduced the generosity of mandatory pension and social security arrangements and created the need for many employees to decide on how to allocate (pension) savings. Moreover, the gender gap in pensions in the Netherlands is above that of the OECD average. We construct a «pink» portfolio with stocks that are supposed to be more familiar to women (based on ads in widely read women magazines) and a «blue» one with stocks from the market index (AEX). We then ask members of the CentERpanel how they would allocate a certain amount of pension wealth between government bonds and a stock portfolio, whereby half of respondents, randomly selected, are given the pink portfolio and half the blue one as an alternative to bonds. Based on a set of limited dependent variable models, we find that familiarity is correlated to decision time for women, but it affects risk-taking only for women over 60. We do find a strong response order effect on risk taking, which moreover is larger for women than for men, and interpret the latter as reflecting a gender gap in confidence...|$|R
30|$|Two of the {{companies}} also approach this challenge by transfer-the-problem up- or downstream. This means, {{in the case of}} the inbound flows of an MTS company, that the suppliers are tasked with minimising their delivery times; in the case of an MTO company’s outbound flow, the customer needs to accept the longer lead times. The inbound flow of two other companies, one operating according to MTS and the other to MTO, approach this issue in the sourcing domain. By selecting suppliers that are geographically closer or sourcing generic components so as to expand the lead time gap, they try to mitigate the impact of slower sailing speeds on the lead time. The outbound flow of two other companies, both MTO, take on this challenge in the logistics and manufacturing domain. This is achieved largely by locating production facilities closer to the markets they supply in order to reduce the lead time to their customers. Finally, one of {{the companies}} also aims to reduce lead time by redesigning their product range so as to be able to assemble a large range of products from a handful of generic components. This enables the company, which delivers its products according to MTO, to expand the lead time <b>gap</b> by <b>stocking</b> production facilities closer to markets with generic components based on sales forecasts.

We run a discrete choice regression that relates these observed indicators of policy stance to major trends of macroeconomic and financial developments, which are represented by common factors extracted from {{a large number of}} variables. The predicted value of the estimated model can then be interpreted as the implicit policy stance of the PBoC. In a second step, we estimate how much of the variation in the PBoC's implicit stance can be explained by measures of its policy objectives on inflation, growth and financial stability. We find that deviations of CPI inflation from an implicit target and deviations of broad money growth from the announced targets figured significantly in PBoC's policy changes, but not output <b>gaps.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy, People's Bank of China, qualitative response models, large factor models...|$|R
