2500|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and steering knuckle, the rear <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> uses a forged aluminum upper control arm, lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum. [...] The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models. The brakes {{have been changed}} from the more expensive Brembo racing brakes to Nissan branded brakes which are manufactured by Akebono.|$|E
2500|$|In the RS4 suspension, a fluid {{hydraulic}} {{linkage between}} diagonally opposing {{front and rear}} suspension dampers (left front to right rear, and vice versa) is used to counteract vehicle pitch and roll. [...] Lightweight magnesium/aluminium alloy <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> arms (four arm with virtual steering axis up front, and trapezoidal arm with unequal length track control arms at the rear) locate each hub/brake/roadwheel assembly in a controllable fashion, whilst minimising unsprung masses. [...] Lightweight hollow tubular anti-roll bars are standard front and rear. [...] Compared to standard B7 A4 models, the RS4 features a [...] lower ride height. [...] An optional [...] "Sports Suspension Plus" [...] lowers the car by a further , and marginally further stiffens the damper rates.|$|E

50|$|Rear {{wheel drive}} {{vehicles}} today frequently use a fairly complex fully independent, <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> {{to locate the}} rear wheels securely while providing decent ride quality.|$|E
50|$|It takes {{a minimum}} of two links per wheel in a MacPherson strut-style {{suspension}} and {{a minimum of}} three links per wheel in a <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the difference in powertrain with the Y34 Cedric/Gloria, the Y34 M45 has a completely different instrument panel design, similar to the F50 Q45. Other differences includes a completely different rear <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> design. The Y34 Cedric/Gloria's rear <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> design is similar to Z32 300ZX, and S14/S15 Silvia/200SX/240SX where the rear spring is mounted on the strut. The rear suspension design on the Y34 M45 {{is very much like}} the rear suspension design on the Z33 350Z, where the spring is mounted independent of the shock/strut, and sits directly on the lower arm, in a spring cup.|$|E
50|$|Development {{was shared}} with its smaller brother, the roadster-only Boxster which {{appeared}} {{around the same}} time, including the front suspension, much of the interior, and the engine, {{all of which were}} enlarged for the 996. However the <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> derived from the preceding 993, was different.|$|R

25|$|The Z1 {{is unique}} for its plastic body panels and {{vertically}} sliding doors which {{drop into the}} door sills. It {{is one of the}} first BMWs to use a <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The sole drivetrain specification is the 2.5Litre straight-six engine and 5-speed manual transmission from the E30 325i.|$|R
50|$|The S8, {{like its}} related A8, utilises a <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> layout front and rear, with {{pressurised}} air springs. However, for the S8, the effective spring and damper rates are noticeably firmer, along with re-engineered suspension mounts.|$|E
5000|$|The rear <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is remarkably}} similar to the [...] "E multi-link" [...] found in the HC platform. Although also similar to Ford's own design, Mazda {{engineers}} {{said this is a}} revival of the [...] "E multi-link".|$|E
50|$|The Z3 {{is based}} on the E36/5 3 Series Compact chassis. Rear {{suspension}} is the semi trailing arm design (from the E30 3 Series), instead of the <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> design used {{by the rest of the}} E36 models.|$|E
25|$|All Group-A {{race cars}} were {{fitted with a}} TRD-sourced torque-vectoring {{mechanical}} limited-slip differential with 50:50 left:right lockup on full throttle. TRD was also responsible for the thick rear-anti squat tram-rods which was integral to the <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension</b> setup to control rear squat under hard acceleration and launching.|$|R
50|$|The Z1 {{is unique}} for its plastic body panels and {{vertically}} sliding doors which {{drop into the}} door sills. It {{is one of the}} first BMWs to use a <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The sole drivetrain specification is the 2.5 Litre straight-six engine and 5-speed manual transmission from the E30 325i.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, however, {{it had become}} clear that the Sierra {{had fallen out of}} step technologically against modern Japanese rivals which offered {{multi-valve}} engines and <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> All of these features appeared on the Sierra's replacement, the front-wheel-drive Mondeo, which was unveiled at the end of 1992 and launched the following March.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd {{generation}} BMW 1 Series range comprises 3-door hatchback (model code F21) and 5-door hatchback (F20) models. Like its E87 predecessor, {{it uses a}} longitudinally-mounted engine, aluminum <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> and a {{rear-wheel drive}} chassis (however some models are available with all-wheel drive).|$|E
50|$|The E36/5 {{made use}} of the older {{semi-trailing}} arm rear axle, {{as opposed to the}} E36's Z-Axle <b>Multi-link</b> <b>suspension.</b> As the trailing arm design was smaller, it allowed for a lower trunk floor height, fold-down rear seats, and an exterior undermounted compact spare tire.|$|E
50|$|LaFerrari uses {{a carbon}} fibre {{monocoque}} structure developed by Ferrari's F1 technical director Rory Byrne, with a claimed 27 percent more torsional rigidity and 22 percent more beam stiffness than the Enzo. It has a double wishbone suspension {{in the front}} and a <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} utilises a {{front engine}} transaxle design with engines and gearboxes mounted transversly on a subframe. Only straight 5 engines were offered.A front subframe and front MacPherson struts were used and either Volvo's patented Deltalink rear axle on FWD models or Volvo's <b>Multi-Link</b> rear <b>suspension</b> with an independent rear subframe on AWD models.|$|R
50|$|The E36 was {{the first}} 3 Series to be offered in a {{hatchback}} body style. It {{was also the first}} 3 Series to be available with a 6-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a 5-speed automatic transmission and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension</b> was also a significant upgrade compared with previous generations of 3 Series.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz C111 was {{a series}} of {{experimental}} automobiles produced by Mercedes-Benz in the 1960s and 1970s. The company was experimenting with new engine technologies, including Wankel engines, diesel engines, and turbochargers, and used the basic C111 platform as a testbed. Other experimental features included <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> gull-wing doors and a luxurious interior with leather trim and air conditioning.|$|R
5000|$|Handling {{improvements}} include <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension,</b> firmer shocks and springs, {{front strut}} brace, and a rear sway bar. A large F40 style rear spoiler and aero bodykit with Autech indicators are also fitted. An [...] "Autech Version K's MF-T" [...] badge and sticker {{can be found}} on the boot.|$|E
50|$|Benefit of {{independent}} suspension:Multi-link suspension allows the auto designer {{the ability to}} incorporate both good ride and good handling in the same vehicle.In its simplest form, <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> is orthogonal—i.e., {{it is possible to}} alter one parameter in the suspension at a time, without affecting anything else. This is in direct contrast to a double wishbone suspension, where moving a hardpoint or changing a bushing compliance will affect two or more parameters.Advantages also extend to off-road driving. A <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> allows the vehicle to flex more; this means simply that the suspension is able to move more easily to conform to the varying angles of off-road driving. Multi-link-equipped vehicles are ideally suited for sports such as desert racing. In desert racing, the use of a good sway bar is needed to counter body roll.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is a new}} double-joint <b>multi-link</b> <b>suspension</b> with a forged aluminum {{upper arm}} is secured at two points, which ensures all movements are mirrored from the lower arm. The double-joint design reduces the necessary height of the suspension system, as placement is lower than a traditional single-joint setup.|$|E
50|$|The three-door {{hatchback}} debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It {{was offered}} only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6 L (1588 cc) I4 engine which produced 130 hp (97 kW). The suspension consisted of MacPherson struts both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front <b>suspension</b> and a <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> featuring Nishiboric passive steering.|$|R
50|$|The S13 {{was one of}} {{the first}} uses of Nissan's <b>multi-link</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> the {{technology}} of which was previewed in concept cars in previous years, such as the Nissan MID4. It also offered a four-wheel steering system for the first time, known as HICAS-II. In 1990, HICAS-II was updated and renamed SuperHICAS. The S13 also saw the introduction of a viscous-type limited slip differential for some models.|$|R
50|$|Nissan had {{deliberately}} {{targeted the}} car at the European market. The Primera saw Nissan's <b>multi-link</b> front <b>suspension</b> applied to front-wheel drive for the first time. The 2.0 litre gasoline engine received a power upgrade in 1992, which gave the then eZX, (later renamed the eGT) 150 bhp from the standard 2.0 litre engine and {{a top speed of}} around 219 km/h (or 137 mph).|$|R
