40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} Visual <b>Merchandise</b> <b>Display</b> (VMD) can enhance {{consumers}} intentions to buy luxury brands and this influence is stronger for the consumers with higher cultural capital (CC) {{than those with}} lower CC. Prior research in store atmospherics has suggested that consumers make inferences about a product, a store or a seller based on high-image or low-image store environment cues. Contemporary research in the luxury retailing literature explores qualitatively, the role of of museocological product presentation techniques in building and sustaining a luxury brand image. However, the extant literature does not consider that people can differ {{in their ability to}} decode or appreciate such display tecniques. This thesis builds on the emerging research in luxury retailing by investigating (empirically and quantitatively in four studies) the impact of VMD on consumer purchase intentions of luxury brands as well as the moderating role of the consumers CC. Furthermore, it attempts to explain this effect by adopting a consumer-style-of-processing approach, and it explores whether the consumers CC can determine their holistic or analytical way of processing of visual information in a retail context...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} the role that visual measures of attention to product and information and price display signage have on purchase intention. The authors assessed the effect of visual attention to the product, information or price sign on purchase intention, as measured by likelihood to buy. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used eye–tracking technology to collect data from Australian and US garden centre customers, who viewed eight plant displays in which the signs had been altered to show either price or supplemental information (16 images total). The authors compared the role of visual attention to price and information sign, and the role of visual attention to the product when either sign was present on likelihood to buy. Findings – Overall, providing product information on a sign without price elicited higher likelihood to buy than providing a sign with price. The authors found a positive relationship between visual attention to price on the display sign and likelihood to buy, but an inverse relationship between visual attention to information and likelihood to buy. Research limitations/implications – An understanding of the attention–capturing power of <b>merchandise</b> <b>display</b> elements, especially signs, has practical significance. The findings will assist retailers in creating more effective and efficient display signage content, for example, featuring the product information more prominently than the price. The study was conducted on a minimally packaged product, live plants, which may reduce the ability to generalize findings to other product types. Practical implications – The findings will assist retailers in creating more effective and efficient display signage content. The study used only one product category (plants) which may reduce the ability to generalize findings to other product types. Originality/value – The study is one of the first to use eye–tracking in a macro–level, holistic investigation of the attention–capturing value of display signage information and its relationship to likelihood to buy. Researchers, for the first time, now have the ability to empirically test the degree to which attention and decision–making are linked...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Storefront mosques are a unique, {{emerging}} type of {{vernacular architecture}} {{that has been}} adapted into sacred space. A typical commercial storefront is a first-floor space facing on the street, its entrance typically flanked by glass windows for <b>merchandise</b> <b>display.</b> Muslim immigrants, however, are transforming many old commercial buildings into storefront mosques across the city and planners and scholars know almost nothing about them. Buildings such as warehouses, pool halls, defunct industrial structures, and former churches are adapted and staged into storefront mosques. Tucked into commercial corridors, storefront mosques are places of real meaning, mundane spaces transformed into places of peace, refuge and prayer. This study identifies the types of commercial structures that are being transformed into storefront mosques. Multiple methods are used to describe these Muslim spaces: field observation, a photo essay, annotated diagrams and archival data. These descriptions illustrate how these structures are being adapted. More generally, through interviews and story telling, the societal tensions that Muslim immigrants and refugees experience living in diaspora are revealed. These tensions are reflected and negotiated {{through the process of}} storefront mosque building. Three themes arise that exhibit dual tensions. These themes are: sacred vs. profane, temporary vs. permanent and insider vs. outsider. The storefront mosque becomes a place where larger social issues are revealed and worked through. Three case studies in Seattle are presented: the Oromo Cultural Center, the Al-Noor Islamic Center and the Mahmood mosque. By looking at the particular, this study reveals observations that are generally applicable to the phenomenon of storefront mosques. The case study approach provides an opportunity for a deep investigation and development of an explanation for dynamic interaction. It also allows us to understand a particular phenomenon in relation to its context. This dynamic interaction is the process of immigrants and refugees combining secular and sacred uses to create enclaves in the neighborhoods that they reside in to help ease and mitigate the experience of learning to become Americans. The study concludes with recommendations for urban planners that can help better facilitate the incorporation of storefront mosques into the fabric of the city. Recommendations include combining secular and sacred uses by understanding lived religion, re-framing ideas of highest and best use, and the role of improvisation in the planning process...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to develop a theory about taste in {{appearance}} and to investigate if cultural capital, proposed by Bourdieu (1984), is a relevant concept in explaining appearance-related consumption. Taste has been studied in two disciplines. Philosophers defined taste as an aesthetic aptitude or capacity to discover beauty from works of art. Sociologists conceptualized taste as a cultivated disposition in the guise of an innate disposition in a broad range of cultural products. While philosophers endeavored to conceptualized taste in relation to beauty, sociologists associated taste with social acceptance or attractiveness.;Phenomenological interviews were conducted with 16 participants from upper-middle and middle class backgrounds who lived in three Midwestern cities. Information about participants 2 ̆ 7 demographic and family backgrounds was also collected. Participants were selected through a snowball sampling procedure to have varied background characteristics. A constant comparative approach to qualitative data analysis was conducted to find important themes and explore differences among participants related to their backgrounds (Strauss, 1987).;The content of the interviews indicated that taste in appearance is a cultivated disposition to direct consumption activities. Taste included preferences for putting together outfits as well as for particular aesthetic elements. Participants described taste in terms of how they related particular things to themselves (self-concept) and why they liked particular things (motives). Participants 2 ̆ 7 preferences indicated their struggle with ambivalence about how much they wanted to fit in but remain somewhat different from others and how much they wanted to keep their appearance up-to-date and in fashion. Taste was actualized through the exercise of appearance-specific motives and efficient appearance management strategies, including optimizing the use of given resources and negotiating conflicts among preferences and resources.;With respect to evaluation of taste, participants evaluated taste as a sum of the appearance and the consumption skills of a person, because taste was communicated through presentation of one 2 ̆ 7 s appearance. Evaluation included judging how well appearance embodies an actor, how motives in clothing practice were successfully pursued and how an actor successfully managed constraints and balanced ambivalent factors.;Level of cultural capital possessed by the participants differentially shaped social actors 2 ̆ 7 experiences of appearance consumption. The resources of cultural capital, including upbringing, education, and occupation (Bourdieu, 1984), provided participants with an aptitude for involvement in appearance consumption, including sensitivity to dressing appropriately, capacity to construct and communicate meanings, and opportunities and refinement of dressing practices. Among the participants, about half had background characteristics indicating fairly high level of cultural capital, and the other half had a middle range of cultural capital. For those with higher level of cultural capital, manifested taste was constructed with a higher degree of complexity than among participants with a middle level of cultural capital. High cultural capital individuals showed greater evidence of aesthetic involvement through clothing practices.;The findings have practical implications for apparel marketers. Knowledge of levels of cultural capital of target customers will help define strategies for advertising, store layout and <b>merchandise</b> <b>display.</b> The findings have useful implications for marketing of products other than clothing...|$|E
