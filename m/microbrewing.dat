25|$|Montana is a {{relative}} hub of beer <b>microbrewing,</b> ranking third {{in the nation in}} number of craft breweries per capita in 2011. There are significant industries for lumber and mineral extraction; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, talc, and vermiculite. Ecotaxes on resource extraction are numerous. A 1974 state severance tax on coal (which varied from 20 to 30 percent) was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609 (1981).|$|E

Schiff also proposed eliminating zoning constraints against establishments serving alcohol within 300 feet of a house of worship outside of the downtown area.

500|$|In 1862, German {{immigrant}} Henry Weinhard {{founded a}} brewery in Portland. [...] By the early 1880s {{it had become}} the Northwest's largest brewery.

[...] He died in 1904, but the company continued to do well, making it through prohibition by brewing soft drinks and merging with Arnold Blitz, a local competitor. [...] Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company in 1979, and then again to the Miller Brewing Company in 1999.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of market place and {{consumer}} research for hard apple cider. The objectives of the research were to determine potential demand for and constraints to the supply of hard apple cider in Michigan. The research was undertaken using on-site and focus group interviews of managers of <b>microbrews,</b> brew-pubs, restaurants and retailers. The research revealed much enthusiasm over HC market potential among purveyors interviewed, particularly among microbrewers, brew-pubs, and specialty retailers. Respondents estimated the potential value of Michigan hard cider market to be relatively small but significant-from 1 - 5 % of purveyors' alcohol sales, and as high as 20 % in some cases. Potential hard cider consumers are diverse and include 1) traditional <b>microbrew</b> connoisseurs, 2) young, adventurous drinkers who are driving the "malternative" trend, and 3) the "significant others" and other companions of <b>microbrew</b> connoisseurs who seek {{an alternative to the}} heavier beers served in <b>microbrews.</b> While <b>microbrew</b> connoisseurs are likely to gravitate toward a more traditional, drier cider, "malternative" drinkers and the "significant others" are likely to prefer a sweeter product. Compared to other respondents, <b>microbrews</b> showed particular enthusiasm for producing and marketing hard cider. While <b>microbrews</b> and brewpubs would market the product on tap, restaurants and retailers will more likely market a bottled product. The primary impediment to consumer acceptance of the product is a lack of familiarity, and numerous promotional efforts that could overcome these constraints were suggested. Demand for hard cider is likely to be somewhat seasonal, however there are numerous hard cider themes and products that might serve to mitigate this seasonality. While strong enthusiasm for the marketability of a Michigan-brewed product was expressed by respondents, an organic or "all-natural" product was not felt to have potential due to both demand and supply constraints. The primary constraints to supply of hard cider in general are the cost and availability of ingredients, as well as regulatory and taxation issues. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

50|$|The <b>microbrewing</b> {{movement}} {{began in}} the United Kingdom in the 1970s although traditional artisanal brewing existed in Europe for centuries and subsequently spread to other countries. As the movement grew and some breweries expanded their production and distribution, the more encompassing concept of craft brewing emerged. A brewpub is a pub that brews its own beer for sale on the premises.|$|E
50|$|Brewpubs {{subsequently}} resurged, {{particularly with}} the rise of the Firkin pub chain, most of whose pubs brewed on the premises, running to over one hundred at peak. However, that chain was sold and eventually its pubs ceased brewing their own beer. The resulting decline in brewpubs was something of a boon to other forms of <b>microbrewing,</b> as it led to an availability of trained craft brewers and brewing equipment.|$|E
