5000|$|On 11 August, {{two months}} after the turbulence, the People's Bank of China devalued the RMB - by 1.86 percent to CN¥6.2298 per US dollar. [...] A lower renminbi (RMB) [...] "makes China’s exports more {{competitive}} in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country’s blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive." [...] On 14 August, the central bank devalued it again to CN¥6.3975 per US dollar. In August there was speculation about the causes of the devaluation of the yuan and the changes in the Chinese economy in 2015, including the [...] "growth in its services sector rather than heavy industry." [...] By mid-January 2016, an article in The Economist argued that the strains on the yuan indicated a problem with China's politics. However, a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency (IEA) argued that the risk was [...] "overplayed".

40|$|For much of {{monetary}} history, inflation targeting was unnecessary. 1 There {{was no need}} to worry about constraining the central bank’s inflationary proclivities because no central bank existed. The quantity of basic money was constrained by the mints ’ commitment to full-bodied gold and silver coinage (at least where the mint-owners lacked monopoly status or chose not to exploit that status through debasement). The quantity of bank-issued money was constrained by the commercial banks ’ commitment to gold- and silver-redeemability for banknotes and deposits. Together these commitments prevented excessive monetary expansion and thereby price inflation. 2 Today (since 1971) the commitments are gone, and a substitute is needed. Constraining Central-Bank Discretion Inflation targeting has been much discussed in recent years as a proposal for constraining the Federal Reserve’s monetary policymaking. As proposed constaints on central banking go, it is relatively weak. Inflation targeting doesn’t abolish the central bank, and—at least in the well-known version recommended by Bernanke et al. (1999) —doesn’t even fasten a strict rule on it. In both the Bernanke version and in the versions actually practiced in other developed countries, the central bank authorizes inflation within a range of positive rates, typically 1 to 3 percent. At the <b>midpoint</b> <b>rate</b> of 2 percent, inflation is higher than experienced historically under commodity-standard regimes, and is too high to promote optimal money-holding.

50|$|Midpoint's {{patented}} engine matches {{currency pair}} orders on a reciprocal basis by harnessing the peer-to-peer {{capabilities of the}} internet. In simpler terms, if User A in the UK wishes to purchase US dollars for pounds and User B in the USA wishes to purchase pounds for dollars, both orders are matched at {{the midpoint of the}} prevailing interbank exchange rate. The same principle applies to more sophisticated environment where more than a single party and counter-party pair are involved. For a 3-way group or even higher orders, consider an example where User X wishes to purchase US dollars for pounds, User Y wishes to purchase pounds for Swiss francs, and User Z wishes to purchase Swiss francs for dollars, Midpoint's patented technology performs multilateral netting for all three trades at the prevailing interbank market <b>midpoint</b> <b>rates</b> eliminating the need for a FX broker.|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} different systolic cardiac indices {{to describe}} {{left and right}} ventricular dysfunction in cirrhotic patients before liver transplantation. 			Methods: In this case-control study, eighty-one consecutive individuals with the confirmed hepatic cirrhosis and candidate for liver transplantation in the Imam Khomeini Hospital between March 2008 and March 2010 were selected. Thirty-two age and gender cross-matched healthy volunteers were also selected as the control group. A detailed two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was obtained in all patients and controls performed by the same operator {{on the day of}} admission. 			Results: Dimensions of both left and right atriums as well as left ventricular end-diastolic volume and basal right ventricular dimension in the cirrhotic group were significantly higher than control group. Left ventricular end-systolic dimensions as well as aortic annulus diameter were not different between the two study groups. Left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral, isovolumic pre-ejection time, isovolumic relaxation time, stroke volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, IVCT+IVRT+ET, systolic velocity of tricuspid annulus, systolic velocity of basal segment of RV free wall, systolic velocity of basal segment of septal wall, peak strain of septal margin (base), peak strain of septal margin (midpoint), peak strain of lateral margin (<b>midpoint),</b> strain <b>rate</b> of septal margin (base), strain rate of septal margin (<b>midpoint),</b> strain <b>rate</b> of lateral margin (base), strain rate of lateral margin (midpoint), Tei index (left and right ventricles), systolic time interval and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion were higher in cirrhotic group, significantly, (P< 0. 05). Left ventricular ejection time and systolic velocity of mid segment of lateral wall were lower in cirrhotic group, significantly, (P< 0. 05). 			 		 	 Conclusion: In this study, the effects of liver on heart were volume overload, hyperdynamic state and systolic dysfunction in cirrhotic patients. These effects were due to chamber enlargement and we cannot use the most of cardiac indices for evaluation systolic function in cirrhotic patients. So, we suggest that systolic time interval and Tei index are useful indices in evaluation of systolic function in cirrhotic patients...|$|R
50|$|Midpoint's {{peer-to-peer}} engine directly matches {{businesses and}} individuals with offsetting currency requirements {{resulting in the}} elimination of the ‘spread or margin’ component from all transactions. By doing so, users avoid the cost of the bid-ask spread levied by traditional banks and brokers - often from 2%-5% and instead uses the midpoint of the real-time interbank market rate. For its services, the company charges a single flat fee depending on the amount of the transaction. The foreign exchange rate is set at the time the currency match is made, and the rate used is always the midpoint of the prevailing Interbank rate. The technology eliminates the spread imposed by market makers and the need for a middleman or broker. This mechanism help prevents discrimination against smaller sized transactions as all users receive the same <b>midpoint</b> interbank <b>rate</b> at the point of transaction. Despite its nomenclature, peer-to-peer foreign currency exchange should {{not to be confused with}} P2P cryptocurrencies, digital or alternative 'currencies' such as bitcoin that rely on decentralised public ledgers and blockchain cryptography as a medium of exchange.|$|R
40|$|Although beta-sheets {{represent}} a sizable {{fraction of the}} secondary structure found in proteins, the forces guiding the formation of beta-sheets are still not well understood. Here we examine the folding of a small, all beta-sheet protein, the E. coli major cold shock protein CspA, using both equilibrium and kinetic methods. The equilibrium denaturation of CspA is reversible and displays a single transition between folded and unfolded states. The kinetic traces of the unfolding and refolding of CspA studied by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy are monoexponential and thus also consistent with a two-state model. In the absence of denaturant, CspA refolds very fast with a time constant of 5 ms. The unfolding of CspA is also rapid, and at urea concentrations above the denaturation <b>midpoint,</b> the <b>rate</b> of unfolding is largely independent of urea concentration. This suggests that the transition state ensemble more closely resembles the native state in terms of solvent accessibility than the denatured state. Based {{on the model of}} a compact transition state and on an unusual structural feature of CspA, a solvent-exposed cluster of aromatic side chains, we propose a novel folding mechanism for CspA. We have also investigated the possible complications that may arise from attaching polyhistidine affinity tags to the carboxy and amino termini of CspA...|$|R

Let ρ(x,t) be the {{probability}} that the edge with midpoint x=(x_ 1,x_ 2) is open at time t and let n(p,t) be the distance at which edges are open with probability p at time t. We show that with probability tending to 1 as t →∞: (i) the cluster containing the origin C_ 0 (t) is contained in the square of radius n(p_c-ϵ,t), and (ii) the cluster fills the square of radius n(p_c+ϵ,t) with the density of points near x being close to θ(ρ(x,t)) where θ(p) is the percolation probability when bonds are open with probability p on Z^ 2. Results of Nolin suggest that if N=n(p_c,t) then the boundary fluctuations of C_ 0 (t) are of size N^ 4 / 7. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of homesickness varies greatly, {{depending on the}} population studied and the way homesickness is measured. One way to conceptualize homesickness prevalence is {{as a function of}} severity. Nearly all people miss something about home when they are away, so the absolute {{prevalence of}} homesickness is close to 100%, mostly in a mild form. Roughly 20% of university students and children at summer camp rate themselves at or above the <b>midpoint</b> on numerical <b>rating</b> scales of homesickness severity. And only 5-7% of students and campers report intense homesickness associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, in adverse or painful environments, such as the hospital or the battlefield, intense homesickness is far more prevalent. In one study, 50% of children scored themselves at or above the midpoint on a numerical homesickness intensity scale (compared to 20% of children at summer camp). Soldiers report even more intense homesickness, sometimes to the point of suicidal misery. Naturally, aversive environmental elements, such as the trauma associated with war, exacerbate homesickness and other mental health problems.|$|R
40|$|There are {{multiple}} breeds of beef cattle available to utilize in breeding systems to maximize production and economics. Calving difficulty (dystocia) {{is a significant}} cost to beef production and is more prevalent in first-calf heifers. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate genetic parameters and breed differences for calving difficulty and birth weight as a first step towards the development of across-breed adjustment factors for calving difficulty. Two models were employed to analyze birth weight (BWT) and calving difficulty (CD) recorded on 4, 579 first parity females from the Germplasm Evaluation program at the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC). Both bivariate animal models fit CD and BWT either using CD scores based on USMARC scoring system (Model 1) or CD assigned as Z scores based on the <b>midpoint</b> incidence <b>rate</b> (Model 2). Heritability estimates (SE) for BWT direct, CD direct, BWT maternal and CD maternal for model 1 were 0. 35 (0. 10), 0. 29 (0. 10), 0. 15 (0. 08), and 0. 14 (0. 08), respectively. Heritability estimates for BWT direct, CD direct, and BWT maternal for model 2 were similar to model 1. The estimate of CD maternal from model 2 was 0. 13 (0. 08). Genetic correlation estimates were positive between BWT direct and CD direct (0. 63 ± 0. 17; model 1) and (0. 64 ± 0. 17; model 2). All other genetic correlations were not significant. Bos Indicus influenced breeds tended to have the largest estimates of BWT direct. Calving difficulty direct breed effects ranged from - 1. 01 to 7. 50 for model 1 and from - 1. 06 to 7. 36 for model 2. Calving difficulty maternal breed effects ranged from - 1. 55 to 5. 27 for model 1 and from - 1. 55 to 5. 25 for model 2. Diverse biological types of cattle have different effects on both birth weight and calving difficulty. These differences can be used to match breeds to complement needs of production systems. Across-breed adjustment factors are needed for producers to accurately make selection decisions between sires of different breeds to improve calving difficulty. Advisor: Matthew L. Spangle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeaf area {{increase}} of individual, in vitro produced potato plantlets was analysed over three growth phases: in vitro normalisation (3 weeks, 17 or 23 °C), transplant production (2 weeks, 18 / 12 or 26 / 20 °C) and tuber production (6 weeks, 18 / 12 or 26 / 20 °C). In each phase, initial leaf area (ILA) and final leaf area (FLA) of logistically growing plants {{were related to}} parameters describing logistic growth (leaf area = A+C/(1 +exp(−Bx(t−M))); A: fitted minimum leaf area, B: fitted initial relative rate of increase, C: fitted maximum increment, M: fitted <b>midpoint,</b> MI: maximum <b>rate</b> of increase at M, MI = B×C/ 4). Higher ILA was associated with higher FLA during normalisation and transplant production, but not consistently during tuber production. During normalisation, higher ILA led to higher A, C and MI-values, and at 23 °C also to higher B and earlier M. During transplant production, higher ILA was associated with higher C. During normalisation, leaf area {{increase of}} plants with higher FLAs was characterised by higher A, C and MI-values, and at 23 °C also by earlier M. During transplant production, higher FLAs were associated with higher C and MI-values, and at 18 / 12 °C also with higher A. During tuber production, higher FLAs were associated with higher C, M and MI-values. Correlations among parameters characterising logistic growth were of physiological origin, mathematical origin, or resulted from the actual shape of the logistic curve. A and B were positively correlated, likely because clearer S-shaped curves result in higher values of both. Both parameters usually were positively correlated with MI, likely because MI {{is a function of}} B, whereas A was correlated to B. Physiologically relevant correlations were found between M and C in the tuber production phase...|$|R
