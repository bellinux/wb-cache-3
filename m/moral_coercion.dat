60|$|The {{object of}} this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as {{entitled}} to govern absolutely the dealings of society {{with the individual}} {{in the way of}} compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the <b>moral</b> <b>coercion</b> of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{coercion}} {{in mental health}} care is not self-evident and requires moral justification. A joint understanding is difficult to achieve, because patients and health professionals often evaluate coercion differently. The present study aims to discuss patients' 'moral' evaluation {{of coercion}}. We believe that such a focus can {{form the basis for}} a better and more differentiated understanding of how we evaluate coercion. This is a qualitative study based on participant observation and interviews with patients. In order to focus specifically on the <b>moral</b> evaluation of <b>coercion,</b> we looked within patients' narratives to examine whether we could differentiate between how they experienced coercion and how they morally evaluated its use, and how they envision/describe good coercion. We found that patients differentiated implicitly between experiences and moral evaluation. The findings have been ordered into three types of reactions: agreeing and accepting, fighting or resisting, and resignation. Further reflection upon patients' positive and negative <b>moral</b> evaluations of <b>coercion</b> resulted in the formulation of different concrete elements at three levels: threshold elements, process elements, and empathic elements. These elements helped us to understand what these patients considered 'good coercion'. The implications are that good clinical practice cannot be separated from the formal, <b>moral</b> evaluation of <b>coercion.</b> A differentiated <b>moral</b> understanding of <b>coercion</b> can form the basis for better and more sensitive communication about coercion among all those involved. A more respectful dialogue on the <b>moral</b> evaluation of <b>coercion</b> might also raise awareness during both the decision-making process and the actual practising of coercion...|$|R
25|$|Whigs favored {{economic}} expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats {{were opposed to}} all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote the general welfare. The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and of <b>moral</b> and economic <b>coercion,</b> held fast to the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will analyse the moral tenability of open and closed borders to immigrants. I {{will present the}} strongest reasons for open borders: freedom, <b>moral</b> equality, no <b>coercion</b> without {{democratic}} justification and improvement of life conditions. And I will present the best arguments for closed borders: the self-determination argument and the functioning society argument. I will show that the culture and freedom of association versions of the self-determination argument and the indirect cosmopolitanism version of the functioning society argument do not hold, while the democracy version of the self-determination argument and the economy and security versions of the functioning society argument do hold. I will defend that porous borders – borders that are partially open and partially closed – are the best option. Furthermore, I will give an indication on some broad guidelines and criteria that may count as a minimum standard to which states need to adapt their immigration policy. I will illustrate to what extent states already incorporate this by comparing these guidelines and criteria with the Dutch immigration policy. I will conclude with the claim that states that have a porous borders policy need to fulfil some global moral duties toward, between others, third world countries, {{in order to make}} the porous borders option morally defensible...|$|R

50|$|To {{appropriate}} and use for profit, knowledge and ideas produced by other men, without making compensation or even acknowledgment, may be inconsistent with a finer sense of propriety; but, with the exceptions indicated above misrepresentation, physical or <b>moral</b> <b>coercion,</b> or by inducing breaches of contract, {{the law has}} heretofore sanctioned the practice. Thus it was held that one may ordinarily make and sell anything in any form, may copy with exactness that which another has produced, or may otherwise use his ideas without his consent and without the payment of compensation, and yet not inflict a legal injury; and that ordinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} legal {{positivism}} “conventionalist turn” {{in relation to}} the matter of the duty to obey the law and legal normativity. In this respect, conventionalist legal positivism is worth considering a) for it offers an explanation of legal normativity partly different vis-à-vis previous ones and b) for it tries to preserve the autonomy of legal obligation from <b>moral</b> obligation and <b>coercion,</b> respectively. Here I will only focus on legal conventionalism sketched out by Hart in the Postscript. Indeed, Hart’s conventionalism faces troubles which in some way affects also other distinguished versions of legal conventionalism like, for example, those worked out by Jules Coleman, Andrei Marmor and Scott Shapiro. Other “stronger” versions of legal conventionalism like, for example, those advanced by Chaim Gans and Gerald Postema, succeed in avoiding some of the traps in which fall the previous ones but, paraphrasing Hart, the outcome is distortion as the price of internal coherence. To sum up, legal conventionalism follows two pathways, both of them in the end unsatisfactory. The first pathway – opened by Hart – leads to a “weak” version of conventionalism. This approach fails in so far as it does not succeed in preserving the autonomy of legal obligation from moral one. The second pathway – followed in different ways by Gans and Postema – does not soften conventionalism and so it achieves the outcome to design a coherent conventionalist model of legal normativity but at the price of distorting reality...|$|R
40|$|Sanctions are coercive {{measures}} taken against a state which has committed an international illegal act or has seriously breached an international rule or obligation, {{by a state}} {{or a group of}} states or decided by an international organization. The sanctions and countermeasures are a form of coercion for the guilty state. Constraint is traditionally {{regarded as one of the}} leading problems in the international law. With reference to the lack of a centralized apparatus of coercion, many thinkers denied the legal nature of the liability law, giving it the character of a positive <b>moral.</b> In fact, <b>coercion</b> plays an important role in the functioning of international law and is one of the characteristic features of the operating mechanism. Constraint as part of the method of operation of the international law is not a violation, but a means of achieving the right. The basic element of coercion is legality, including in terms of foundation, method and volume. Constraint is primarily determined by the goals and principles of international law. Countermeasures are limited by the temporary failure on the part of the injured state towards the guilty state and they are considered legal until they have reached their purpose. They should be applied in such a way to allow restoration of the application of the violated obligations. This rule relates to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the law of treaties, according to which "during the period of suspension, the parties shall refrain from any acts which would tend to prevent the resumption of the treaty"[1]...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} thought that {{wrongful}} acts of threat-involving coercion are wrong because they involve {{a violation of}} the freedom or autonomy of the targets of those acts. I argue here that this cannot possibly be right, and that in fact the wrongness of wrongful coercion has nothing at all to do with the effect such actions have on their targets. This negative thesis is supported by pointing out that what we say about the ethics of threatening (and thus the ethics of coercion) constrains what we can say about the ethics of warning and offering. Importantly, our favoured explanation of the wrongness of certain kinds of threatening should not commit us to condemning as wrong parallel cases of warning and offering. My positive project is to show how this can be done. I defend the claim that wrongful coercion is nothing more than the issuing of a conditional threat to do wrong, and that an agent's issuing of a conditional threat to do wrong is wrong because it constitutes motivation for that agent to adopt the announced intention to do wrong. The idea of explaining the wrongness of wrongful coercion in this way has gone unnoticed because we have thus far been mistaken about what a threat is. In this essay I present my <b>moral</b> analysis of <b>coercion</b> only after presenting a careful descriptive analysis of threats. On my view, it is essential to a threat that the announced intention is one that the agent does not possess before announcing it. This analysis makes it possible to elucidate the descriptive differences between threats, warnings and offers, which sets up the later project of elucidating the moral differences between them.

Brazil also had the largest number of members of the Nazi Party outside of Germany, with 2,822 members. The large number of people with German roots and a notable number of Nazi members were used by the Brazilian government to justify their programs of nationalization. During World War II, in 1942, Nazi Germany attacked Brazilian ships and Brazil declared war against Germany. President Getúlio Vargas initiated a strict program of forced cultural assimilation - Nacionalismo- that worked quite efficiently, if not initially.He forbade any organised manifestation of German culture in Brazil. Schools were required to teach exclusively in Portuguese, and the publishing of books, newspapers and magazines in foreign languages (which in practice meant German language and Italian language) was subjected to prior censorship by the Ministry of Justice The use of foreign languages in governmental precincts was forbidden, as well as the use of foreign languages in religious services.

40|$|Youthworx is an Australian {{initiative}} that enables {{at risk and}} marginalised young people to participate in community radio and multimedia co-creation. It involves a social partnership between Youth Development Australia (a not for profit agency), the Salvation Army, SYN-Media (a youth-run community radio station), and university researchers. An innovative social partnership is {{making it possible for}} troubled and homeless young people, failed by the school system, to create live radio, short films, music, blogs and other multimedia creations. It also brings them into a very different and challenging environment: the co-operative ethos of the youth-run radio station SYN-Media. This paper describes some of what is happening as the Youthworx recruits interact with the committed young pro-am media producers at SYN. The young people coming into Youthworx through the Salvation Army are not socially-confident media adepts. They can make compelling media, though, and they can connect with peers and find new skills and a different voice. Question is, are voice, communication and creativity enough to transform lives? Youthworx media trainers are skilled at offering ‘supervised freedom’ without <b>moral</b> <b>coercion,</b> using charismatic pedagogic techniques to guide without instructing. Creativity may be the way for troubled young people to remake themselves. But is this ‘voice’ or ventriloquism? Opportunity or episode? These young people have multiple needs and complex personal histories. It may turn out that the learning experience is too short-lived, for some, to offer a real alternative to addiction, depression or dependence. At this point, we don’t know, but we have begun to do ethnographic research into what is happening, on site, as ‘at risk youth’ make media content for their peers. Our aim is to describe the mix of creative, technical, social, vocational and ethical skills they are gaining, without falling too easily into the assumption that creativity is the cure for social, emotional and economic ills. In this paper, we summarise our early findings and draw out the dilemmas for research in tracking the effectiveness, over time, of a youth media initiative of this sort...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} offers a {{morphological}} study ot coercion {{as a means}} ot social control organized within political society. We are dealing here with a highly descriptive study, a tact which does not prevent the author from incidentally making scientitic appraisals or trom delíberately offering the bases tor appreciations ot an ethical and social nature. After a series ot introductory considerations destined to put torth the presence and objectives ot coercion and ot violence within the ample panorama ot social realíty -and particularly within the framework ot political experiences- the author proposes a precise concept ot coercion {{which serves as a}} gUide tor a more complete and more satistactory typological analysis ot the same. The first step in this analysis consists ot the differentiation between the two main types ot material coercion -physical and moral- and that type ot coercion which the author calls virtuai, which tinds its most commonly known and treated manitestation in mandates and imperative acts. It is important to point out the observations dedicated to the concepts ot admonition and ot degradation as the principal forms ot <b>moral</b> <b>coercion,</b> as well as those which are brought to bear upon the idea ot political Constitution in its relations with the phenomena of material and virtual coercion. In the concepts of political «retention» and «subjection», we find a plausible base of discussion for making up a realístic image of the Constitution of the State, as it is considered in one of its facets. The author then dedicates a large part ot his study to examining the diverse modalíties of coercion, keeping in mind the different functions which it can accomplish. He then explains, along with the thoroughly studied torms of reparatory and dissuasive coercion, the ideas of basic polítical coercion -to be found in practice in deportation measures, for example-, ot eliminatory coercion -which touches, very characteristically, acts pertaining to the políce- and of testimonial coercion. The study of this last type leads to the establishment ot various interesting conclusions with regard to judicial proceedings of a polítical nature, and the exercise of the prerogative ot penal grace by means of amnesty or indult. Finally, the explanation of the contrast between ponderable coercion and expeditious coercion contributes to the desirable finality ot correctly determining the límits ot Law within the framework ot coercion as a means of social control within the State...|$|E

Tomando-se como princípio de que a liberdade, em Kant, se reveste de autonomia, fazem com que todos possam agir conforme os seus interesses, contudo sem jamais poder ignorar o conhecimento do imperativo da moralidade, sem poder ignorar a existência de sua realidade supra-sensível. Partindo de uma pesquisa bibliográfica nas obras kantianas sobre filosofia política, buscar-se-á mostrar como, ao tratar de direito penal, Kant fundamenta o rigor da sua proposta punitiva na existência da lei moral no interior de todos os seres humanos. Neste estudo, partindo do conceito de que, em Kant, o direito nos remete a coação exterior que sofremos para poder agirmos socialmente de acordo com a lei e, a existência da moralidade, também exerce sobre nós outra forma de coação: a coação moral, que é uma coação interior e que na punição, antes da existência de uma sentença condenatória, o criminoso pune a si mesmo, como uma forma de recuperar a sua dignidade perdida no cometimento da prática delituosa, reajustando o criminoso com o seu foro íntimo. To if {{dealing with}} the criminal legal philosophy in Kant, objective in this work of research, arguing the moral bedding of the penalty, {{from the perspective of}} the existence of a duality of citizens in the soul of all the human beings. Being overcome as principle with that the freedom, in Kant, if coats with autonomy, they make with that all can act as its interests, however without never being able to ignore the knowledge of the imperative of the morality, without being able to ignore the existence of its supply-sensible reality. Breaking of a bibliographical research in the Kantians workmanships on philosophy politics, one will search to show as, when dealing with criminal law, Kant it bases the severity of its proposal punitive on the existence of the moral law in the interior of all the human beings.

40|$|The {{progress}} {{of medicine and}} of its auxiliary sciences in {{the last fifty years}} has led to an increase in man's average life expectancy and to the aging of the world's population. This same development also entails the danger of manipulation of the human body and of its functions, especially at the very onset of life (generation control), and at its very end (euthanasia). It is to be fea red al so that with the {{progress of}} medicine man may beco me used to thinking that death is no longer an inexorable biological fact, but rather the result of a freely-taken decision (positive or negative euthanasia), so that as a consequence of this new line of thinking euthanasia may become legalised in those countries where the concept of the dignity of human life has been lost. At this stage of the manipulation of man -so characteristic of the modern world- it must be remembered that Natural Law and Morality prohibit euthanasia; they do not, on the other hand, make the use of extraordinary means to keep a person alive obligatory. The criterion which doctors have followed until now in the fight for life can and shoul be applied in the case of young patients, especially those who have suffered accidents or trauma while being in the prime of health. But it do es not seem to be mandatory to use extraordinary means in the case of elderly, chronicalIy ill, or incurable patients. In these cases, common sense and the correct application of moral norms indicate that life should not be prolonged artificially, because this is tantamount to prolonging the agony of the dying or the sufferings of those patients who have entered into the final phases of their illnesses. It is therefore convenient to distinguish between three concepts to this effect. 1). Positive euthanasia means the direct causing of the patient's death. 2). Negative euthanasia can be defined as the refraining from use of effective mean s to cure a patient. 3). We are dealing here with a new concept -the artificial prolongation of life- based on the utilization of mean s which are ineffective as far as curing the patient is concerned, but effective in that they will serve to prolong the patient's life a few days or a few weeks. In this last instance, the decisión corresponds to the patient himself. In the event of the patient's being either unconscious or too weak to be able to decide, then the decision rests upon his direct next-of·kin. The doctor has the right solely to operate within the limits prescribed by the patient, and must not employ any <b>moral</b> <b>coercion</b> with the purpose of having extraordinary means applied...|$|E
