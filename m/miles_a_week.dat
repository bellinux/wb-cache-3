25|$|Rutherford became {{general manager}} and the {{business}} steadily expanded. He was an excellent manager, a fine judge of horses and men, and maintained good relations between the management and the employees. In June 1862 Rutherford moved ten coaches from the Castlemaine, Victoria Depot in Victoria to Bathurst, New South Wales and re-established the company's headquarters there. Extensions into Queensland were made in 1865, {{and the growth of}} the business was so great that by 1870 6,000 horses were harnessed each day and the coaches were travelling 28,000 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Rutherford, who lived at Bathurst from 1862, began acquiring station properties, which he managed himself with the most up-to-date means, and in 1873, with John Sutherland, he founded the Lithgow iron works. This started with a capital of £100,000 all of which had been lost when Rutherford took over its management. Rutherford succeeded in making the ironworks pay its way, but there was little profit in it and the business was eventually sold.|$|E

50|$|On August 16, 2014, NBCSN {{journalist}} Robin Miller {{reported that}} Ed Carpenter would merge his team with Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing, {{whom he had}} raced for in 2011; the two teams officially announced the merger at the Milwaukee <b>Mile</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later. The next day, SFHR driver Josef Newgarden was resigned to a one-year extension to race with CFH. On August 27, the team announced they would run with Chevrolet engines, and a month later, Carpenter confirmed Fuzzy's Award Winning Vodka would follow the team to sponsor the 20. The team made its debut with Carpenter driving in testing for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company at Indianapolis Motor Speedway from September 23-24, followed by a session at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course with Newgarden and Mike Conway.|$|R

60|$|A new race of {{intimate}} friends has sprung up at Veneering's since {{he went into}} Parliament for the public good, to whom Mrs Veneering is very attentive. These friends, like astronomical distances, are only to be spoken of in the very largest figures. Boots says {{that one of them}} is a Contractor who (it has been calculated) gives employment, directly and indirectly, to five hundred thousand men. Brewer says that another of them is a Chairman, in such request at so many Boards, so far apart, that he never travels less by railway than three thousand <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Buffer says that another of them hadn't a sixpence eighteen months ago, and, through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty-five, and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash, has now three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds--Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy-five, and declining to take a farthing less. With Buffer, Boots, and Brewer, Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip-Church: surveying them through her eyeglass, and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them? with other pleasantries of that nature. Veneering, in his different way, is much occupied with the Fathers too, piously retiring with them into the conservatory, from which retreat the word 'Committee' is occasionally heard, and where the Fathers instruct Veneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left, take the level of the mantelpiece, cross by an open cutting at the candelabra, seize the carrying-traffic at the console, and cut up the opposition root and branch at the window curtains.|$|E

25|$|On January 17, the {{campaign}} to conquer Málaga began when the newly constituted Army of the South under Queipo de Llano advanced from the west and soldiers led by Colonel Antonio Muñoz Jiménez attacked from the northeast. Both attacks encountered little resistance and made advances of up to 15 <b>miles</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The Republicans failed {{to realize that the}} Nationalists were concentrating for an attack on Málaga and thus they remained unreinforced and unprepared for the main attack on February 3.|$|R

5000|$|The 5000 metres is {{a premier}} event that {{requires}} tactics and superior aerobic conditioning.

25|$|On 11 May 1935, the {{prototype}} (U-8, later G-ADFE), built by Philips and Powis (Miles Aircraft), first flew at Woodley Aerodrome, piloted by F.G. <b>Miles.</b> <b>A</b> few <b>weeks</b> later, the Merlin {{was delivered to}} Birkett Air Service, for its air taxi and charter business based at Heston Aerodrome. Two aircraft were built, and delivered to Tata Sons Ltd for its Tata Air Lines service on the Karachi-Madras route. The fourth and final Merlin was delivered to E.

50|$|He {{made his}} CART debut in 1983, racing for the Kraco Enterprises team. Andretti re-signed for Kraco to {{undertake}} the 1984 season, where he managed five third-place finishes and ended his rookie season in seventh overall. In the Indianapolis 500, he finished fifth and shared the Rookie of the Year award with Roberto Guerrero. He {{went on to win}} his first IndyCar race in 1986 in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. The season became a two-man battle for the championship title, between Michael and Bobby Rahal. Andretti would take the points lead with his victory on the Milwaukee <b>Mile.</b> <b>A</b> <b>week</b> later, on Father's Day, Michael was leading on the final lap at Portland, when his March-Cosworth 86C ran out of fuel, allowing his father, Mario, to beat him by just 0.07 seconds. It {{was one of the most}} shocking finishes in the history of IndyCar, and the closest finish (until 1997). With Rahal continuing to win races, Andretti's consistent finishing only allowed Rahal a nine-point lead in the standing with two races remaining. Andretti won a key victory in at Phoenix. Going into the season finale at Tamiami Park, Andretti was just three point behind Rahal, but neither driver were a factor in the race, with Andretti retiring with a broken halfshalf.|$|R

50|$|Fred Pilon, the {{publisher}} of UltraRunning Magazine, estimates that there are 8,000 Americans who run ultra marathons, which is defined as anything above the standard 26.2-mile marathon. That group includes Joe Schlereth of Fresno, Calif., who ran 9,021 miles in 1996 (173.5 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>week),</b> and the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team of Jamaica, Queens, which began a 3,100-mile race, around a city block, on June 13 with a 51-day time limit. Most ultrarunners, Pilon said, are hobbyists who average 50-60 miles per week.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{experience}} at the park was a blend of rugged outdoor living complemented with the trappings of the modern middle-class lifestyle.

50|$|Burns {{switched}} from arable farming to dairying {{and then decided}} {{to give up the}} farm altogether as his career in the Excise looked more remunerative. For two years Burns worked as both a farmer and an exciseman, having received his excise commission on 14 July 1788. He had to ride two hundred <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to carry out his excise duties and had also to labour in the fields.

60|$|But {{camouflage}} or no camouflage, {{the bulk}} of both the French and British forces in the new won ground of the great offensive lay necessarily in the open. Only the big guns and the advanced Red Cross stations had got into pits and subterranean hiding places. The advance has been too rapid and continuous for the armies to {{make much of a}} toilette as they halted, and the destruction and the desolation of the country won afforded few facilities for easy concealment. Tents, transport, munitions, these all indicated an army on the march--at the rate of half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> or so, to Germany. If the wet and mud of November and December have for a time delayed that advance, the force behind has but accumulated for the resumption of the thrust.|$|R
