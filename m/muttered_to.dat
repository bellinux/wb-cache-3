500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and <b>muttered</b> <b>to</b> one of his clerks, [...] "What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{overcome}} {{food poisoning}} {{leading up to}} the match, Barnes was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first, and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris {{at the top of the}} order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Bill Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and was reported to have casually <b>muttered</b> <b>to</b> umpire Frank Chester [...] "Eh, the light!", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946–47, Barnes continuously appealed against the light, forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball attack of Edrich and Alec Bedser to reach stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. However, Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon.|$|E
500|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly <b>muttered</b> <b>to</b> umpire Frank Chester in a casual tone [...] "Eh, the light!", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it {{would be up to}} the umpires to offer an adjournment. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They reached stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions. At this stage, following their tail-end resistance, England were in a good position with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket, forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to authorizing torture, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% {{of these are}} confirmed to have been shot. While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly <b>muttered</b> <b>to</b> no one in particular: [...] "Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one." [...] Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: [...] "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruce tells Kröd {{that the}} word Engamora, which Arcadius <b>muttered</b> <b>to</b> Kröd before he died, refers to a prophecy that chronicles the {{overthrow}} of an empire at the [...] "The Golden One", which Bruce said is [...] "a slightly less clichéd way of saying the Chosen One". Bruce says Arcadius believes the prophecy spoke of Kröd, but Kröd does not believe it. They are interrupted when Dongalor and his men ride into the village and demand Kröd’s surrender. Kröd jumps forward to attacks Dongalor, but he overshoots him and leaps right into his carriage, and explains that he forgot the blade sticks {{in some of the}} warmer months. Before he can pull his sword out, one of Dongalor's guards hits him over the head, rendering himself unconscious. Dongalor ties Kröd {{to the back of his}} carriage and rides off, but Kröd escapes by swinging back and forth until the rope snaps and he is freed.|$|E
