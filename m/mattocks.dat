Donaldson started against Haiti, and scored the only goal of the match after 62 minutes with a header from a corner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mattocks</b> {{made from}} antlers first {{appear in the}} British Isles in the Late Mesolithic.

25|$|After initial {{plans to}} use drummers from The Weather Prophets and Thee Hypnotics for the {{recording}} of Playing With Fire, a permanent drummer was recruited in late August: Jonny <b>Mattock.</b> Despite this he does not appear on Playing With Fire – a drum machine was used {{on all of the}} songs and no drummer is credited on the album. <b>Mattock</b> had been playing in a Northampton band called 'The Apple Creation'.

25|$|Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, {{and farmers}} were carried by nearly all.

25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and <b>mattocks</b> were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or <b>mattocks</b> must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed earth between the furrows, the fields are often cross-ploughed lengthwise and widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of <b>mattocks</b> are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and {{parallel}} with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a mattock fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or firm ground. The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands. The mattock is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to slide down and be removed.|$|E

The <b>mattock</b> is described as gloriously beautiful; it is made of pure gold and has a head carved from lapis lazuli.
