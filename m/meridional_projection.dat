40|$|The 3 D {{structure}} of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are examined {{on the basis}} of numerical solutions of the MHD equations. The numerical solution in a meridional plane centered over the region of newly emerged flux has features similar to those computed in previous 2 D simulations. The CME is found to be shaped more like an arcade with an axis parallel to the Equator than like a bubble. This characteristic arcade shape occurs both in the density distribution in meridional and azimuthal planes and in the integrated white-light brightness in meridional and polar views. Examination of the brightness change due to the CME shows that the CME in a <b>meridional</b> <b>projection</b> as viewed from the earth has the same loop shape even if the CME originates almost directly in front of or behind the sun...|$|E
40|$|The {{solution}} of the blade-to-blade (quasi- 3 -dimensional) steady, inviscid flow in turbomachines is considered as a quantitative prediction of the flow and as a good approximation of the real three-dimensional flow. The well known governing differential equation is of elliptic type and its numerical solution is a rather difficult problem (taking also into account the complex form of the S 1 stream surface). By the procedure proposed, the S 1 stream surface in the (m, θ) coordinate system {{is transformed into a}} rectangular (x,, y, space, by the application of the following transformation:x=m/L, (θ-θ 1) /(θ 2 -θ 1), whereθ 1 and θ 2 are the angular positions of the lines limiting the S 1 surface, and L the length of the <b>meridional</b> <b>projection</b> of the blade. By the introduction of this transformation, extra terms are added to the differential equation, but now the definition of the grid is easier. From the transformed differential equation, a system of algebraic equations is obtained applying the finite volume method. The system of algebraic equations is solved by a relaxation method with periodic boundary conditions. The grid applied in the (x, y) coordinate system is not of uniform density in order to define better the geometry of the blades near the leading and trailing edges. Finally the results from the application of the procedure on a centrifugal, mixed flow pump are presented; i. e. relative velocity and static pressure distribution along the blade surfaces. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Previously unaddressed {{aspects of}} how {{equatorial}} currents affect long Rossby wave phase speeds are investigated using solutions of the shallow-water equations linearized about quasi-realistic currents. Modification {{of the background}} potential vorticity (PV) gradient by curvature in the narrow equatorial currents is shown {{to play a role}} comparable to the Doppler shift emphasized by previous authors. The important variables are the <b>meridional</b> <b>projections</b> of mean-current features onto relevant aspects of the wave field. As previously shown, Doppler shifting of long Rossby waves is determined by the projection of the mean currents onto the wave’s squared zonal-velocity and pressure fields. PV-gradient modification matters {{only to the extent that}} it projects onto the wave field’s squared meridional velocity. Because the zeros of an equatorial wave’s meridional velocity are staggered relative to those of the zonal velocity and pressure, and because the meridional scales of the equatorial currents are similar to those of the low-mode Rossby waves, different parts of the current system dominate the advective and PV-gradient modification effects on a single mode. Since the equatorial symmetry of classical equatorial waves alternates between symmetric and antisymmetric with increasing meridional mode number, the currents produce opposite effects on adjacent modes. Meridional mode 1 is slowed primarily by a combination of eastward advection by the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the PV-gradient decrease at the peaks of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). The mode- 2 phase speed, in contrast, is increased primarily by a combination of westward advection by the SEC and the PV-gradient increase at the core of the EUC. Perturbation solutions are carried to second order in ϵ, the Rossby number of the mean current, and it is shown that this is necessary to capture the full effect of quasi-realistic current systems, which are asymmetric about the equator. Equatorially symmetric components of the current system affect the phase speed at O(ϵ), but antisymmetric components of the currents and distortions of the wave structures by the currents do not influence the phase speed until O(ϵ²) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} static {{pressures on the}} stator vane suction side of a high-speed single stage fan using the technique of pressure sensitive paint (PSP). The paper illustrates development in application of the relatively new experimental technique to the complex environment of internal flows in turbomachines. First, there is a short explanation of the physics of the PSP technique and a discussion of calibration methods for pressure sensitive paint in the turbomachinery environment. A description of the image conversion process follows. The recorded image of the stator vane pressure field is skewed due to the limited optical access and must be converted to the <b>meridional</b> plane <b>projection</b> for comparison with analytical predictions. The experimental results for seven operating conditions along an off-design rotational speed line are shown in a concise form, including performance map points, mindspan static tap pressure distributions, and vane suction side pressure fields. Then, a comparison between static tap and pressure sensitive paint data is discussed. Finally, the paper lists shortcomings of the pressure sensitive paint technology and lessons learned in this high-speed fan application...|$|R
40|$|NCAR thermospheric-general-circulation-model (TGCM) {{computations}} of solar-maximum thermospheric neutral-gas {{temperature and}} circulation around the December solstice are presented and discussed. The TGCM uses a 5 x 5 -deg grid and 24 constant-pressure layers, corresponding to altitudes of about 97 - 500 km. The results are mapped as electron-density contours, polar plots, cylindrical equidistant <b>projections,</b> <b>meridional</b> cross sections, and F-region polar plots comparing the TGCM predictions with DE- 2 satellite observations. The {{significant differences between}} summer and winter high-latitude F-region winds are attributed to the ion drag momentum associated with magnetospheric convection. The TGCM wind predictions follow the same pattern as the satellite measurements but are too small; possible model corrections are considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} undertaken of Pc 3 - 4 waves recorded {{on the ground with}} the IMAGE magnetometer array (56 degrees 0. 6) across the entire station array. Most of these had well-defined wave packet appearance in time series records and a clear peak in power spectra. Their occurrence and frequency suggest the waves are generated by the upstream ion-cyclotron resonance mechanism, with no evidence of generation by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For each event the amplitude, phase, coherence, ellipticity, azimuth angle, and degree of polarization across the ground array were examined. The coherence length, azimuthal wave number, and hence the apparent wave propagation velocity were thus determined, with emphasis on the precision and significance of these measurements. It was found that these daytime Pc 3 - 4 pulsations usually have maximum amplitude near the magnetopause <b>projection,</b> <b>meridional</b> coherence lengths of order 1. 5 - 2. 0 x 10 (3) km, and low azimuthal wave numbers during morning hours, averaging around - 4. 0 (indicating westward propagation). Over 80 % of events propagated poleward and westward, with average equivalent ground velocity of 41 km/s N 43 degrees W for the H component. About 24 - 30 % of the events are higher harmonics of field line resonances. There {{is no evidence that the}} remaining events arise from cavity modes or localized modulated electron precipitation. The observations instead suggest a mechanism involving mode coupling and field-guided propagation. In this model, fast mode waves in the Pc 3 - 4 range entering near the subsolar point propagate earthward and due to the inhomogeneity of the magnetosphere couple to the field-guided Alfven mode. At certain latitudes, standing oscillations are established at harmonics of the local resonant frequency, while at other latitudes traveling waves convey energy to low altitudes. The expected L dependence of wave power and travel time agree well with observed amplitude and phase profiles...|$|R
