40|$|The first METEOSAT Second Generation {{satellite}} {{will come}} into service in 2001. It will acquire image data in 12 spectral channels with a total data volume of 265 Mbytes every 15 minutes. These data are received, processed, and distributed by the EUMETSAT Ground Segment in real-time. The Ground Segment architecture is composed of blocks of grouped functionality called facilities. The Image Processing Facility (IMPF) provides the functionality for radiometric and geometrical corrections of the SEVIRI raw data from the MSG satellite. It receives three independent data streams from the Primary Ground Station (PGS) : SEVIRI raw data (Level 1. 0), telemetry data, and GERB raw data. This paper describes {{the architecture of the}} Image Processing Facility and presents an overview of the main processing steps necessary to transform Level 1. 0 into Level 1. 5 data. The latter is a rectified multi-channel MSG image in the standard geo-stationary projection, which is then distributed to other facilities: the Unified Meteorological Archiving and Retrieval Facility (UMARF) for archiving, the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility (MPEF) as the basis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>product</b> generation, and the Data Acquisition and Dissemination Facility (DADF) for distribution to world wider users.

The cloud-processing is split into two separate tasks - the cloud detection (called scenes analysis (SCE)) and the cloud analysis (CLA). The scenes analysis derives a cloud mask (cloud/no cloud decision), while the cloud analysis derives detailed information on the cloud type. Both, the cloud mask and the cloud analysis are derived on a pixel basis. The MSG scenes and cloud analysis scheme has also been adopted by the processing scheme for the current Meteosat satellites. This scheme has become operational in June 2003 and improved the cloud detection and classification with the Meteosat- 7 satellite...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of meteorological products from satellite imagery data {{is a key}} element of the EUMETSAT satellite programs.

After successful commissioning the operational products derived with current Meteosat imagery data will be enhanced with new products derived with the MSG <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility (MSG MPEF). The improved capability of the MSG image data as compared to Meteosat enables more accurate cloud detection and classification. The higher sampling in time and space provides further improvements that will directly increase the quality of several of the existing key products like Clear Sky Radiance (CSR) and Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) products. The multitude of channels will enable the estimation of cloud top heights with higher accuracy than before as well as the derivation of completely new products like Total Ozone (TOZ) and Global Instability Index (GII) ...|$|E
40|$|Precipitation is the {{meteorological}} parameter affecting {{people in the}} most direct way. Forecasting the spatial and temporal distribution of rain and snow is therefore {{one of the major}} challenges for the meteorological services. Satellite remote sensing of precipitation could help to improve these forecasts. The most direct method to retrieve precipitation from spaceborne measurements is based on data from passive or active microwave sensors. These sensors are only available on low orbiting satellites up to now. In addition the spatial resolution of microwave sensors is hardly sufficient to resolve small scale precipitation events. Infrared brightness temperatures from geostationary satellites are only related indirectly to the precipitation at the ground but have a high spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore methods to combine both retrieval systems have been developed. EUMETSAT implemented such a `blending' technique in the re-processing branch of its <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility (MPEF). Rain rates derived from measurements of the Special Sensor Microwave / Imager (SSM/I) onboard of the US-DMSP satellites are combined with brightness temperatures from the Infrared channel of the MTP-METEOSAT satellites...|$|E

Unlike standard CERES products, FLASHFlux does not maintain a long-term consistent record. Therefore the latest algorithm changes and input data can be incorporated into processing.

40|$|In August 2002 as {{the first}} Meteosat Second Generation {{satellite}} was launched a new era started at EUMETSAT. The satellite was successfully commissioned {{by the end of}} 2003 and started routine operations in January 2004 as Meteosat- 8. The imager on this new satellite enables the continuation of the derivation of products that are key elements of the global observing system like Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) and Clear Sky Radiances. The new imager presents several improvements over the imager on the first generation satellites, e. g. higher temporal and spatial sampling and more spectral bands. The improvements enable several significant enhancements and improvements for the operational products already produced with data from the first generation satellites. Significant improvements are expected in cloud classification, which inevitably will improve all products. Additionally it is expected that the AMVs are improved for instance in data frequency, coverage, tracking, height assignment and quality control. Finally new products like Total Ozone and the Global Instability Index are also derived in near-real time. This paper will present the products currently derived by the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility with Meteosat- 8 data at EUMETSAT.

40|$|The SEVIRI ground {{characterisation}} data {{describes the}} fundamental {{characteristics of the}} SEVIRI instrument. The ground characterisation data is based on measurements made with the SEVIRI instrument during pre-launch testing. Among other things, it describes {{the response of the}} instrument (in counts) {{as a function of the}} incoming spectral blackbody radiance for the infrared channels 4 - 11. This includes both the effect of the non-linear response to the absorbed radiant energy as well as the non-linear effect of a finite spectral bandwidth. The SEVIRI ground characterisation data is a fundamental input to the MSG Image Processing Facility, which consequently also generates Level 1. 5 images defined in terms of spectral blackbody radiance (i. e. at a defined wavenumber). In contrast, the MSG <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility, works in terms of effective blackbody radiance (i. e. representing the integral over the spectral band), as commonly done for the derivation of meteorological products. EUMETSAT has concluded that, from the user perspective, the best way to resolve the inconsistency is to modify the MSG Image Processing Facility to generate Level 1. 5 Image Products in terms of effective blackbody radiance rather than spectral blackbody radiance, an important argument for this being that it will bring the EUMETSAT approach in line with the calibration scheme in use by other satellite operators. This modification requires both the re-generation of SEVIRI ground characterisation data in terms of effective radiance and the modification of the MSG Image Processing Facility to support the new radiance definition. This paper describes the differences between the old and the new product definition...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that reliable, long-term and well distributed climate information is essential to inform any development policy that aims to address the consequences of climate variability and change on water resources. However, in developing countries planning of such activity is greatly hampered {{by the lack of}} a sufficiently dense network of weather stations measuring precipitation. The objective of this dissertation is, therefore, to evaluate the freely available high resolution satellite rainfall estimates in the Lake Tana Basin which has a relatively denser ground rainfall stations network. Rainfall estimates of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 42 version 7, EUMETSAT's <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Product</b> Extraction Facility (MPEF), Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate-Geostationary (MPEG) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) are considered. The satellite rainfall is validated by a direct comparison with the gauged rainfall data, and through hydrological modelling to capture the observed flow using a semi-distributed hydrological model Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) and Parameter Efficient Distributed (PED). The result of direct comparison indicated that, the MPEG and CFSR rainfall provided the most accurate rainfall estimates. On average, for 38 stations, 78 and 86 % of the observed rainfall variation is explained by MPEG and CFSR data, respectively, while TRMM explained only 17 % of the variation. The hydrological modelling indicated that both the gauged and the CFSR precipitation estimates were able to reproduce the stream flow well for either of the models. The TRMM data was not be able to capture the observed flow through model calibration for both models. Bias corrected MPEG rainfall by the gauged monthly means performed as well as or better than the gauged rainfall data in capturing the observed flow through hydrologic model calibration. This dissertation has also identified potential irrigable areas by considering hydrological and landscape factors that determine lack of irrigation development in the Ethiopian highland. Potential land areas suitable for surface irrigation were determined by using a GIS based MultiCriteria Evaluation (MCE) technique by considering climate characteristics (rainfall and evaporation), land features (soil type, land use and slope), market access (town and road proximity) and proximity to a perennial river. The available water for surface irrigation was quantified by analysing historical river flow data during the dry season of the major rivers in the Lake Tana Basin. The result indicated that the main limitation for surface irrigation in the Ethiopian highlands is the availability of water and not land suitable for irrigation. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|The modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models used {{to predict}} the weather {{conditions}} work on large scales in both time and space. On the other hand, meteorological events, like thunderstorms, often develop on smallest timeframe because they last from few minutes to few hours, and on a spatial scale that ranges from hundred meters to some kilometers. For these reasons, {{it is clear that}} the NWP models are insufficient in order to achieve a good prediction of the extreme meteorological events and it is necessary to use other kind of models, which are able to give high resolution (in space and in time) predictions with a given degree of confidence. The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, thanks to its high spatial resolution its capacity to provide new images after few minutes, gives the possibility to satisfy some of the requirements needed by nowcasting applications. Indeed MSG allows to follow the development of extreme meteorological events and, in a more wide view, gives the possibility to monitor the environment in an efficient way and to plan actions in the case of dangerous events. This work discusses the integration of a new nowcasting model, named MeteoCAST (Meteorological Combined Algorithm for Storm Tracking) with the Nowcasting Satellite Application Facility (NWCSAF) framework. The MeteoCAST model produces forecasted synthetic MSG infrared channels, which represent the 2 -hours ahead projection, using an ensemble of neural models (DAN approach [25]). The NWCSAF suite is a framework developed under the responsibility of the AEMET. It is based on the MSG and Polar images and is able to produce several <b>meteorological</b> <b>products</b> using the observed images.

This deceivingly simple structure offers very interesting challenges for wind and wave modeling, not easily, if ever, found elsewhere. Using standard <b>meteorological</b> <b>products</b> and local wind and wave models, this study explores how well the general and unusual wind and wave patterns of the Red Sea could be reproduced.

The unusual wind and wave patterns in the Red Sea suggest that the currently available wave model source functions may not properly represent the evolution of local fields.

EqL-coordinate comparisons of MLS version 2. 2 and SO data show good quantitative agreement throughout the stratosphere for most of these species, with significant biases for a few species in localized regions. Comparisons in EqL coordinates of MLS and SO data, and of SO data with geographically coincident MLS data provide insight into where and how sampling effects are important in interpretation of the sparse SO data, thus assisting in fully utilizing the SO data in scientific studies and comparisons with other sparse datasets. The DMPs are valuable for scientific studies and to facilitate validation of non-coincident measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this modern}} age where {{technology}} can generate high-resolution meteorological models and user-friendly graphics at real-time speeds, the understanding becomes lost that these products in themselves are simply meteorological tools {{and do not}} constitute a comprehensive weather forecast. Like a hammer still requires a carpenter to build a house, current day meteorological models still require a meteorologist to interpret all the pertinent models and assimilate other <b>meteorological</b> <b>products</b> to produce a more accurate and complete forecast. Only when a forecast has reached its most accurate potential, should it be delivered in multidimensional color graphics and Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs). Meteorological decision aids traditionally fall into two categories within the Federal Aviation Administration, (1) model-derived probabilistic products that describe {{the chances of a}} weather phenomena, and (2) deterministic products that forecast a “go/no go ” of a specific airport runway or air route program. Deterministic product development often requires knowledge of not only the meteorological situation, but aircraft limits and the limits and capability of the specific airport or route for which the forecast tactical decision aid is developed. This study shows through qualitative means that although model-derived probabilistic products seem to be helpful in traffic management decisions, accurate deterministic products and consultations by meteorologists result in a large reduction in aircraft holding and diversions which increase safety and reduce airline costs. 1...|$|R
