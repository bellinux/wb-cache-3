40|$|Phase {{transitions}} between semiconducting 2 H and metallic 1 T (or 1 T′) <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulphides</b> (MoS 2) are explored comprehensively by first-principles calculations. The nucleation of a 1 T (or 1 T′) nucleus in a 2 H MoS 2 lattice, {{the formation}} of the 2 H- 1 T (1 T′) interfaces and the kinetics of interface propagation during phase transition were thoroughly investigated in this study. It was found that, among various potential interface structures between the two phases, Mo-rich and two S-rich zigzag (ZZ) boundaries are energetically more preferable than others. Therefore, triangular or hexagonal 1 T MoS 2 domains with the three types of ZZ boundaries are expected to be the equilibrium structures of the 1 T nucleus in a 2 H lattice. Further exploration reveals a very high nucleation energy of the 1 T phase which suggests that the nucleation may start from a defect site or the edge of the 2 H phase. Besides, the kinetics of 2 H- 1 T (1 T′) boundary propagation show that the growth rate of the ZZ boundaries is significantly slower than the armchair (AC) ones'. Therefore, the ZZ-boundary dominated domains are expected to be observed during the growth of the 1 T phase while the rounded domains with various high-index edges are expected to be seen throughout shrinkage.

These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, Japan wax, bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulphide,</b> mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, cup grease, lithium soap, water pump grease, and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|E

The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil control ring to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil control ring. It used low friction rings and a <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulphide</b> coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower.

50|$|Shot peening and {{abrasive}} blasting can apply materials on metal surfaces. When the shot or grit particles are blasted through a powder or liquid containing the desired surface coating, the impact plates or coats the workpiece surface. The {{process has been}} used to embed ceramic coatings, though the coverage is random rather than coherent. 3M developed a process where a metal surface was blasted with particles with a core of alumina and an outer layer of silica. The result was fusion of the silica to the surface. The process known as peen plating was developed by NASA. Fine powders of metals or non-metals are plated onto metal surfaces using glass bead shot as the blast medium. The process has evolved to applying solid lubricants such as <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulphide</b> to surfaces. Biocompatible ceramics have been applied this way to biomedical implants. Peen plating subjects the coating material to high heat in the collisions with the shot and the coating must also be available in powder form, limiting the range of materials that can be used. To overcome the problem of heat, a process called temperature moderated-collision mediated coating (TM-CMC) has allowed the use of polymers and antibiotic materials as peened coatings. The coating is presented as an aerosol directed to the surface {{at the same time as}} a stream of shot particles. The TM-CMC process is still in the R&D phase of development.|$|E
