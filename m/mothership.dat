5|$|As {{the aliens}} finally {{emerge from the}} <b>mothership,</b> they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the <b>mothership,</b> one of the aliens pauses {{for a few moments}} with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{lands on}} the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, {{traveling}} through the planet's caverns. She eventually comes across Kraid, an ally of the Space Pirates, and Ridley, the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Along the way, Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain. However, while Samus leaves the planet in her gunship, it is attacked by Space Pirates, causing it to crash back onto Zebes, near the Space Pirate <b>Mothership.</b> Exploring the <b>Mothership,</b> Samus eventually reaches the Mecha Ridley, a mechanized form of Ridley. After defeating it, Samus escapes the planet using one of the Space Pirate's shuttles, while the <b>Mothership</b> self-destructs.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the <b>mothership.</b> He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the <b>mothership.</b> With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the <b>mothership</b> burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 <b>mothership</b> and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the <b>mothership,</b> and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber <b>mothership.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bethesda's Todd Howard first {{confirmed}} during E3 2008 that downloadable content (DLC) {{would be}} prepared for the Xbox 360 and Windows versions of Fallout 3. There are five DLCs: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and <b>Mothership</b> Zeta, released in that order. Of the five, Broken Steel has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of the main quest line.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the <b>mothership.</b> The model of the <b>mothership</b> is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} four levels, the common enemies and <b>motherships</b> can fire yellow bullets {{that are similar to}} the white bullets fired by the player, except that they travel rather slowly.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2016 American film Independence Day: Resurgence, the Burj Khalifa {{was seen}} where it - {{along with many}} other {{structures}} - is being thrown into London by the aliens using their <b>mothership's</b> anti-gravity pull.|$|R
50|$|Small {{ships of}} all kinds can be piggybacked on larger ships. Examples include lifeboats, landing craft, and minesweepers on <b>motherships,</b> as well as Midget {{submarines}} on larger submarines, such as those used for the 1942 Japanese submarine attack on Sydney.|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN <b>mothership</b> and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 knots, 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive at up to 650km/h (350 knots, 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 knots, 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a <b>mothership</b> increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, the Vorticon <b>mothership</b> has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen {{journeys}} {{to the ship}} to find and deactivate each of the cannons. Keen does so by fighting more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's control. At {{the end of the}} episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.|$|E
5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the <b>mothership</b> while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The <b>mothership</b> is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E
50|$|After making planet-fall and {{disembarking}} {{the delegation}} from Earth enters their {{portion of the}} habitat. The shuttle carrying the Dregocian delegation malfunctions and crashes, while the delegation from Earth watches in horror. After some tense moments {{and the destruction of}} both the Earth and Dregocian <b>motherships</b> the Earth delegation attempts to figure out what went wrong. The last transmission from the Dregocian shuttle mentioned that it was sabotaged but by whom is the mystery. Before anymore questions can be answered a warhead launched from one of the <b>motherships</b> toward the planet explodes some distance away from the habitat holding the peace accord, damaging the habitat and causing the communications to be broken on both sides.|$|R

50|$|Sea Swift {{started in}} 1987 when founder Sid Faithfull {{identified}} {{an opportunity to}} service Gulf Of Carpentaria fishing fleets by <b>mothershipping</b> from Karumba. Over the next 25 years, Sea Swift grew to become Australia’s largest privately owned shipping company, operating regular freight, <b>mothershipping,</b> project logistics and passenger cruise services from its Cairns headquarters to communities throughout Far North Queensland. Expanding to 20 vessels and five depots, today Sea Swift continues to service remote communities along Cape York Peninsula and in the Gulf of Carpentaria, {{as well as the}} Torres Strait Islands, including Horn Island, Thursday Island and the outer islands. In early 2013, through the acquisition of Tiwi Barge, Sea Swift commenced an operation in the Northern Territory. The initial two-vessel and 15-person operation servicing four destinations grew in 2015 to become an 11-vessel, 110-person operation servicing 17 destinations across the Territory.|$|R
5|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is {{a three-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by Ideas from the Deep (a precursor to id Software) {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1990 for MS-DOS. It is {{the first set of}} episodes of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he retrieves the stolen parts of his spaceship from the cities of Mars, prevents a recently arrived alien <b>mothership</b> from destroying landmarks on Earth, and hunts down the leader of the aliens, the Grand Intellect, on the alien home planet. The three episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Relic Entertainment {{and published by}} Sierra Studios on September 28, 1999, for Microsoft Windows. Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing <b>mothership</b> to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional space within each level rather than being limited to a two-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the <b>mothership</b> compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
5000|$|Raids - Two factions (BCU and ANI) are {{separated}} {{by a series of}} airspaces (maps). Nation Wars involve a constant battle between the two factions to raid and defend these airspaces. A successful raid gaining airspace over the opposing force provides strategic and economical advantages. For example, the boss [...] "Pathos" [...] only spawns in the BCU map [...] "Zaylope Beach"; whoever controls [...] "Zaylope Beach" [...] would have the chance to destroy it and receive its rare drops if [...] "Pathos" [...] should spawn. Battling over these airspaces often results in tens to thousands of NCPs gained for neither or both nations, speeding up the spawning of <b>motherships</b> (see below for <b>motherships).</b> A map being held by a large enemy force means restricted access for lower level players, meaning they can not access and level up in that specific map.|$|R
5|$|The F-84 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft to utilize inflight refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the FICON and Tom-Tom dockings to the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bomber <b>motherships,</b> and the experimental XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop.|$|R
50|$|The Berzerker drones are {{a robotic}} war system with attack drones and <b>motherships</b> to control them. They appear to attack and destroy all not-self spacecraft. The Destiny crew {{speculate}} that their parent civilization is long dead, {{and that they}} just carry out their mission to destroy all non-native technology, destroying other races along the way.|$|R
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its <b>mothership,</b> the starliner Axiom.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien <b>mothership,</b> that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the saucers are positioned.|$|E
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien <b>mothership</b> from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a {{longtime}} Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
50|$|Unknown at the time, a Protoculture matrix {{is buried}} within the {{wreckage}} of the SDF-1. When the Robotech Masters realize that the Zentraedi have failed to retrieve it, they begin a 15-year journey in their <b>motherships</b> to find it themselves. When they arrive in Earth orbit in 2029, it marks the beginning of the Second Robotech War.|$|R
5000|$|Starship - The Goa'uld {{operate a}} variety of starships, {{including}} Ha'tak <b>motherships,</b> Al'kesh bombers, and death glider fighters. The control systems of Goa'uld ships are based on crystals, a feature copied by the Earth ship Prometheus. Since {{the collapse of the}} Goa'uld order in , most of their fleet have fallen {{into the hands of the}} Free Jaffa Nation and the Lucian Alliance.|$|R
25|$|The more {{powerful}} Goa'uld {{are presented as}} controlling multiple planets, armies of Jaffa warriors, and fleets of <b>motherships.</b> They live in luxury, attended by scores of loyal slaves. When one Goa'uld defeats another in battle, the vanquished enemy's domain and forces are typically absorbed by the victor. Sometimes, Goa'uld will ally {{with each other to}} pursue a greater objective; usually these alliances dissolve in treachery as soon as one party senses an advantage.|$|R
