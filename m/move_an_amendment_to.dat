25|$|The Martin {{government}} faced combined {{challenges from}} Quebec separatism and general hostility {{arising from the}} Sponsorship Scandal. The first test of the Liberal minority came following the Speech from the throne on October 5, 2004. The Conservatives announced plans to <b>move</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the speech. In this they were supported by the separatist Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party. The fall of the government was averted only after agreement on a watered-down version of the amendment.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} fight began. The thunderbolts of {{opposition}} were unloosed, and {{the fires of}} political rancour blazed high. Mr. Gresham rose to his legs, and declared to all the world that which he had hitherto kept secret from his own party. It was known afterwards that in discussion with his own dearly-beloved political friend, Lord Cantrip, he had expressed his unbounded anger at the duplicity, greed for power, and want of patriotism displayed by his opponent; but he had acknowledged that the blow had come so quick and so unexpectedly that he thought it better to leave the matter to the House without instruction from himself. He now revelled in sarcasm, and before his speech was over raged into wrath. He would <b>move</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Address for two reasons,--first because this was no moment for bringing before Parliament {{the question of the}} Church establishment, when as yet no well-considered opportunity of expressing itself on the subject had been afforded to the country, and secondly because any measure of reform on that matter should certainly not come to them from the right honourable gentleman opposite. As to the first objection, he should withhold his arguments till the bill suggested had been presented to them. It was in handling the second that he displayed his great power of invective. All those men who then sat in the House, and who on that night crowded the galleries, remember his tones as, turning to the dissenters who usually supported him, and pointing over the table to his opponents, he uttered that well-worn quotation, Quod minime reris,--then he paused, and began again; Quod minime reris,--Graiâ pandetur ab urbe. The power and inflexion of his voice at the word Graiâ were certainly very wonderful. He ended by moving an amendment to the Address, and asking for support equally {{from one side of the}} House as from the other.|$|E

50|$|Adkins {{played a}} cameo {{role in the}} Marconi scandal which broke {{in the summer of}} 1912. It was alleged that highly placed members of H H Asquith’s Liberal government, notably Lloyd George and Rufus Isaacs, had profited by {{improper}} use of information about the Government's intentions with respect to the Marconi Company. Knowing that the government was about to issue a lucrative contract to the British Marconi company, they had bought shares in an American subsidiary. In the end Parliament did not wish to see these ministers brought down over their involvement in an affair from which they had not profited unduly and it was their political judgment rather than their honour which was questioned. Adkins was chosen by the government Whips to <b>move</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> a motion of censure on the issue which accepted the ministers’ expressions of regret and acquitted them of acting in bad faith and of charges of corruption.|$|E
50|$|Sir John Mowbray then <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the {{original}} motion to elect Sir Matthew White Ridley, {{who was then}} seconded by John Lloyd Wharton.|$|R
50|$|In March 1913 he <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the King's Speech, {{calling for}} the {{valuation}} methods to be brought into line with those promised in 1909 - 10.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Bethell <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the 1998 European Parliamentary Elections Bill in the House of Lords {{to make a}} {{provision}} {{for the right to}} vote, but it was defeated by the Labour Government, supported by the Liberal Democrats.|$|R
50|$|In July 1917, he <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Finance Bill {{which would}} have given a {{reduction}} in the income tax paid on the returns from investments made within the Empire.Later that month he was appointed to the Commons select committee on finance.|$|R
50|$|In March 1844 Ashley <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Factory Bill {{limiting}} the working hours of adolescents to ten hours after Sir James Graham had introduced a Bill aiming {{to limit their}} working hours to twelve hours. Ashley's amendment was passed by eight votes, {{the first time the}} Commons had approved of the Ten Hour principle. However, in a later vote his amendment was defeated by seven votes and the Bill was withdrawn. Later that month Graham introduced another Bill which again would limit the employment of adolescents to twelve hours. Ashley supported this Bill except that he wanted ten hours not twelve as the limit. In May he <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> limit the hours worked to ten hours but this was lost by 138 votes.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, Forke <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> W.S. Fielding's budget, {{called for}} {{dramatic}} reductions in tariff rates. This was defeated, although two backbench Liberals voted with the Progressives. One year later, Forke refused {{to support a}} similar motion from J.S. Woodsworth which could have brought the government down.|$|R
2500|$|In 1937 {{when the}} draft Constitution of Ireland was being debated in the Dáil, Frank MacDermot, <b>an</b> {{opposition}} politician, <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> substitute [...] "Prime Minister" [...] {{for the proposed}} [...] "Taoiseach" [...] title in the English text of the Constitution. It was proposed to keep the [...] "Taoiseach" [...] title in the Irish language text. The proponent remarked: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1907, Shipman <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Qualification of Women (County and Borough Councils) Bill {{to remove}} the {{exclusion}} of women from being elected chairman of a County Council or as a Mayor of a borough. The Bill eventually became law in 1907 and, inter alia, clarified that women ratepayers were able to be elected to Borough and County Councils.|$|R
25|$|Paul Bryan, the MP for Howden, <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Bill {{that would}} have created a county of East Yorkshire, {{covering}} the rural area of northern Humberside along with Selby and York (and also Flaxton Rural District), leaving a Humberside including Haltemprice, Hull, Grimsby, Scunthorpe and Goole, while Cleethorpes and Grimsby Rural District would have been kept in Lincolnshire. The amendment {{was rejected by the}} House.|$|R
500|$|Chin <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> {{the motion}} {{introduced}} by Jeyaretnam {{so that it}} read: [...] "That this House (1) values {{the importance of the}} Rule of Law; and (2) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all."

25|$|After {{winning a}} spot in the ballot for Private Members Bills in November 1963, Linstead {{introduced}} a Bill to make the cultivation of cannabis illegal. His Bill passed into law. He led the fight against the Government's Bill to abolish resale price maintenance in 1964, believing it to be damaging to small chemists; later he <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> defend the position of chemists which was defeated by only one vote.|$|R
5000|$|While {{originally}} {{devised by}} the Boundary Commissioners in 1885, the division was originally named as 'Birstal', [...] "from {{the name of}} a large ancient parish". The naming of the new division led to a small struggle between the two Houses of Parliament during the passage of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, when Alfred Illingworth (Liberal MP for Bradford) <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> replace 'Birstal' with 'Spen Valley'. Illingworth argued that Birstall contained only one-eighth {{of the population of the}} division, but Spen Valley was a name which represented several important towns, and his amendment was accepted without dissent by the House of Commons. When the Bill reached the House of Lords, the Conservative peer the Earl of Feversham <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> reinstate 'Birstal' claiming the support of the people in the area. The Earl contended that the Spen Valley was an unknown description and [...] "was only remarkable for being the receptacle of all the sewage from Birstal", whereas Birstal was a very important parish. He had support from the Earl of Cranbrook and his amendment was also accepted without dissent.|$|R
50|$|In January 1918, the House of Lords came to {{consider}} the Bill which {{went on to become}} the Representation of the People Act 1918, for the first time introducing a limited women's suffrage. Loreburn <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> delete from the Bill the sections which would give the vote to women, but the Lords were not persuaded and on <b>a</b> division the <b>amendment</b> was lost by 134 votes against to 71 in favour.|$|R
50|$|For {{the last}} few years he has also been campaigning on knife crime and has made various {{proposals}} to tackle this issue in Scotland, including the mandatory reporting of knife attacks by hospitals to the police and the use of hand-held metal detectors at the doors of some pubs and clubs. He successfully <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice Bill which doubled the maximum sentence for carrying a knife in public.|$|R
50|$|Selwyn's {{speech on}} the motion for the second reading of the Ecclesiastical Commission Bill was {{considered}} his best. He spoke {{for a long time}} against the bill, and <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> it. The bill was subsequently withdrawn after a three nights' debate. On 20 February 1861 he divided the house successfully by <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Trustees of Charities Bill. One of his last speeches was on the Reform Bill of 1867, when he advocated that the lodger franchise should be extended to university lodgers in the town of Cambridge.|$|R
50|$|He {{afterwards}} <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} act expire {{with the present}} session of the United States Congress, when by its terms it would not go into effect till April 15, his object being to make it useless. It finally passed by the unsatisfactory vote of 73 to 52. The United States Senate amended it by striking out all but the sections prohibiting British and French public vessels from entering American ports and limiting the act to the next session of Congress. The House of Representatives refused to recede and the bill was lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} was {{presided over by}} the Father of the House, Sir Edward Heath, and was conducted {{by means of a}} conventional parliamentary motion, originally to elect Peter Brooke. He was proposed and seconded by Conservative MPs Sir Michael Neubert and Sir Tom Arnold respectively. When Brooke had made his own speech submitting his candidacy, Conservative MP John Biffen <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the original motion to elect Betty Boothroyd, who was then seconded by Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody. Boothroyd then gave her own speech submitting her candidacy.|$|R
5000|$|When the House of Commons {{met that}} afternoon, Unionist backbenchers Dunbar Barton and William Henry Cross moved and {{seconded}} the 'loyal address' thanking the Queen for the speech. Barton {{noted that some}} had suggested that Salisbury ought to have resigned immediately it became obvious he had lost the election, and also that Liberals {{did not want to}} have a prolonged discussion on their vote of no confidence. As an Irish Unionist member he defended the government's policy on Ireland. H. H. Asquith then <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> add the words: ...|$|R
25|$|His wife, Audrey, {{a former}} {{chairman}} (1969–82) of Great Ormond Street Hospital, spotted {{a letter to a}} newspaper which pointed out that the copyright of Peter Pan, which had been assigned by J. M. Barrie to the hospital, was going to expire {{at the end of that}} year, 1987 (50 years after Barrie's death, the current copyright term). In 1988, Callaghan <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Copyright Designs & Patents Act, then under consideration in the House of Lords, to grant the hospital a right to royalty in perpetuity despite the lapse of copyright, and it was passed by the government.|$|R
50|$|Brown was {{allied with}} the left {{on issues such as}} the grant to members of the Royal family and {{continuing}} National Service. He especially campaigned for compensation to ex-miners suffering from lung diseases, and welcomed moves by the government in 1954 to institute a compensation scheme. In 1956 he argued strongly against a Bill which would allow licensed premises at airports to sell alcohol, saying that there was much evidence of aircraft being endangered by drink-sodden passengers. Brown was specifically concerned with protecting pensioners from increases in the price of cigarettes, and <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the 1956 budget to exempt pensioners from the rise in cigarette duty.|$|R
5000|$|Although Beamish's name {{inspired}} the Private Eye character Sir Bufton Tufton, {{he was not}} actually as {{far to the right}} of the Tory party as that character (who bore a closer resemblance to the likes of Sir Gerald Nabarro, Sir Patrick Wall, Sir Marcus Fox and the general attitudes associated with the Monday Club and its supporters) might have suggested. Beamish was within the party considered a [...] "One Nation Conservative" [...] and as a member of the House of Lords he <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Community Charge ('Poll Tax') legislation to have the charge vary by income rather than being the same rate for all.|$|R
5000|$|Homosexuality was criminalised in New South Wales {{under section}} 79 of the Crimes Act 1900 (consent {{provisions}} were {{dealt with in}} section 78) which stated thus: [...] "Whosoever commits the abominable crime of buggery, or bestiality, with mankind, or with any animal, shall be liable to imprisonment for fourteen years." [...] In 1951, {{with the support of}} Police Commissioner Colin Delaney, who was noted for his obsession against homosexuality, Attorney General Reg Downing <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Act to ensure that [...] "buggery" [...] remained a criminal act [...] "with or without the consent of the person", removing the previously existing legal loophole of consent.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1996, Democratic Party's {{legislator}} James To {{introduced a}} private member's bill to amend section 6 of the Ordinance {{to remove the}} power of the Commissioner of Police to control the extent to which music or speech might be amplified. The Secretary for Security Peter Lai <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> make it more explicit that the Commission of Police would exercise such power only if [...] "he reasonably considers it to be necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public safety or public order". The Secretary for Security's amendment was carried and the 1996 Amendment Ordinance came into effect on 20 December 1996.|$|R
50|$|When the Home Secretary James Chuter Ede {{proposed}} {{altering the}} Bill {{in line with}} the altered recommendations, the sitting MP for Leeds North-East Alice Bacon (supported by George Porter, MP for Leeds Central) <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> alter the name of a division the Boundary Commission had called 'East Central' to 'North East', and altering the division the Boundary Commission had called 'North East' to 'North'. The Government accepted the amendment, as effected in the Representation of the People Act 1948. The Leeds North East division from then consisted of the Burmantofts, Harehills, Potternewton and Richmond Hill wards and had a 1946 electorate of 49,882. The division was considerably smaller in area after changes in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 June 2004, {{during the}} {{discussion}} at the report {{stage in the}} House of Lords, Conservative peer Baroness O'Cathain <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> extend eligibility for civil partnership to blood relatives who had lived together for a minimum period of time. This amendment was passed in the Lords by 148 to 130, a majority of 18. Like the Leigh amendment, opponents considered the O'Cathain <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> wrecking <b>amendment,</b> and like Leigh, O'Cathain herself voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill. Labour Peer Baron Alli, said the amendment was [...] "ill-conceived and does nothing other than undermine {{the purpose of the}} bill", while the gay rights group Stonewall said the amendment was [...] "unworkable and undermined hundreds of years of family law".|$|R
50|$|Unionists {{continued}} {{to demand that}} Ulster be excluded, the solution of partition appealing to Craig; Carson however, as a Dublin man, did not want partition, which would leave 250,000 Southern Unionists {{at the mercy of}} a huge nationalist majority. He was willing to talk partition hoping that Redmond would give up Home Rule rather than agree to it. Redmond underestimated the resilience and strength of their resistance and thought they were bluffing and would accept Home Rule after Parliament passed it. On New Year's Day 1913, Carson <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, to exclude all nine counties of Ulster and was supported in this by Bonar Law, then leader of the Conservative opposition.|$|R
50|$|This Select Committee {{held only}} one brief meeting on 12 May 1880. The Attorney General, Sir Henry James, moved that anyone {{entitled}} to affirm {{to give evidence}} in court was also entitled to affirm instead of taking the Oath in Parliament. Sir John Holker, Conservative MP for Preston, <b>moved</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> reverse this finding, and the committee split down the middle with eight members (seven Conservatives and Charles Henry Hopwood, Liberal MP for Stockport) supporting the amendment and eight (all Liberals) opposing it; on the casting vote of the chairman Spencer Horatio Walpole the amendment was carried. Bradlaugh was not surprised that the Committee had gone against him, and notified the Speaker that he would attend to take the Oath on 21 May.|$|R
