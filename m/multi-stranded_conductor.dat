50|$|Heat {{resistance}} {{is an important}} part of wrapped cable design. Conductors on overhead lines are subject to two different sources of severe temperature excursions: lightning strike and fault current. Lightning strikes produce a large and sudden increase in conductor temperature (from ambient temperature to over 200 °C in less than 40μs) followed by an exponential decay over tens of seconds back to ambient temperature. The amount of energy converted to heat in a lightning strike can be sufficient to melt several strands in a <b>multi-stranded</b> <b>conductor.</b> Fault currents tend to produce longer rise times (ms rather than μs) to somewhat lower temperatures (typically below 200 °C) and with a longer decay time. In order to cope with these temperatures, the sheath of a wrapped fibre optic cable must be made from a high-temperature material or it must be crosslinked to prevent melting. Suppliers will carry testing of their cable to demonstrate that it can survive a number of lightning strikes or fault current episodes.|$|E
40|$|During the {{manufacturing}} process <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductors</b> are subject to compressive force and rotation moments. The current distribution in the <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductors</b> is not uniform and {{is controlled by the}} transverse resistivity. This is mainly determined by the contact resistance at the strand crossovers and inter-strand contact resistance. The surface layer properties, and in particular the crystalline structure and degree of oxidation, are key parameters in determining the transverse resistivity. The experimental set-ups made it possible to find the dependence of contact resistivity as a function of continuous working stresses and cable design. A study based on measurements and numerical simulation is made to identify the contact resistivity functions...|$|R
50|$|After the {{telephone}} company's conversion to digital, he applied {{his knowledge of}} transmission lines and metals {{to the world of}} high fidelity sound, with inventions in the areas of transmission lines, cables connectors, microphones, electronics and loudspeakers. Cardas' cable designs incorporated Litz conductors, in which each strand in a <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductor</b> is insulated. These conductors were composed of multiple gauges (AWG) of copper wire, with each successive gauge having a 1:1.618 ratio between itself and the next. This use of the Golden Ratio in the design of an electrical conductor was granted.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia and New Zealand, {{the colour}} of the {{external}} sheath is usually white but several other colours are available. Wire sizes of from 1 mm² to 6 mm² Cross Sectional Area (CSA) are available with the outer sheath covering a [...] "core" [...] of either a single conductor, twin conductors, twin and earth conductors, or three and earth conductors. Although available in the larger sizes, solid conductors are rarely used with wire sizes greater than 1 mm² CSA, since the small extra expense of <b>multi-stranded</b> <b>conductors</b> is far outweighed by the relative ease of working with them, especially at the points of termination.|$|R
40|$|AC {{losses in}} two, one-meter-long lengths of HTS {{prototype}} <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductors</b> (PMC`s) are {{measured with a}} temperature-difference calorimeter. Both single-phase and three-phase losses are examined with ac currents up to 1, 000 A rms. The calorimeter, designed specifically for these measurements, has a precision of 1 mW. PMC {number_sign} 1 has two helically-wound, non-insulated layers of HTS tape (19 tapes per layer), each layer wrapped with opposite pitch. PMC {number_sign} 2 is identical except for insulation between the layers. The measured ac losses show no significant effect of interlayer insulation and depend on about the third power of the current [...] a result {{in agreement with the}} Bean-Norris model adapted to the double-helix configuration. The three-phase losses are a factor of two higher than those exhibited by a single isolated conductor, indicating a significant interaction between phases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of high-current super-conducting multi-strand cables often lags behind the pre-dictions extrapolated from the {{performance of}} a single strand. Non-uniform distribution of the transport current among the strands is lively discussed as a possible cause. In order to investigate current distribution phenomena, a comprehensive model has been developed for the coupled analysis of electromagnetic and thermo-hydraulic proc-esses in forced-flow cooled superconducting multi-strand cables. The model has been implemented in PSpice. While this work is focused on cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), the technique can readily be adapted to other types of superconducting <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductors</b> or to multi-filamentary composites. In this article we report on the reproduction of experimental results to verify the model, which showed very good agreement. Furthermore, the influence of the magnetic self-field of a conductor and the impact of possible micro-defects in the super-conducting filaments of a strand on the voltage-current characteristic have been studied by applying the presented model.

40|$|Flexible superconducting cables with {{currents}} up to 6 kA {{will be used}} {{to power}} magnets individually in the insertion regions of the LHC. In case of a quench, the currents in these circuits will decay very fast (with time constants of about 200 ms) such that relatively small copper cross sections are sufficient for these busbars. Quench propagation experiments on a prototype cable and corresponding simulations led to a detailed understanding of the quench behavior of these busbars and to recommendations for the design and application of the cable. Simulations of the quench process in a <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductor</b> led to a detailed understanding of the way current crosses from superconducting to pure copper strands and how this affects the quench propagation velocity. At nominal current (6 kA), the quench propagation velocities are high (10 m/s) and the hot spot temperature increases rapidly. In this situation, timely quench detection and energy extraction (current reduction) are vital to prevent damage of circuit components...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{multiphase}} ac losses in four-layer prototype <b>multi-strand</b> <b>conductors</b> (PMCs) wound from EITS tape provided by American Superconductor Corporation. These conductors are prototypes warm dielectric cable designs, such {{as for the}} US Dept. of Energy's Superconductivity Partnership Initiative Project at Detroit Edison, We report on single phase 'two phaset'(no current in Ihe PMC but with an external ac magnetic field generated by the two normal Conductors arranged at the remaining corners of an equilateral triangle forming a three-phase configuration),and balanced three phase losses. Losses were also measured using a set of saddle coils to apply an ac magnetic field to the PMC. The losses were measured {{as a function of}} temperature, frequency, and current. We compare the losses for three PMCs, one (4 LA) wound conventionally with equal pitch angles for all layers and the two others (4 LB and 4 LC) wound to achieve equal current distribution (UCD) among the layers, and thus lower singlephase losses in the operating region. In addition, 4 LC was wound with a newer gcneration tape having a higher critical current. The PMC 4 LC was found to have the lowest single, twophase, and three-phase losses...|$|R
50|$|The three {{submarine}} {{power cables}} installed in 1991 are each rated to carry 1430 A continuously at 350 kV operating voltage. They are constructed with a compacted <b>multi-strand</b> copper <b>conductor</b> {{as a central}} core, with mass-impregnated paper insulation surrounded by a lead sheath. Two layers of galvanised steel wire armour provides strength and mechanical protection. The outer layer of the cable is a serving made from polypropylene rope and the outer diameter is approximately 130 mm. The cables have a 30-minute overload capacity of 1600 A.|$|R
50|$|DSL signals may be {{degraded}} {{by older}} telephone lines, surge protectors, poorly designed microfilters, Repetitive Electrical Impulse Noise, and by long telephone extension cords. Telephone extension cords are typically made with small-gauge, <b>multi-strand</b> copper <b>conductors</b> {{which do not}} maintain a noise-reducing pair twist. Such cable is more susceptible to electromagnetic interference and has more attenuation than solid twisted-pair copper wires typically wired to telephone jacks. These effects are especially significant where the customer's phone line is more than 4 km from the DSLAM in the telephone exchange, which causes the signal levels to be lower relative to any local noise and attenuation. This will {{have the effect of}} reducing speeds or causing connection failures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of eddy current losses in <b>multi-stranded</b> bundle <b>conductors</b> employed in out-runner permanent magnet machines, by adopting an analytical model. The analytical model {{is based on a}} sub-domain field model that solves the two-dimensional magnetostatic problem using the separation of variables technique for each of the non-magnetically permeable machine sub-domains: PM, airgap and slots. The validity and accuracy of the proposed model is verified using finite element analysis and then used to investigate the eddy current losses. The machine considered for the analysis has 36 slots and 42 -poles previously designed for aircraft taxiing. The influence of the number of turns and the conductor cross-sectional area are investigated. It is shown that efficiency can be improved considerably by the choice of multi- stranded bundle conductors...|$|R
40|$|During {{manufacturing}} of <b>multi-strand</b> cables the <b>conductors</b> {{are subjected}} to twisting and pressing which result in a creation of contact regions between individual wires. The resistivity of such contact regions differs from the resistivity of copper or aluminium. In this paper the resistivity is established by comparing measurements of resistivity with simulations using a finite element method. The non-homogeneity of the contact imprint has been accounted for and the presented results show the dependence of the contact resistance on several parameters, including compression force, imprint depth, intersecting angle and stranding pitch...|$|R
40|$|The authors report {{single-phase}} ac loss measurements on 8, 4, and 3 -layer, <b>multi-strand,</b> HTS prototype <b>conductors</b> for power transmission lines. They use both calorimetric and electrical techniques. The {{agreement between the}} two techniques suggests that the interlayer current distribution in one-meter long conductors are representative of those in long conductors. The losses for the 8 and 4 -layer conductors are in rough agreement, with the 8 -layer losses being somewhat lower. The 3 -layer conductor losses are substantially higher [...] probably due to unbalanced azimuthal currents for this configuration...|$|R
