5|$|A {{study on}} the fully aquatic Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and {{digestion}} were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of fish than those of modern aquatic amphibians like salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Tamazight is in {{the middle}} of a dialect {{continuum}} between Riff to its north-east and Shilha to its south-west. The basic lexicon of Tamazight differs markedly from Shilha, and its verbal system is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Riff or Kabyle. Moreover, Tamazight has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha.|$|E
5|$|The three known {{species of}} vampire bats all seem <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> one another than {{to any other}} species. That {{suggests}} that sanguivorous habits (feeding on blood) evolved only once, and the three species share a common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|Woese {{used his}} new rRNA {{comparison}} method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He sequenced {{a variety of}} different species and happened upon a group of methanogens that had vastly different patterns than any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> each other than they were to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the Archaea were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor. Although Archaea are prokaryotic, they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains.|$|E
5|$|A roadway has {{connected}} Benton City to Richland {{since at}} least 1926, while a road with an alignment <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH3. The highway now known as SR224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and Secondary highway numbers, replacing them with Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes.|$|E
5|$|Cricket is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> {{baseball}} {{than many}} other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E

5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter {{than he would have}} liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E

5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli larvae use chemical mimicry to persuade the M. schencki ants that the P. rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between the P. rebeli larvae and other non-kin brood because the P. rebeli larvae are far <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the M. schencki larvae than to any other ant species larvae.|$|E
5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters. The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent the wreckage of the Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that the two groups were related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E

During the present study the crude lipid content was recorded in the range between 09.22 and 16.49  % in poultry viscera, <b>more</b> or less <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the findings of Hasan and Amin (1997).|$|R

5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides.

5|$|Ninox boobook remigialis {{is found}} on the Kai Islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. Stresemann {{described}} it in 1930 from a specimen collected in 1909.

5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed {{his belief in the}} equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E

5|$|Subfossil parrot {{remains were}} later {{excavated}} from grottos on Réunion and reported in 1996. X-rays {{of the two}} existing stuffed Mascarene parrots {{made it possible to}} compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of the Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> {{each other than}} the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted charisma, and Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of the top ten video game politicians.|$|E
