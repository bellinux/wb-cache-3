40|$|The {{implications}} of whether new surfaces in cutting are formed just by plastic flow past the tool or by some fracturelike separation process involving significant surface work, are discussed. Oblique <b>metalcutting</b> is investigated using the ideas {{contained in a}} new algebraic model for the orthogonal machining of metals (Atkins, A. G., 2003, "Modeling <b>Metalcutting</b> Using Modern Ductile Fracture Mechanics: Quantitative Explanations for Some Longstanding Problems," Int. J. Mech. Sci., 45, pp. 373 – 396) in which significant surface work (ductile fracture toughnesses) is incorporated. The model is able to predict explicit material-dependent primary shear plane angles and provides explanations {{for a variety of}} well-known effects in cutting, such as the reduction of at small uncut chip thicknesses; the quasilinear plots of cutting force versus depth of cut; the existence of a positive force intercept in such plots; why, in the size-effect regime of machining, anomalously high values of yield stress are determined; and why finite element method simulations of cutting have to employ a "separation criterion" at the tool tip. Predictions from the new analysis for oblique cutting (including an investigation of Stabler's rule for the relation between the chip flow velocity angle C and the angle of blade inclination i) compare consistently and favorably with experimental results...|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} given of the {{mechanics}} of cutting, ranging from the slicing of thin floppy offcuts (where there is negligible elasticity and no permanent deformation of the offcut) to the machining of ductile metals (where there is severe permanent distortion of the offcut/chip). Materials scientists employ the former conditions to determine the fracture toughness of ‘soft’ solids such as biological materials and foodstuffs. In contrast, traditional analyses of <b>metalcutting</b> are based on plasticity and friction only, and do not incorporate toughness. The machining theories are inadequate {{in a number of}} ways but a recent paper has shown that when ductile work of fracture is included many, if not all, of the shortcomings are removed. Support for the new analysis is given by examination of FEM simulations of <b>metalcutting</b> which reveal that a ‘separation criterion’ has to be employed at the tool tip. Some consideration shows that the separation criteria are versions of void-initiation-growth-and-coalescence models employed in ductile fracture mechanics. The new analysis shows that cutting forces for ductile materials depend upon the fracture toughness as well as plasticity and friction, and reveals a simple way of determining both toughness and flow stress from cutting experiments. Examples are given for a wide range of materials including metals, polymers and wood, and comparison is made with the same properties independently determined using conventional testpieces. Because cutting can be steady state, a new way is presented for simultaneously measuring toughness and flow stress at controlled speeds and strain rates...|$|E

An important prerequisite for a comprehensive simulation of <b>metalcutting</b> processes is the consideration of mechanically and thermally induced workpiece deformation during machining.

40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{health and}} environmental problems caused by using conventional cutting fluid in the metal cutting industry, a new economical and practical approach to minimum quantity of lubrication machining technique is developed. Turning is a widely used metal removal process in manufacturing industry that involves generation of high cutting forces and temperature. Lubrication becomes critical to minimize {{the effects of these}} forces and temperature on cutting tool and work piece. Strained environment is a global problem. In <b>metalcutting</b> industry the use of coolant has become more problematic in terms of both employee {{health and environmental}} pollution. It is said that the use of coolant forms approximately 8 - 16 % of the total production costs. Development of lubricants that is eco-friendly and economically is acquiring importance. In this context, using minimum quantity of lubrication of boric acid mixed with base oil SAE 40 {{has proved to be a}} feasible alternative to the conventional cutting fluid. In the present work 10 % boric acid by weight mixed with base oil SAE 40 is used as a MQL in turning process. Variations in cutting (lubricant) force, cutting temp, chip thickness and surface roughness are studied under different machining conditions. The results indicate that there is a considerable improvement in machining performance with MQL assisted machining compared to dry machining...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficiency}} of the cutting method with outstripping plastic deformation (OPD) in lathe works is defined in many respects by design features of the add-on devices for mechanical hardening of a cut-off layer material {{in the course of}} cutting. Applied on lathes, deforming OPD devices can have differing dimensions, placement on the lathe, drive type (manual, electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, pneumohydraulic, electromagnetic), and autonomy degree towards the <b>metalcutting</b> equipment and industrial equipment. At the same time {{there are a number of}} inherent design features of work-hardening devices the modernized lathes with OPD use for machining. Now the OPD standard devices implement two principle construction options: loading device is placed on the machine or on the OPD slide support separate of the tool, or it is structurally aligned with the cutting tool. In the latter case the OPD device for turning is called a tool mandrel, which is mounted in a tool post of the machine or, at large dimensions, such a mandrel is mounted on the machine instead of the tool mandrel. When designing the OPD devices, is important to take into consideration production requirements and recommendations for the technological equipment, developed in the course of creation, working off and introduction of such installations for mechanical hardening of material. In compliance with it, OPD devices, their placement on the machine, and working displacements shouldn't limit technological capabilities of the applied metal-cutting equipment. OPD stresses have to be smoothly regulated, with maximum loads being limited to admissible values for the machine model to be modernized. It is necessary to ensure synchronized longitudinal and cross displacements of the cutting tool and OPD hardener with respect to the axis of billet rotation to enable regulation and readjustment of the hardener and tool placement. It ought to foresee the increased mobile components rigidity and manufacturing accuracy of a device to exclude unexpected displacements of hardener with respect to the surface of cutting. The article also gives main recommendations to choose design parameters of the crush rolls for OPD. Taking into consideration the above production requirements and recommendations to design the turning devices with OPD allows us to create technological equipment to provide high {{efficiency of}} a method. The equipment is convenient for work, simple and cheap in the production, available for repair and replacement of worn-out constructive components, and safe in operation as well. </p...|$|E
