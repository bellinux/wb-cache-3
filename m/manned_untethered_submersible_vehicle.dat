This thesis investigated the possibility of maritime domain terrorism threats {{and what could be}} done to prevent such attacks as modeled on the basis of system of systems. Only certain terrorist groups have the capability to launch maritime terrorist attacks. The terrorist motives are to spread their political message, responding to what they have perceived as oppression. The system of systems model suggests (and is validated) that container vessels and cruise ships are potential targets, with possible human and economic consequences. However, these maritime targets failed to match the terrorist groups objectives. Political assets such as warships and land-based maritime infrastructure align well to terrorist motives. Enhanced security measures protecting military and maritime infrastructure may require terrorists to use uncommon forms of attack.

For the observations, {{they are}} dropped from ships and self land on the flat sea floor where generally thick sediments cover basement rocks. However, soft sediment affects and distorts incoming seismic signals. If we could place ocean bottom seismometers on hard rock, it could produce high quality seismograms which contained more information on structure and earthquake sources. For this purpose, a <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> is necessary as it can carry and place an OBS properly on exposed sea floor hard rock.

40|$|In {{the current}} version of NPSNET there are two {{problems}} that prevent users of this virtual environment from achieving a realistic training experience. First, the motion of the vehicles is not built around realistic, physically based models. In particular, the motion of computer-generated sea-going vehicles is not based on the hydrodynamic models that reflect the motion of actual ships moving through water. Second, vehicles in NPSNET are currently controlled by a single individual; they lack the capability to be controlled by a team. This misrepresents the many actual military vehicles—submarines, tanks, helicopters, and others— that must be controlled by several people working together. The approach taken was to update the <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> class in NPSNET in two ways. A physically-based hydrodynamic model was used to control the vehicle's motion through the virtual world. In addition, a network communications protocol was implemented to enable several remote individuals to control the same vehicle simultaneously. The result of this work is the creation of a computer-generated <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> whose motion is determined by a real-time hydrodynamic model so it moves through the virtual world according to physically based models. This submersible is also capable of being controlled by several remote individuals—effectively the same team members who would perform the job in the actual vehicle.
