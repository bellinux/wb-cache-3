40|$|Abstract: No single {{definition}} covers spasticity � uncontrolled {{muscle spasms}} caused when motor nerves cannot {{communicate with the}} brain. Most agree that these characteristics point to spasticity: Increased muscle tone or firmness, exaggerated stretch reflexes, uncontrolled movements, altered posture, and interference with walking (if person is walking). Muscle spasms that come from muscle cramping, torn muscles, or lower-back pain are not spasticity. Health professionals think that {{a certain amount of}} spasticity in people with spinal cord injury is normal and healthy. Movement, for instance, even if uncontrolled, helps maintain muscle <b>mass</b> and <b>tone.</b> Spasms also put pressure on bones and help maintain bone density. The rapid circulation of blood that occurs during spasms increases blood flow and can decrease the change of blood clots. For some, spasms can be triggered to assist in chair-to-bed transfer and standing. Spasticity challenges are pain, sleep disruption, difficulty with breathing (if affecting chest muscles), movement difficulty, fatigue, bladder and bowel problems, muscle/bone/joint distortion, scrapes that can turn into pressure sores, and intimacy problems. Stress and loss of self-esteem are also byproducts of spasticity...|$|R

With the loss of bone mass progressing at up to two percent per month, long duration and interplanetary missions shall remain the sole duty of robotic explorers until sufficient countermeasures are developed. Several countermeasures are either in use, or under development to alleviate this problem. Exercise is currently used to reduce the severity of bone loss and muscle atrophy. Exercise has proven ineffective despite the fact two hours of daily exercise together with elaborate apparatus have been devoted to simulating the load of Earth's gravity. Drug therapy and other, more exotic, countermeasures are also under consideration, but the side-effects of these other treatments {{and the fact that}} they do not directly address the root cause of the negative effects of weightlessness means that they may only reduce, not cure, those problems.

40|$|Sarcopenia is a {{prevalent}} {{disease in}} elderly (13 - 24 %), peaking in patients over 85 years of age. In spite of sharing some age-related anatomo functional alterations with muscular apparatus, several pathogenetic mechanisms are independent on aging itself, leading {{to frame the}} disease as a true geriatric syndrome, {{also in terms of}} comorbidity, disability and overall mortality. The current definition addresses the disease as a progressive loss of muscular <b>mass,</b> strength and <b>tone,</b> lacking of at least a fundamental issue; the disease is almost reversible if diagnosed with promptness. It definitely paves the way to challenging approaches in terms of primary and secondary prevention, able to restrain the disability related to osteo-sarco-dynapenia as well as its outgrowing socioeconomic burden. Moreover, new pathophysiological insights in the field are focusing interesting therapeutic targets (genetic therapy on stem cells commitment or myostatin inhibition as well as hormonal therapy with SERM) enlarging the disease therapeutic conceptual framework.

Now, as it will only do so when it is seen at a considerable distance, it is necessary that it should be visible, or, at least, that its presence should be indicated, over a considerable portion of surrounding space. It must not, therefore, be too much shaded by trees, or it will be useless; but if, on the contrary, it be too conspicuous on the open hillside, it will be liable to most of the objections which were advanced against the Swiss cottage, and to another, which was not then noticed. Anything which, to the eye, is split into parts, appears less as a whole than what is undivided. Now, a considerable <b>mass,</b> of whatever <b>tone</b> or color it may consist, is as easily divisible by dots as by lines; that is, a conspicuous point, on any part of its surface, will divide it into two portions, each of which will be individually measured by the eye, but which will never make the impression which they would have made, had their unity not been interrupted. A conspicuous cottage on a distant mountain side has this effect in a fatal degree, and is, therefore, always intolerable.|$|R

Such a prospect as this is always compatible with as much concealment as we choose. In all these pieces of management, the architect's chief enemy is the vanity of his employer, who will always want to see more than he ought to see, and than he will have pleasure in seeing, without reflecting how the spectators pay for his peeping.|$|R

40|$|As a {{starting}} point, the group defined a {{primary goal of}} maintaining in flight a level of systemic oxygen transport capacity comparable to each individual's preflight upright baseline. The goal of maintaining capacity at preflight levels {{would seem to be}} a reasonable objective for several different reasons, including the maintenance of good health in general and the preservation of sufficient cardiovascular reserve capacity to meet operational demands. It is also important not to introduce confounding variables in whatever other physiological studies are being performed. A change in the level of fitness is likely to be a significant confounding variable in the study of many organ systems. The principal component of the in-flight cardiovascular exercise program should be large-muscle activity such as treadmill exercise. It is desirable that at least one session per week be monitored to assure maintenance of proper functional levels and to provide guidance for any adjustments of the exercise prescription. Appropriate measurements include evaluation of the heart-rate/workload or the heart-rate/oxygen-uptake relationship. Respiratory gas analysis is helpful by providing better opportunities to document relative workload levels from analysis of the interrelationships among VO 2, VCO 2, and ventilation. The committee felt that there is no clear evidence that any particular in-flight exercise regimen is protective against orthostatic hypotension during the early readaptation phase. Some group members suggested that maintenance of the lower body muscle <b>mass</b> and muscle <b>tone</b> may be helpful. There is also evidence that late in-flight interventions to reexpand blood volume to preflight levels are helpful in preventing or minimizing postflight orthostatic hypotension...|$|R

The purpose was to compare the guitars and establish if {{there was a significant difference}} and what it was, in the guitars ability to produce sound. The thought was also to try the thesis: loud but short, long but moderate tone. Also if a lighter built guitar has {{an advantage}} in producing a loud but short ton and vice versa. The instruments has been examined by five guitarist, one guitarbuilder and a professor in Speech, music and hearing at KTH in Stockholm.

A lot of guitarists wish is to get louder instruments but if you ad one thing and are forced to lose another the guitarist will not be happy anyway.

40|$|Body image {{refers to}} an individual's {{internal}} representation ofhis/her outer self (Cash, 1994; Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, & Tantleff-Dunn, 1999). It is a multidimensional construct which includes an individual's attitudes towards hislher own physical characteristics (Bane & McAuley, 1998; Cash, 1994; Cash, 2004; Davison & McCabe, 2005; Muth & Cash, 1997; Sabiston, Crocker, & Munroe-Chandler, 2005). Social comparison {{is the process of}} thinking about the self in relation to others in order to determine if one's opinions and abilities are adequate and to assess one's social status (Festinger, 1954; Wood, 1996). Research investigating the role of social comparisons on body image has provided some information on the types and nature of the comparisons that are made. The act of making social comparisons may {{have a negative impact on}} body image (van den Berg et ai., 2007). Although exercise may improve body image, the impact of social comparisons in exercise settings may be less positive, and there may be differences in the social comparison tendencies between non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers. The present study examined the nature of social comparisons that female collegeaged non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers made with respect to their bodies, and the relationship of these social comparisons to body image attitudes. Specifically, the frequency and direction of comparisons on specific tal-gets and body dimensions were examined in both non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers. Finally, the relationship between body-image attitudes and the frequency and direction with which body-related social comparisons were made for non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers were examined. One hundred and fifty-two participants completed the study (n = 70 non or ill infrequent exercisers; n = 82 exercisers). Participants completed measures of social physique anxiety (SPA), body dissatisfaction, body esteem, body image cognitions, leisure time physical activity, and social comparisons. Results suggested that both groups (non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers) generally made social comparisons and most frequently made comparisons with same-sex friends, and least frequently with same-sex parents. Also, both groups made more appearance-related comparisons than non-appearance-related comparisons. Further, both groups made more negative comparisons with almost all targets. However, non or infrequent exercisers generally made more negative comparisons on all body dimensions, while exercisers made negative comparisons only on weight and body shape dimensions. MANOV As were conducted to examine if any differences on social comparisons between the two groups existed. Results of the MANOVAs indicated that frequency of comparisons with targets, the frequency of comparisons on body dimensions, and direction of comparisons with targets did not differ based on exercise status. However, the direction of comparison of specific body dimensions revealed a significant (F (7, 144) = 3. 26,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 132) difference based on exercise status. Follow-up ANOVAs showed significant differences on five variables: physical attractiveness (F (1, 150) = 6. 33,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 041); fitness (F(l, 150) = 11. 89,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 073); co-ordination (F(I, 150) = 5. 61,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 036); strength (F(I, dO) = 12. 83,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 079); muscle <b>mass</b> or <b>tone</b> (F(l, 150) = 17. 34,p <. 05; 1] 2 = 1. 04), with exercisers making more positive comparisons than non or infrequent exercisers. The results from the regression analyses for non or infrequent exercisers showed appearance orientation was a significant predictor of the frequency of social comparisons N (B =. 429, SEB =. 154, / 3 =. 312,p <. 01). Also, trait body image measures accounted for significant variance in the direction of social comparisons (F(9, 57) = 13. 43,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 68). Specifically, SPA (B = -. 583, SEB =. 186, / 3 = -. 446,p <. 01) and body esteem-weight concerns (B =. 522, SEB =. 207, / 3 =. 432,p <. 01) were significant predictors of the direction of comparisons. For exercisers, regressions revealed that specific trait measures of body image significantly predicted the frequency of comparisons (F(9, 71) = 8. 67,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 463). Specifically, SPA (B =. 508, SEB =. 147, / 3 =. 497,p <. 01) and appearance orientation (B =. 457, SEB =. 134, / 3 =. 335,p <. 01) were significant predictors of the frequency of social comparisons. Lastly, for exercisers, the results for the regression of body image measures on the direction of social comparisons were also significant (F(9, 70) = 14. 65,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 609) with body dissatisfaction (B =. 368, SEB =. 143, / 3 =. 362,p <. 05), appearan. ce orientation (B =. 256, SEB =. 123, / 3 =. 175,p <. 05), and fitness orientation (B =. 423, SEB =. 194, / 3 =. 266,p <. 05) significant predictors of the direction of social comparison. The results indicated that young women made frequent social comparisons regardless of exercise status. However, exercisers m,a de more positive comparisons on all the body dimensions than non or infrequent exercisers. Also, certain trait body image measures may be good predictors of one's body comp~son tendencies. However, the measures which predict comparison tendencies may be different for non or infrequent exercisers and exercisers. Future research should examine the effects of social comparisons in different populations (i. e., males, the obese, older adults, etc.). Implications for practice and research were discussed...|$|R
