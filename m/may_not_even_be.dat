5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> noticed when contact is made. Teeth may {{remain in the}} wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, {{which is similar to}} tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|If the formats have {{approximately}} the same aspect ratios, the characteristic dimensions can be the format diagonals; if the aspect ratios differ considerably (e.g., 4×5 vs. 6×17), the dimensions must be chosen more carefully, and the DOF comparison <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> meaningful.|$|E
25|$|A variant form {{usually has}} a very similar {{appearance}} and meaning as its base form. The mechanism is intended for variant forms where, generally, if the variant form is unavailable, displaying the base character {{does not change the}} meaning of the text, and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> noticeable by many readers.|$|E

25|$|Scale morphology, alone, {{has limited}} value for {{distinguishing}} thelodont species. Within each organism, scale shape varies greatly according to body area, with intermediate scale forms appearing between different areas; furthermore, scale morphology <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> constant {{within a given}} body area. To confuse things further, scale morphologies are not unique to specific taxa, and may be indistinguishable on the same area of two different species.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} neural tube {{transformation}} into structures {{that will eventually}} develop into {{the central nervous system}} is known as neurulation, the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception, and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences {{in the development of the}} fetus.|$|E
25|$|Cultural Mormon is a {{term used}} for Mormons who no longer believe some, or many, of the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), but who self-identify as Mormon. Usually, this {{is a result of}} having been raised in the LDS Church or having {{converted}} and spent a large portion of one's life as {{an active member of the}} LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church, and in some cases <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> official members of the church.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{theoretical}} {{upper limit}} {{to the size of}} districts in STV, and they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> needed at all: Thomas Hare's original proposal was for a single, nationwide district. In theory, STV could allow for the election of particularly small minorities provided they secure a quota's worth of votes, if very large districts were used. The 1925 Irish Senate election used one district to elect nineteen places and the Cork Corporation used a single 21-seat local electoral area until subdivided in time for the 1967 local election.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of M. vivesi are other New World species of Myotis {{which are not}} adapted to piscivory, {{rather than the other}} piscivorous bats in the genus. This indicates that the adaptations to catching fish in M. vivesi and other species are the result of convergent evolution. No fossils attributable to M. vivesi have been discovered. A fossil species of Pizonyx, Pizonyx wheeleri, was named by Walter Dalquest and Daniel Patrick in 1993 from the Miocene of Texas, but according to a 1993 review by Nicholas Czaplewski, this species instead belongs to the genus Antrozous and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> distinct from the living species Antrozous pallidus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of sign {{language in the}} region, including many pockets of home sign and local sign languages, such as Ghandruk Sign Language, Jhankot Sign Language, and Jumla Sign Language in Nepal, and Alipur Sign Language in India, which appear to be language isolates. There are also various Sri Lankan sign languages which <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal (Nepalese Sign Language), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for Nepalese Sign Language at least, {{it is not clear}} whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.|$|E

Their bodies were later recovered, and jewelry belonging to one of the girls was later found in Schaefer's home.|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{arbitrarily}} {{many elements}} may be inserted into a linked list, {{limited only by}} the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying array data structure {{and will have to}} reallocate— an expensive operation, one that <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and the cost of an insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.|$|E
25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, 2004, the governor's office {{announced}} that the signature span concept had been scrapped, with the bridge to be the simple viaduct originally proposed. The design, having gone full circle, remained expensive due to the continued high cost of materials. Many argued {{that there would be}} little difference in final cost with this lesser proposal since that concept required obtaining new permits, perhaps adding another two or three years; furthermore, a viaduct <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> able to obtain Coast Guard approval, since the maximum width of the ship channel would be reduced by almost half. Local reaction to this announcement was intense, with most suggesting that the bridge be built to appear as proposed— either in the steel material as bid or using a reinforced concrete tower of similar appearance but of lower cost.|$|E

50|$|The riddles themselves, {{written in}} tercets of dactylic hexameters, are of elegant Latinity. The author's brief preface states {{that they were}} written to form part of the {{entertainment}} at the Saturnalia.

25|$|EIPH reduces a horse's racing performance. Severe EIPH (epistaxis) shortens a horse's racing career. Moderate {{to severe}} EIPH is {{associated}} with a worsened finishing position in a race, and finishing farther behind the winner. Horses with mild EIPH earn more prize money than those with more severe EIPH. While single bouts of EIPH <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> apparent to the rider, owner or trainer of a horse unless an endoscopic examination is undertaken, the effect on performance within a single race appears to be significant but relatively subtle. In a 2005 study, horses finishing races with grade 4 EIPH were on average 6 metres behind those finishing with grade 0. However, the effect of repeated bouts of EIPH that occur with daily training may lead to more significant changes and a greater degree of tissue damage over time with consequent loss of lung function.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which {{can be caused by}} sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive inflation adjustment for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E

Prolific and popular writers such as Ali Bulaç, Rasim Özdenören, and Ismet Özel have drawn upon their knowledge of Western philosophy, Marxist sociology, and radical Islamist political theory to advocate a modern Islamic perspective that does not hesitate to criticize genuine societal ills while simultaneously remaining faithful to the ethical values and spiritual dimensions of religion. Islamist intellectuals are harshly critical of Turkey's secular intellectuals, whom they fault for trying to do in Turkey what Western intellectuals did in Europe: substitute worldly materialism, in its capitalist or socialist version, for religious values.|$|E
25|$|Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the {{descendants}} of Sephardi Jewish nominal converts (conversos) to Catholicism who immigrated to the New World escaping the Spanish Inquisition in Spain and Portugal.

Their numbers are difficult to ascertain as most are at least nominally Catholic, having been converted by force or coercion, or married into the religion. Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin America is in the millions. Most would be of mixed ancestry, although a few claim some communities may have been able to maintain a degree of endogamy (marrying only other Crypto-Jews) throughout the centuries. They may or may not consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> aware of it.

25|$|Theism {{generally}} {{holds that}} God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and {{interacting with the}} universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present {{in the affairs of}} the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, {{due to the nature of}} time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism.Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it. In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.|$|E
