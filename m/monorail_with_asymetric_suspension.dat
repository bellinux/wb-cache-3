40|$|We {{propose a}} {{hierarchical}} segmentation algorithm {{that starts with}} a very fine oversegmentation and gradually merges regions using a cascade of boundary classifiers.

On six segmentation data sets, our algorithm achieves best performance under most region-quality measures, and does it with fewer segments than the prior work. Our algorithm is also highly competitive in a dense oversegmentation (superpixel) regime under boundary-based measures. 1...|$|R

40|$|The credit {{crisis of}} 2007 - 2009 can be partly {{explained}} by the perverse incentives provided by both income and tax policies. Income policies {{have been designed to}} address the principal-agent problem but have ended up giving a strong incentive to maximize short term profits. Combined <b>with</b> <b>asymetric</b> pay-off structures, it led to risk-lover behaviors that turned to be detrimental to the organizations and their stakeholders. Tax policies have promoted indebtness through the tax deductibility of interest charges for coroporations and of mortgage for households. Differences in tax treatment have also led to the substitution of more lightly taxed stock options and capital gains to regular remunerations. A side effect of this arbitrage has been to reinforce risk-taking behaviors. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

MonoMetro claims its system would be cheaper to introduce than a tram as it would not be necessary to divert or strengthen sewers along its route and that it is also superior to monorail systems.|$|R
50|$|W.J. Ewing {{implemented}} a <b>monorail</b> system, <b>with</b> only one rail and double flanged rail wheels, {{that had been}} proposed by William Thorold in a lecture to the British Association in 1868. This system avoided all those problems, since it was laid out {{along the side of}} a road, it took up very little land. Further, the road or balance wheel's main purpose was to balance the train and to keep it upright. The balancing wheel on the road carried only 4% or 5% of the load, it did not subtract much from the steel wheel-steel rail efficiency. As the track was on side of the road, it was no obstacle to vehicles crossing it. Further, since it was a <b>monorail</b> <b>with</b> a supporting wheel on the ground, the issue of curve resistance did not arise in Ewing System, since the wheels were placed on a single track only.|$|R

Special automatic brakes were installed in carriages not to let them run down in case of cable damage. The length of funicular is 142 m, gradient - 29.5 degrees.
