With that in mind, {{the current study}} investigates the occurrence of plasmid-encoded <b>multidrug</b> <b>resistances</b> in Salmonella and Shigella from diarrheal cases among humans. The isolates were characterized by serotyping, antimicrobial-susceptibility testing, transfer experiments and curing. The extended spectrum &# 946;-lactamase (ESBL) was detected by the double disc diffusion synergy test (DDST). A signifcant number of the plasmid-encoded multidrug resistant (PEMDR) Salmonella and Shigella isolates were found to harbour transferable plasmid genes resistant to antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime {{and to a lesser}} extent to ciprofoxacin and ofoxacin. The conjugative R-plasmids-encoded extended-spectrum &# 946;-lactamase also showed resistances to cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefuroxime) and ampicillin. Curing experiments showed chromosomal resistances to varied antibiotics. The fndings confrmed the presence of PEMDR in Salmonella and Shigella strains as a suitable adaptation to a changing antibiotic environment. The results therefore suggest the limited use of the commonly prescribed/or third generation cephalosporins as an empirical treatment of multidrug resistant Salmonella and Shigella because this may affect therapeutic outcomes...|$|R

25|$|To {{achieve these}} targets, China needs to address {{existing}} challenges to {{its efforts to}} control tuberculosis. Foremost is the serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis.

The recent expansion of DOTS should help to limit the development of MDR tuberculosis.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of antibiotics}} can lead to antibiotic resistance {{in the treatment of}} infections caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The presence of integrons in Pseudomonas is clearly associated with <b>multidrug</b> <b>resistances.</b> Therefore, this study aimed at tracking class I, II and III integrons of antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from nosocomial infection. Materials and Methods: In this study, 51 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different wards of Imam Khomeini hospital of Ahvaz since October of 2014 until March of 2015. After identification test and antibigram, coding genes of antibiotic resistance and class I, II and III integrons were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results: Tetracycline revealed the most resistance with 84 % frequency in discreted isolates. In the encoding antibiotic resistance genes with a frequency of 94 % was the most common blaTEM. Class I integron had 92 % prevalence, class II Integron showed 52 % prevalence and class III Integron demonstrated 17 % prevalence. Conclusions: In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, class I integron was more prevalent than other integrons and the integrase gene {{was probably one of the}} causes of multiple antibiotic resistance in this bacteria.

Dapsone (Avlosulfon) is the most widely used sulfone for the long-term therapy of leprosy. Although the sulfones are highly effective against most strains of M. leprae, a small number of organisms, especially those found in lepromatous leprosy patients, are less susceptible and can persist for many years, resulting in relapse.

25|$|Despite these achievements, {{there were}} signs of {{difficulties}} elsewhere in the country's tuberculosis control program. In the half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of tuberculosis did not fall during the 1990s. Thus, the fall in tuberculosis prevalence for the entire country slowed to 2.5% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national tuberculosis survey revealed that one in ten patients with tuberculosis had multi-drug resistant (MDR) disease — i.e., resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin.

30|$|So far, {{a little}} {{attention}} has been paid to the antimicrobial activity of the siderophores themselves. For instance, Siderophore of the yeast Aureobasidium pullulans displayed potential antimicrobial activities against Vibrio anguillarum and V. parahaemolyticus; two pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased animals (Wang et al. 2009). A recent study highlighted the wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of a siderophore, produced by Endophytic Fungus Acremonium sclerotigenum, against B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (Prathyusha et al. 2015). On the contrary, much researches have been devoted for using siderophores as antibiotic conjugates complex to achieve better drug delivery systems in medical applications (Page 2013). Taking into account that there exists a little bit antimicrobial activity associated with the siderophore component of these complexes when being used as carriers. Duration of the potential antimicrobial activity encountered in the tested siderophore is a crucial issue. In this regard, SID EGYII exhibited a long last antimicrobial activity till 48  h and probably beyond this time. This in turn gains SID EGYII a privilege over deferoxamine that was reported to display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus after repeated additions of deferoxamine in the growth medium after 24  h (Hartzen et al. 1989). Hence, the wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of SID EGYII alongside its long lasting antimicrobial activity might indicate the high potential of SID EGYII to target certain pathogens that have implicated in human and plant pathogenesis; particularly those displaying <b>multidrug</b> <b>resistances.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>Multidrug</b> drug <b>resistance</b> (MDR) {{phenotype}} {{is a major}} limitation to chemotherapy. The MDR phenotype {{arises when}} class I P-glycoproteins (P-gps) are overexpressed in cultured cells in vitro and in tumor cells in vivo. P-gps are encoded in rodents by three genes: mdr 1, mdr 2 and mdr 3. Class I P-gps (Mdrl, Mdr 3) confer drug resistance upon transfection in non-resistant cells and act as ATP dependent drug efflux pumps, class II P-gps (Mdr 2) do not convey MDR but act as lipid flippases in the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. P-gps are composed of twelve transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding sites. The membrane spanning domains (MSD) of Pgp show {{the lowest level of}} similarity amongst family members and are postulated to be responsible for the different substrate specificities of the two classes of P-gp. In this study, chimeric cDNAs were constructed between class I and class II P-gps.

40|$|Background: Although leprosy is {{efficiently}} {{treated by}} <b>multidrug</b> therapy, <b>resistance</b> to first-line (dapsone, rifampin) and to second-line drugs (fluoroquinolones) was described worldwide. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, phenotypic susceptibility testing requires a one year {{experiment in the}} mouse model and this is rarely performed. Genetics on antibiotic resistance {{provide the basis for}} molecular tests able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Methodology/Principal Findings: A reverse hybridization DNA strip test was developed as the GenoType LepraeDR test.

The performances of the GenoType LepraeDR test were evaluated by comparing its results on 120 M. leprae strains, previously studied for resistance by the reference drug in vivo susceptibility method in the mouse footpad and for mutations in the gene regions described above by PCR-sequencing.

40|$|Escherichia coli clonal group A (CGA) {{commonly}} {{exhibits a}} distinctive <b>multidrug</b> antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> phenotype—i. e., resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim (ACSSuTTp) —and has accounted {{for up to}} 50 % of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant E. coli urinary tract infections in some locales. Annotation of the whole-genome sequencing of UMN 026, a reference CGA strain, clarified the genetic basis for this strain's ACSSuTTp antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Most of the responsible genes were clustered in a unique 23 -kbp chromosomal region, designated the genomic resistance module (GRM), which occurred within a 105 -kbp genomic island situated at the leuX tRNA. The GRM is characterized by numerous remnants of mobilization and rearrangement events suggesting multiple horizontal transfers. Additionally, comparative genomic analysis of the leuX tRNA genomic island in 14 sequenced E. coli genomes showed that this region is a hot spot of integration, with the presence/absence of specific subregions being uncorrelated with either the phylogenetic group or the pathotype. Our data illustrate the importance of whole-genome sequencing in the detection of genetic elements involved in antimicrobial resistance.

40|$|Levofloxacin is a {{synthetic}} broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for oral or intravenous administration. Chemically, levofloxacin is the levorotatory isomer (L-isomer) of racemate ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. Quinolone derivatives rapidly and specifically inhibit {{the synthesis of}} bacterial DNA. Levofloxacin has in vitro activity against {{a broad range of}} aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, formulation of combined poloxamers thermoregulated (as Pluronic® F 127) and levofloxacin for use in multiresistant bacterial treatment were poorly described in the current literature. Thus, the aim of the present work is to characterize poloxamers for levofloxacin controlled release and their use in the treatment of <b>multidrug</b> bacterial <b>resistance.</b> Micelles were produced in colloidal dispersions, with a diameter between 5 and 100 [*]nm, which form spontaneously from amphiphilic molecules under certain conditions as concentration and temperature. Encapsulation of levofloxacin into nanospheres showed efficiency and enhancement of antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae when compared with only levofloxacin. Furthermore, all formulations were not cytotoxic for NIH/ 3 T 3 cell lineage. In conclusion, poloxamers combined with levofloxacin have shown promising results, better than alone, decreasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of the studied bacterial multiresistance strains. In the future, this new formulation will be used after being tested in animal models in patients with resistant bacterial strains...|$|R
