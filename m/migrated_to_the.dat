5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, a group of MacAulays <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former counties of Caithness and Sutherland. William Buchanan of Auchmar's 18th-century account of the surname MacAulay stated that a group of MacAulays in Caithness claimed to descend from the MacAulays of Ardincaple.|$|E
5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns. The Cherokee were forced to cede most of their lands in this area through a series of unfavorable treaties with the United States, and they <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{euryhaline}} species is the bull shark, which lives in Lake Nicaragua of Central America and the Zambezi River of Africa. Both these habitats are fresh water, yet bull sharks will also <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> and from <b>the</b> ocean. Specifically, Lake Nicaragua bull sharks <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and Zambezi bull sharks <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean.|$|R

50|$|Austronesians began <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Malay Archipelago {{approximately}} 3,500 {{years before}} present. It is now accepted that Taiwan is {{the cradle of}} Austronesian languages. Some 4,000 years ago, Austronesian began <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines.

5|$|Filipinos {{generally}} {{belong to}} several Asian ethnic groups classified linguistically {{as part of}} the Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian speaking people. It is believed that thousands of years ago Austronesian-speaking Taiwanese aborigines <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines from Taiwan, bringing with them knowledge of agriculture and ocean-sailing, eventually displacing the earlier Negrito groups of the islands.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic Americans {{who lived}} in the {{mainland}} benefited from the sudden economic boom {{as a result of the}} war, and the doors opened for many of the migrants who were searching for jobs.

5|$|A {{new wave}} of Armenian {{immigrants}} moved in the late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war {{who were able to}} make their way westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US, many with the help of George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Luis Muñoz Marín {{together}} with Governor Rexford Tugwell, the last non-Puerto Rican Governor of Puerto Rico appointed by an American president, helped advance legislation geared towards agricultural reform, economic recovery and industrialization. This program {{became known as}} Operation Bootstrap. As {{a result of the}} program, many Jews <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Ponce located in the southern region of the island and worked in the agricultural industry. Operation Bootstrap also attracted clothing manufactures from New York and many {{of the people in the}} industry who came to the island were Jews.|$|E
5|$|The graves {{made by the}} Iazyges {{were often}} {{rectangular}} or circular in shape. They were flat, and were grouped like a modern cemetery. During the time after the Iazyges <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tisza plain, and were in serious poverty. This {{is reflected in the}} poor furnishings of the burial sites, often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes brooches. Very rarely would there be iron daggers in the burial site, and even more rarely would there be iron swords. Their brooches and arm-rings were of the La Tène type, showing a distinct influence on the Iazyges by the Dacians.|$|E

5|$|The growing African-American {{population}} {{settling in}} the South Side bordered {{a neighborhood of}} Irish Americans existing since the mid-19th century and the two groups competed for jobs and housing. African-American migrants arrived after waves of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; there were competition and tensions in their relationships, too. Ethnic groups were possessive of their neighborhoods, which their young men often patrolled against outsiders. Because of agricultural problems, Southern whites also <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, about 20,000 by this period. The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding {{as a result of}} a lack of adequate low-cost housing.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} is present-day Oklahoma was first settled by prehistoric American Indians {{including}} the Clovis 11500 BCE, Folsom 10600 BCE and Plainview 10000 BCE cultures. Historic indigenous peoples who inhabited the region included the Wichita and Caddo peoples. In the 16th century, Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visited in 1541, beginning European contact. Around the 1700s, two tribes from the north, the Comanches and Kiowas, <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma and Texas region.|$|E
5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state and started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving {{a significant amount of}} land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E
50|$|After {{several years}} in {{freshwater}} habitats, the larvae undergo a metamorphosis that allows young post metamorphic lampreys <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea or lakes and start the hematophagous feeding.

5|$|A {{large body}} of Western Chalukya {{literature}} in Kannada language was produced {{during the reign of}} the Western Chalukya Empire (9731200 CE) in what is now southern India. This dynasty, which ruled most of the western Deccan in South India is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya Dynasty after its royal capital at Kalyani (now Basavakalyan) and sometimes called the Later Chalukya Dynasty for its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami. For a brief period (11621183), the Kalachuris of Kalyani, a dynasty of kings who had earlier <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Karnataka region from central India and served as vassals for several generations, exploited the growing weakness of their overlords and annexed the Kalyani. Around 1183, the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV, overthrew the Kalachuris to regain control of the royal city. But his efforts were in vain, as other prominent Chalukya vassals in the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas and the Seunas destroyed the remnants of the Chalukya power.|$|E
5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West; 3.454million left between 1950 and the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
