50|$|Due to its {{oxidative}} nature, {{sodium chlorate}} {{can be very}} toxic if ingested. The oxidative effect on hemoglobin leads to <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation, which is followed by denaturation of the globin protein and a cross-linking of erythrocyte membrane proteins with resultant damage to the membrane enzymes.

5000|$|Methemoglobin (English: <b>methaemoglobin)</b> (pronounced [...] "met-hemoglobin") {{is a form}} of the oxygen-carrying {{metalloprotein}} hemoglobin, {{in which}} the iron in the heme group is in the Fe3+ (ferric) state, not the Fe2+ (ferrous) of normal hemoglobin. Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, unlike oxyhemoglobin. It is bluish chocolate-brown in color. In human blood a trace amount of methemoglobin is normally produced spontaneously, but when present in excess the blood becomes abnormally dark bluish brown. The NADH-dependent enzyme methemoglobin reductase (diaphorase I) is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.|$|E

NO activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP activates protein kinase G which activates phosphatases which inactivate myosin light chains. Myosin light chains {{are involved in}} muscle contraction. The end result is vascular smooth muscle relaxation, which allow vessels to dilate.

Halobatrachus didactylus showed higher values of <b>methaemoglobin</b> reductase activity (38. 9 mmol NAD+/min/gHb) than Sparus aurata (27. 8 mmol NAD+/min/gHb). The reductase of Halobatrachus didactylus had, for both substrates, higher values of KM (potassium ferricyanide: 0. 133 mM, NADH: 0. 067 mM) and lower values of Vmax (potassium ferricyanide: 0. 097 min- 1; NADH: 0. 025 min- 1), than Sparus aurata (potassium ferricyanide: KM= 0. 092 mM, Vmax= 0. 176 min- 1, NADH: KM= 0. 032 mM, Vmax= 0. 062 min- 1).

40|$|Cadmium and two {{vanadate}} solutions as ‘metavanadate’ (containing ortho and metavanadate species) and ‘decavanadate’ (containing decameric species) (5 mM) were injected intraperitoneously in Halobatrachus didactylus (Lusitanian toadﬁsh), {{in order}} to evaluate the effects of cadmium and oligomeric vanadate species on <b>methaemoglobin</b> reductase activity from ﬁsh red blood cells. Following short-term exposure (1 and 7 days), different changes were observed on enzyme activity. After 7 days of exposure, ‘metavanadate’ increased <b>methaemoglobin</b> reductase activity by 67 % (P, 0. 05), whereas, minor effects were observed on enzymatic activity upon cadmium and ‘decavanadate’ administration. However, in vitro studies indicate that decameric vanadate, in concentrations as low as 50 mM, besides strongly inhibiting <b>methaemoglobin</b> reductase activity, promotes haemoglobin oxidation to <b>methaemoglobin.</b> Although decameric vanadate species showed to be unstable in the different media used in this work, the rate of decameric vanadate deoligomerization is in general slow enough, {{making it possible to}} study its effects. It is concluded that the increase in H. didactylus <b>methaemoglobin</b> reductase activity is more pronounced upon exposition to ‘metavanadate’ than to cadmium and decameric species.

40|$|The time {{course of}} <b>methaemoglobin</b> {{reduction}} in human erythrocytes treated with nitrite was studied at pH 7. 4, 37 degrees C, {{in the presence}} or absence of Methylene Blue, and the changes in <b>methaemoglobin,</b> intermediate haemoglobins and oxyhaemoglobin during the reaction were analysed by isoelectric-focusing on Ampholine/polyacrylamide-gel plates. In both cases, with or without the dye, the intermediate haemoglobins were found to be present at (alpha 3 +beta 2 +) 2 and (alpha 2 +beta 3 +) 2 valency hybrids from their characteristic position on electrophoresis, but amounts changed consecutively with time. The amount of (alpha 3 +beta 2 +) 2 was always greater than that of the (alpha 2 +beta 3 +) 2 valency hybrid.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{antioxidant}} lipoic acid and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), were studied {{on the process of}} the erythrocytic toxicity of 4 -aminophenol in human erythrocytes in vitro. 4 -Aminophenol alone caused a stepwise increase in <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation, along with a commensurate decrease in total thiols. At 10 min., in the presence of lipoic acid alone and the thiol depletor 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) alone, 4 -aminophenol-mediated <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation was significantly increased, whilst thiol levels were significantly reduced compared with the 4 -aminophenol alone. At 10 min., with DHLA and CDNB alone, 4 -aminophenol was associated with significantly increased <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation. However, thiol levels were not significantly different in the presence of DHLA compared with 4 -aminophenol alone, although thiol levels were different compared with control (4 -aminophenol alone) in the incubations with CDNB alone. At 15 min., only CDNB/ 4 -aminophenol <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation differed from control, whilst thiol levels were significantly lower in the presence of CDNB alone compared with 4 -aminophenol alone. Lipoic acid enhanced the toxicity of 4 -aminophenol in terms of increased <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation coupled with increased thiol depletion, whilst DHLA showed increased 4 -aminophenol-mediated <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation without thiol depletion.

40|$|Flying-foxes {{are better}} able to defend {{haemoglobin}} against autoxidation than non-volant mammals such as sheep. When challenged with the common physiological oxidant, hydrogen peroxide, haemolysates of flying-fox red blood cells (RBC) were far less susceptible to <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation than sheep. Challenge with 1 -acetyl- 2 -phenylhydrazine (APH) caused only half as much <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation in flying-fox as in ovine haemolysates. When intact cells were challenged with phenazine methosulfate (PMS), flying-fox RBC partially reversed the oxidant damage, and reduced <b>methaemoglobin</b> from 40 to 20 % over 2 h incubation, while ovine <b>methaemoglobin</b> remained at 40 %. This reflected flying-fox cells’ capacity to replenish GSH fast enough that it did not deplete beyond 50 %, while ovine RBC GSH was depleted to around 20 %. The greater capacity of flying-foxes to defend haemoglobin against oxidant damage may be explained in part by antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and cytochrome-b 5 reductase having two- to four-fold higher activity than in sheep (P < 0. 001). Further, their capacity to limit GSH depletion to 50 % and reduce <b>methaemoglobin</b> (in the presence of glucose), despite ongoing exposure to PMS may result from having ten-fold higher activity of G 6 PD and 6 PGD than sheep (P < 0. 001), indicating the presence of a very efficient pentose phosphate pathway in flying-foxes...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which haemoglobin and <b>methaemoglobin</b> inhibit the vasodilator actions of glyceryl trinitrate, sodium azide, nitric oxide, and the bovine retractor penis inhibitory factor (IF) were studied on rabbit endothelium-denuded aortic rings. <b>Methaemoglobin</b> was less effective than haemoglobin against each vasodilator, it was more effective at inhibiting the relaxation to azide than that to glyceryl trinitrate. Glyceryl trinitrate was neither bound nor inactivated when passed through columns of haemoglobin-agarose or methaemoglobin-agarose. Azide was reversibly bound but less by haemoglobin-agarose than by methaemoglobin-agarose. Inhibition of the vasodilator actions of glyceryl trinitrate is not attributable therefore to a direct interaction with the haemoproteins, although {{a small part of}} the inhibition of azide-induced relaxation by <b>methaemoglobin</b> is likely to be due to a direct interaction. Columns of haemoglobin-agarose were more effective than columns of methaemoglobin-agarose in removing nitric oxide from solution. The greater ability of haemoglobin, compared to <b>methaemoglobin,</b> to inhibit vasodilatation induced by nitrovasodilators may therefore reflect the greater ability of haemoglobin to bind nitric oxide which is the active principle of the nitrovasodilators. Neither the acid-activated nor the inactive forms of IF were bound or inactivated when passed through columns of methaemoglobin-agarose.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} show that the lungs {{infected}} with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often co-colonised by oral bacteria including black-pigmenting anaerobic (BPA) Porphyromonas species. The BPAs have an absolute haem requirement and their presence in the infected lung indicates that sufficient haem, a virulence up-regulator in BPAs, must be present to support growth. Haemoglobin from micro-bleeds occurring during infection is the most likely source of haem in the lung. Porphyromonas gingivalis displays a novel haem acquisition paradigm whereby haemoglobin must be firstly oxidised to <b>methaemoglobin,</b> facilitating haem release, either by gingipain proteolysis or capture via the haem-binding haemophore HmuY. P. aeruginosa produces the blue phenazine redox compound, pyocyanin. Since phenazines can oxidise haemoglobin, it follows that pyocyanin may also facilitate haem acquisition by promoting <b>methaemoglobin</b> production. Here we show that pyocyanin at concentrations found in the CF lung during P. aeruginosa infections rapidly oxidises oxyhaemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrate that <b>methaemoglobin</b> formed by pyocyanin is also susceptible to proteolysis by P. gingivalis Kgp gingipain and neutrophil elastase, thus releasing haem. Importantly, co-incubation of oxyhaemoglobin with pyocyanin facilitates haem pickup from the resulting methemoglobin by the P. gingivalis HmuY haemophore. Mice intra-tracheally challenged with viable P. gingivalis cells plus pyocyanin displayed increased mortality compared to those administered P. gingivalis alone. Pyocyanin significantly elevated both <b>methaemoglobin</b> and total haem levels in homogenates of mouse lungs and increased the level of arginine-specific gingipain activity from mice inoculated with viable P. gingivalis cells plus pyocyanin compared with mice inoculated with P. gingivalis only. These findings indicate that pyocyanin, by promoting haem availability through <b>methaemoglobin</b> formation and stimulating of gingipain production, may contribute to virulence of P. gingivalis and disease severity when co-infecting with P. aeruginosa in the lung...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methaemoglobin</b> {{is formed}} when the haem iron of deoxyhaemoglobin is {{oxidized}} from its ferrous (Fe 2 +) to the ferric state (Fe 3 +) {{resulting in a}} haemoglobin molecule that is structurally and functionally altered, which leads to tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Classifications of methaemoglobinemia are based on clinical history, causative agents, pattern of transmission and optical spectrum presentation of blood specimen and level of erythrocyte NADH-methaemoglobin reductase activity. Two major types of molecular/metabolic events leading to the presentation of methaemoglobinemia have been identified. The majority of the chemically induced-methaemoglobinemias are outcome {{of the presence of}} relatively high concentrations of oxidizing agents that overwhelm protective cellular reductive capacity of NADH-methaemoglobin reductase activity rather than inhibition of the enzyme. The control of physiologic levels of <b>methaemoglobin</b> is intricately intertwined with glucose metabolism for the supply of NADH and NADPH to provide electrons and protons for enzymatic reduction of <b>methaemoglobin</b> in concert with auxiliary antioxidant systems. The management and amelioration of methaemoglobinemia involves exchange transfusion and/or methylene blue administration...|$|E
