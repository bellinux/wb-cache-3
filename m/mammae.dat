5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of <b>mammae,</b> {{as usual in}} oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According to a study in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} chromosomal arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of <b>mammae,</b> one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six <b>mammae.</b> In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is a {{medium-sized}} rodent that looks {{much like the}} common black and brown rats, but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The fur is thick and short. The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown, with the head a bit lighter, and are sharply delimited from the underparts, which are off-white, as are the feet. It has small cheek pouches. The ears {{are about the same}} color as the upperparts, but a patch of light hairs is in front of them. The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below. The guard hairs are long and have unpigmented, silvery tips. When rice rats swim, air is trapped in the fur, which increases buoyancy and reduces heat loss. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight <b>mammae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{contains}} medium-sized, semiaquatically specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts {{and white}} to buff on the underparts. The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the introduced species black rat and brown rat, but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The vibrissae (whiskers) are short and the ears {{are small and}} well-haired. The tail is usually as long as or longer than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight <b>mammae,</b> as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities (squamae). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts. Interdigital webbing may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.|$|E
5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when pressed against the head. The short, rounded ears {{themselves}} are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of <b>mammae.</b> The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white hairs. Short ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the hallux) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.|$|E

5|$|When Voss and Carleton {{formally}} characterized Oryzomyini {{two years}} later, they did place Pseudoryzomys in the group, {{even though it}} lacks complete mesoloph(id)s. The mesoloph is an accessory crest on the upper molars and the mesolophid is the corresponding structure on the lower molars. Only a few other animals now considered oryzomyines lack complete mesoloph(id)s, but they are absent in various non-oryzomyines, some of which had previously been regarded as close relatives of the oryzomyines that lack them. Oryzomyines with and without complete mesoloph(id)s share various other characters, however, including presence of <b>mammae</b> on the chest, absence of a gall bladder, and some characters of the skull, suggesting that they form one natural, monophyletic group. Oryzomyini {{is now one of}} several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.|$|E
5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the <b>mammae</b> and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of <b>mammae</b> (six) {{are all the same}} in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E

25|$|The {{body length}} of O. nuttalli ranges from 50 to 115mm. The prehensile tail is from 50 to 97mm in length, {{generally}} {{the same length}} as {{the body of the}} mouse to which it belongs. Male golden mice have a baculum tipped with cartilage. Females have six <b>mammae.</b> Its whiskers {{on the face of the}} golden mouse are either black or grey. Golden mice receive their common name from the thick and soft golden fur that covers the upper body. However, the feet and undersides are white and its tail have a cream coloring. The cheek teeth of golden mice contain thick folds of enamel. As in other members of Muroidea, these mice have an infraorbital foramen with a distinct keyhole shape. Neither canines nor premolars are present. Incisors are sharp and long, separated from the cheek teeth by a diastema.|$|E

500|$|Neoromicia malagasyensis {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{vicinity}} of Isalo National Park, an area of about 2000km2 (800sq mi), in interior southwestern Madagascar. The holotype was caught in 1967 in a mistnet set {{in a row of}} palms along a river in dry savannah habitat. Peterson and colleagues reported that it had been collected near the village of Marinday, but Goodman and Ranivo suggested that it may instead have come from near Ilakaka. Two specimens, a male and a female, were collected at different localities in Isalo National Park in early December 2002, both in mistnets near rivers. The male had enlarged testes and the female had recently stopped lactating and had large <b>mammae.</b> Two others followed in 2003, also from the national park, and caught in woodland near rivers. A 2009 study on echolocation described the call of six individuals of N.malagasyensis from an unspecified site within the national park.
