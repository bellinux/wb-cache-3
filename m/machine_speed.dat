50|$|Data can be {{acquired}} from the specially designed {{hardware and software}} for the simulator. The purpose of this experiment should be to examine the spectra due to misalignment between the motor and the rotor shafts. Spectral comparisons should be made across coupling measurement points on left bearing housing and the motor. The data should be compared in both vertical and axial direction. If the results at 960 and 2100 RPM do not show significant vibration, the study can be limited to a higher speeds of 2900 and 3800 RPM. A correlation between misalignment and vibration signature could not be discerned. The data for all cases contained several harmonics. Both axial and lateral vibration was present in all cases. The dominant harmonic varied from condition to condition. As a general rule, as expected, increased misalignment yielded increased vibration peaks.As another general rule, peak vibrations in the misaligned machine were in the axial direction. For predictive maintenance applications where the goal is machinery health monitoring, it is sufficient {{to realize that the}} problem is complex. One can routinely trend the vibration spectra until it becomes severe. But for root cause analysis, one must exercise caution and perform a detailed analysis. Obviously, the rules provided in training courses and wall charts are doubtful at best.The observed changes that occurred with shifts of speed and misalignment do not show a typical signature for misalignment vibration spectra. Hence, it can be concluded that misalignment vibration is a strong function of <b>machine</b> <b>speed</b> and coupling stiffness. A single point vibration spectrum does not provide good and reliable indication of machinery misalignment. Observations of spectra in axial and radial directions at various speeds and several points are needed to diagnose misalignment effects. Orbital plots of vertical and horizontal measurements in the time domain might also be needed. Non-linear dynamic modelling must be performed to gain full understanding of misalignment effects. Finally, more work in this field is simply needed in order to develop simple rules for diagnosing machinery shaft misalignment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn-line {{estimation}} of workpiece height {{is essential for}} wire breaking prevention in WEDM process. In addition, it can provide the reference of machining parameters setting for increasing <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> and stability. A new on-line WEDM workpiece height estimation system for the iso-energy type wire EDM machine is presented. Based on the proposed specific discharge energy (SDE), a mathematical model relating workpiece height, feed rate and discharging frequency by a proportional constant is derived. This constant coined thickness identification coefficient (TIC) is found a function of workpiece height. Hence, a simplified approach is proposed. The value of TIC of a known workpiece height is taken to estimate the workpiece height during the WEDM process. The actual workpiece height is obtained by multiplying the estimated value by the correction factor of the associated workpiece height. Experimental {{results show that the}} system works satisfactorily. The estimation error of workpiece height is within 1 mm while the response time is less than 1 second in general. In the practical application of machining a workpiece with dynamic variations in thickness, a model relating optimum servo voltage and workpiece height that leads to maximum <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> is established in advance.
