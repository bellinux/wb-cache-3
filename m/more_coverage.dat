5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E

However, immigrants, labor, and political organizations earned <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> {{than most other}} groups. The preoccupation with Irish nationalists in the 1860s and 1870s saw expanded networks which peaked with a combined total of approximately 60 agents and operatives, and {{on more than one}} occasion these agents slipped south of the Canada–US border to infiltrate US branches of the Fenian movement in cities such as New York, Buffalo, Chicago, and Kansas City.|$|E

Originally a {{developer}} and publisher of online games, in 2001 WarCry acquired the assets of Crossroads Gaming Network (also known as XRGaming) in an undisclosed private transaction. The merged company took the WarCry name as WarCry Corp., but dropped the online gaming angle to concentrate on <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> of games, particularly massively multiplayer which had been XRGaming's stock in trade. Whilst popular, XRGaming had been suffering {{in the midst of}} the dot-com bust and WarCry's funding enabled both to survive.|$|E

25|$|Broadcasting in France {{was largely}} a state {{monopoly}} until 1982, when the socialist president François Mitterrand allowed private broadcasters and privatised the leading television channel. Competition between channels raised the broadcasting fees paid to the organisers from 1.5 per cent of the race budget in 1960 {{to more than a}} third {{by the end of the}} century. Broadcasting time also increased as channels competed to secure the rights. The two largest channels to stay in public ownership, Antenne 2 and FR3, combined to offer <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> than its private rival, TF1. The two stations, renamed France 2 and France 3, still hold the domestic rights and provide pictures for broadcasters around the world.|$|E
25|$|By 1926, the {{eleventh}} edition {{was beginning to}} show its age, and work on a new edition was begun. The editors were J. L. Garvin in London and Franklin Henry Hooper in New York. It has 24 volumes, reduced from 29 in the 11th edition, yet has 45,000 articles compared to 37,000. It has 15,000 illustrations, of which 1,500 are full plates. The 14th edition took three years to complete, at the then exorbitant cost of $2.5 million, all of it invested by Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck and Company. It {{was very different from}} the 11th edition, having fewer volumes and simpler articles, continuing the business strategy of popularizing the Britannica for the American mass market at the expense of its scholarship. The 14th edition also drew criticism for deleting information unflattering to the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the 14th also included many illustrious contributors, including eighteen Nobel laureates in science, such as Robert Millikan, Albert Abraham Michelson and Arthur Compton. <b>More</b> <b>coverage</b> was given to popular entertainment, with Gene Tunney writing on boxing, Lillian Gish on acting and Irene Castle on ballroom dancing. George Bernard Shaw contributed a well-regarded article on socialism. In all, there were roughly 3500 named contributors, of which roughly half were American. The 14th edition was again criticized for sexism, by a woman who wrote to editor Walter Yust that too many biographies were of men; Yust made a count and found that 6% of its 13,000 biographies were of women.|$|E

500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little <b>more</b> <b>coverage,</b> if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E

[...] On his blog, [...] "The Rest Is Noise", Ross called the Symphony's performance [...] "extraordinary", {{one of the}} [...] "most gripping events of the current season". In his two-page review of Spring for Music for The New Yorker, Ross devoted <b>more</b> <b>coverage</b> to the Oregon Symphony than the other featured ensembles and considered Music for a Time of War the festival's highpoint. He complimented the orchestra for playing with [...] "controlled intensity" [...] and said of Symphony No. 4: [...] "The Oregonians' furious rendition of that symphony would have been impressive in any context, but as the capstone to a brilliantly worked-out program it had shattering force." [...] The review contained an illustration of Kalmar, [...] "hair flying and all". Sedgwick Clark of Musical America called the orchestra's performance of the Williams piece [...] "positively searing... with fearless edge-of-seat tempos... breathtakingly negotiated by all." [...] After Clark's review was published, Ross posted on his blog that he and Clark concurred: the Symphony's performance was the most [...] "remarkable" [...] of the season. Ross included the Symphony's concert on his list {{of the most memorable}} classical performances of 2011. Allan Kozinn, music critic for The New York Times, considered the program [...] "pained" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking", and wrote that Sylvan performed with his [...] "characteristic acuity". He called the woodwind and brass playing in Sinfonia da Requiem [...] "superb", specifically highlighting the [...] "pointed" [...] percussion in [...] "Dies Irae" [...] and the [...] "haunting" [...] string tone in [...] "Requiem Aeternam". Like Ross, Kozinn thought Symphony No. 4 was performed [...] "with a furious, incendiary energy" [...] that made an ideal ending to the program.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{government}} subsidies for insurance premiums essentially {{depend on the}} response of the public to this form of intervention. Generally, premium subsidies will encourage more people to participate in an insurance program, and therefore <b>more</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> and protection is provided by the private sector (Glauber 2004). <b>More</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> purchased means that more losses can be indemnified by insurance (the “insured loss”), and therefore more risks are transferred. Therefore, the expected value of the extra insured loss {{can be used as a}} measure of the effect achieved.|$|R
