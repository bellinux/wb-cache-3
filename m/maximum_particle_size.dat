The sizes are modeled down to reduce the sizes for testing in the laboratory. The shear strength parameters are very much dependent on <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> and angularity, surface texture, grading, shape. Unconfined void content (UVC) represents angularity, surface texture, grading and shape for fine aggregates. The same concept has been used for rockfill materials by testing for UVC. The UVC have been determined for alluvial and quarried rockfill materials. For each material, three modeled grain size distribution curves (for 19 mm, 9. 5 mm & 4. 75 mm) are obtained for testing them in the laboratory for UVC.

50|$|Freely {{available}} SAS analysis {{computer programs}} have been intensively developed at EMBL. In the first general ab initio approach, an angular envelope function of the particle r=F(ω), where (r,ω) are spherical coordinates, is described {{by a series of}} spherical harmonics. The low resolution shape is thus defined by a few parameters - the coefficients of this series - which fit the scattering data. The approach was further developed and implemented in the computer program SASHA (Small Angle Scattering Shape Determination). It was demonstrated that under certain circumstances a unique envelope can be extracted from the scattering data. This method is only applicable to globular particles with relatively simple shapes and without significant internal cavities. To overcome these limitations, there was another approach developed, which uses different types of Monte-Carlo searches. DALAI_GA is an elegant program, which takes a sphere with diameter equal to the <b>maximum</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> Dmax, which is determined from the scattering data, and fills it with beads. Each bead belongs either to the particle (index=1) or to the solvent (index=0). The shape is thus described by the binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, a genetic algorithm searches for a model that fits the data. Compactness and connectivity constrains are imposed in the search, implemented in the program DAMMIN. If the particle symmetry is known, SASHA and DAMMIN can utilise it as useful constraints. The 'give-n-take' procedure SAXS3D and the program SASMODEL, based on interconnected ellipsoids are ab initio Monte Carlo approaches without limitation in the search space.|$|E

40|$|Mudrocks are {{indurated}} sediments widely encountered {{throughout the}} world, {{often associated with}} opencast mining activities where they are used as backfill. Opencast coal mines are frequently reinstated with substantial depths of fill to provide land for development. However, mudstones tend to change from a brittle crushable nature to a ductile clay material when inundated, causing major settlement problems when used as a fill. Three distinguishable settlement stages exist; primary compression due to immediate placement of the fill, relatively short-term but often very large strain collapse due to inundation and finally long-term creep and consolidation (Reed & Singh, 1986; Hills & Denby, 1996 and Goodwin et al., 2003). To provide a tool for engineers to predict primary and collapse settlements for large areas of mudrock fill, Rowe consolidation cell tests were conducted to analyse the influence of initial moisture content, initial <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution and stress on the collapse settlement and weathering of mudrock. Triaxial isotropic tests were also conducted to investigate the stress-strain characteristics of mudrock under three states: dry, short-term inundated, and long-term. The developed predictive model was then compared with a previous model for mudrock collapse developed by Blanchfield (2000). The Rowe consolidation test results show small changes in void ratio for loading under dry conditions but drastic collapse when inundated at the same stress level. The large strains {{are believed to be}} due to the wetting of the outer part of the particles acting as a lubricant, causing the wetted particles to slide past one another allowing the soil to collapse. Under all three different soil states, {{it can be seen that}} well graded samples show less settlement compared to uniform graded samples. Results of triaxial tests show that well graded specimens always demonstrated the highest maximum deviator stress at failure regardless of the soil states of the specimens. This was followed by uniformly graded specimens with smaller <b>maximum</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> and finally the uniformly graded specimens with larger <b>maximum</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes.</b> Higher <b>maximum</b> deviator stress at failure means higher load is required in order to fail the soil specimens. This trend is consistent with findings of one-dimensional compression tests· where well graded specimens always exhibited the least settlement in all soil conditions [...] It is observed, however, that the values of the maximum deviator stress appeared to decrease as the soil states changed from dry to wetted to degraded conditions. Furthermore, the dry mudrock is seen to exhibit high curved Mohr-Coulomb failure envelopes with the angle of shearing resistance values decreasing with increasing confining stress. The angle of shearing resistance decreasing from 41. 20 to 31. 30 as the mean effective stress increased from 200 to 700 kPa. This trend is consistent with findings reported by Yasufuku and Hyde (1995) who investigated pile end-bearing capacity in crushable sands. This behaviour which normally exhibited by crushable soil indicated that dry mudrock is crushable and higher effective stress application had caused more crushing to dry mudrock. Results of both Rowe consolidation tests and triaxial isotropic test suggest that the settlement behaviour of mudrock is largely affected by initial moisture content, <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution and soil states.

40|$|Previous {{models of}} the {{equilibrium}} temperature and existence regions of mesospheric aerosols have shown significant radiative heating of the aerosols and, consequently, a substantially reduced existence region. We have developed an iterative model that extends this previous work by incorporating a complete collisional energy transfer algorithm, including the effects of vertical winds and particle fall velocity, that is appropriate for the free molecular flow conditions found in the mesosphere. We have also updated the ice refractive index used in the model and accounted for the dependence of the radiative heating and collisional cooling terms on particle tempe;ature. Finally, a radiation model {{has been used to}} calculate the solar, terrestrial and atmospheric radiative inputs including the effects of multiple scattering and atmospheric absorption. As with the previous models, the particle temperature is calculated under steady-state conditions, assuming the background gas temperature remains constant and the aerosol does not change size, state or altitude. Under these conditions, the largest differences from previous models occur {{as a result of the}} updated ice index of refraction, particularly in the visible, which produces significantly less aerosol heating. These temperatures are combined with the observed properties of mesospheric aerosols to place limits on the water vapour mixing ratio, vertical-wind speeds, and <b>maximum</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes.</b> It is found that H 2 O mixing ratios of 10 ppmv and vertical winds of order 0. 02 m s(- 1) are consistent with observed particle distributions, and these lead to a radiative limit on the <b>maximum</b> <b>particle</b> radius of 250 nm...|$|R
