25|$|In 1961, Vic Greenhouse, {{head of the}} art {{department}} at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) invited King to join the group of printmakers, which included Fred Williams and Hertha Kluge-Pott, who were allowed to use its printing facilities on one day per week. The following year (1962), RMIT bought a lithography press. King {{was one of the}} few able to use it. From then on King concentrated on producing lithographs and creative monotypes. In 1965, he acquired a small off-set litho press (12 ins x 15 ins or about 30.5 x 38.1cm) for his studio at Warrandyte. Although this press was “a bit on the small side”, by designing for its limitations King could <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> prints. Some years later, he acquired a larger press which “gave him scope to wield a longer, wider brush-mark on the lithographic plate”.|$|E
25|$|The budget {{proposed}} requiring {{state workers}} to <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> contributions toward {{the cost of}} the health insurance they received as an employee benefit. An attempt to persuade the legislature to relax state rules to allow for the outsourcing of state services to private contractors was rebuffed. However, Romney was more successful with efforts to reorganize and consolidate some of the agencies of the state executive branch (such as Health & Human Services), trimming the ranks of state government workers by 2,000 to 3,000 workers with the 2004 budget. Another example of his government restructuring efforts was his plan to reduce state expenditures on legal proceedings by revamping the court system, cutting the numbers of state-employed attorneys, and refusing to increase state payments to attorneys who accepted cases of defendants too poor to afford private attorneys (Massachusetts' court-appointed attorneys were being paid some of the lowest hourly rates in the nation). Romney vetoed a funding bill for payment of attorneys representing the poor, declaring that it was more important for the state to balance its books than to pay attorneys, and that the attorneys should provide the services pro bono. The cuts in payments for representation of the indigent provoked outraged attorneys to strike. The plan to remake the court system was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Oryzomys couesi {{lives on}} the ground and is semiaquatic, {{spending}} much time in the water, as Alston in his original description already recognized, but is also a good climber. A study in Costa Rica found that O.couesi is an excellent swimmer, diving well and using its tail to propel itself. It is probably able to forage underwater, which may help differentiate its niche from that of the ecologically similar cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, which also swims well, but does not dive. When disturbed, O.couesi will enter the water and swim away. It is primarily active during the night. Oryzomys couesi builds globular nests of woven vegetation suspended among reeds, about [...] above the water or the ground; in Texas, larger individuals <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> nests. It does not usually make its own runways in vegetation, but may use those of other rodents, such as cotton rats.|$|E

500|$|The opera was {{the first}} by Gluck showing signs of his {{ambition}} to reform opera seria. Self-contained arias and choruses make way for shorter pieces strung together to <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> structural units. Da capo arias are notable by their absence; Gluck instead uses strophic form, notably in act one's [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così", where each verse is interposed with dramatic recitative, – that is, stromentato, where the voice is accompanied by part {{or all of the}} orchestra – and rondo form, such as in act three's famous [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?". Also absent is traditional secco recitative, where the voice is accompanied only by the basso continuo. On the whole, old Italian operatic conventions are disregarded in favour of giving the action dramatic impetus. The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots. Gluck was influenced by the example of French tragédies en musique, particularly those of Rameau. Like them, the opera contains a large number of expressive dances, extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative. The coup de théâtre of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau's Castor et Pollux (1737). Other elements do not follow Gluck's subsequent reforms; for instance, the brisk, cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come. The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor, so that the strophic [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così" [...] does not become dull, and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?", both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature. The first Orfeo, Gaetano Guadagni, was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the renowned Shakespearian actor David Garrick. Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without raising his voice. Indeed, Gluck faced criticism of [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?" [...] {{on the grounds that it}} was emotionally uninvolved; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria: [...] "make the slightest change, either in the movement or in the turn of expression, and it will become a saltarello for marionettes".|$|E

2500|$|In the {{resonating}} {{valence bond}} theory, {{the factors that}} determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability {{is associated with the}} simplest ratios or [...] "bond numbers": , , , , , etc. The choice of structure and the value of the axial ratio (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{different}} fibers are twisted, knotted and {{woven into}} textiles and objects. [...] Materials include rushes, reeds, thread, plastic string and rope {{as well as}} many more. Historically, fibers were dyed using pigments created from plants and animals. Synthetic dyes have replaced natural ones for many craftspeople, but there still are some, especially in Oaxaca state that still use traditional dyes. Woven materials in Mexico started with basketry and mat-making. The agave plant was an important source of fibers and thread and is still used to day for thread and paper. Cotton was also used, spun into thread by itself or combined with feathers or animal fur to provide warmth. Very traditional Mexican women still spin their own thread, which are made from cotton or wool and can be very fine or very coarse. Textiles have long history of tradition. Brightly colored embroidered designs on female garments can identify tribe, age, and marital status of the wearer. [...] Woven textiles were known to pre-Hispanic cultures for hundreds of years before the arrival of the Spanish, using a back-strap loom fastened between a tree and the weaver’s back. The Spanish introduced the treadle loom, which can <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> pieces of cloth.|$|E
