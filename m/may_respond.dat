5|$|Prolactinomas <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that {{mimics the}} action of dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make supplementary treatment unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively, with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests. If there is any deterioration, or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur, surgical intervention may still be indicated. If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to dopamine agonist treatment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral genetic {{studies have}} {{identified}} potential genetic and non-genetic contributors to psychopathy, including influences on brain function. Proponents of the triarchic model believe that psychopathy {{results from the}} interaction of genetic predispositions and an adverse environment. What is adverse may differ depending on the underlying predisposition: for example, it is hypothesized that persons having high boldness <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> poorly to punishment but <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> better to rewards and secure attachments.|$|E

Targets latch the address and begin decoding it. They <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> with DEVSEL# in time for clock 2 (fast DEVSEL), 3 (medium) or 4 (slow).

Miliband was elected on 5 May 2005, with 55.5% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 12,656. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 23 <b>May,</b> <b>responding</b> to comments made by future Speaker John Bercow.

50|$|In late <b>May,</b> <b>responding</b> to {{the threat}} from {{constant}} Apache raids, Colonel Bonneville organized a two-pronged expedition into Apacheria. Hundreds of troops assembled at Fort Fillmore and Albuquerque. Colonel William W. Loring commanded the northern column, which left from Albuquerque for the Mogollon Mountains, while Miles commanded the southern column, which would advance west along the Gila. Bonneville accompanied the southern column but Miles was in command. Altogether about 800 infantry, cavalry and Pueblo scouts were involved, 600 of whom were part of Bonneville's column.|$|R
25|$|The myriad {{causes of}} {{intrinsic}} AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.|$|E

In the eighth inning, after a close pitch, Cobb threw his bat in Mays' direction, calling him a [...] "no good son of a bitch." [...] <b>Mays</b> <b>responded</b> by calling Cobb a [...] "yellow dog." [...] After order was restored, Mays hit Cobb directly on the wrist. The Tigers won the game 6-1 and the incident cemented Mays' reputation as a head hunter.|$|R
25|$|Subtype {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulators preferentially bind {{to either}} the α- or the β-subtype of the receptor. In addition, the different estrogen receptor combinations <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> differently to various ligands, which may translate into tissue selective agonistic and antagonistic effects. The ratio of α- to β- subtype concentration has been proposed {{to play a role}} in certain diseases.|$|E
25|$|Suspension bridges <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to {{earthquakes}} with a side-to-side motion exceeding {{that which}} was designed for wind gust response. Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road surface, damage to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components. Devices such as hydraulic dampers or clamped sliding connections and additional diagonal reenforcement may be added.|$|E

25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole). Although hypomanic episodes <b>may</b> <b>respond</b> to a mood stabilizer alone, full-blown episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} mood stabilizer, as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E
25|$|Pain is severe, {{frequently}} out {{of proportion}} to physical signs, and often requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels.

Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.|$|E
