40|$|Neuropathy target {{esterase}} {{has been}} shown to be a lysophospholipase in mouse. The authors investigate the effect of neuropathy target esterase inhibition in mouse nervous tissues in vitro on the homeostasis of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine by treating the homogenates with tri-ortho-cresyl phos-phate, paraoxon, paraoxon plus <b>mipafox,</b> and phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride. The activity of neuropathy target esterase is significantly inhibited by phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride and paraoxon plus <b>mipafox</b> but not by paraoxon alone. Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate slightly but significantly inhibits neuropathy target esterase activity in brain. The levels of phosphatidyl-choline and lysophosphatidylcholine in all 3 nervous tissues are not obviously altered after treatment with tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate, paraoxon, or paraoxon plus <b>mipafox.</b> However, phosphatidylcholine and lysophos-phatidylcholine levels are clearly enhanced by phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride. It is concluded that inhibition of neuropathy target esterase in mouse nervous tissues is not enough to disrupt the homeostasis of phosphati-dylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine and that the upregulation by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride may be the consequence of combined inhibition of neuropathy target esterase and other phospholipases...|$|E
40|$|Neostigmine (2. 2 μg/ml.) or {{physostigmine}} (3. 3 μg/ml.) contracted guinea-pig isolated tracheal chains.

Local anaesthetics, cooling, ionic changes and hemicholinium, all known to inhibit {{the release of}} acetylcholine from nerve endings, abolished or much reduced the responses.

40|$|A {{circular}} and {{a longitudinal}} muscle strip were prepared from adjacent {{parts of a}} guinea-pig ileum and a direct pharmacological comparison made under identical conditions. The longitudinal preparation was sensitive to acetylcholine, methacholine, carbachol, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, histamine and nicotine, while the circular preparation was insensitive to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, histamine and nicotine, and responded to the choline esters only in high concentrations. Incubation of the preparations with the anticholinesterase, <b>mipafox</b> (NN-diisopropylphosphodiamidic fluoride), sensitized both preparations to the action of acetylcholine; potentiation of the contraction of the longitudinal muscle was 16 -times; that of the circular one 4, 000 -times. The longitudinal muscle was more sensitive than the circular muscle to acetylcholine whether both were treated with <b>mipafox</b> or not. Bradykinin and substance P both stimulated the longitudinal but not the circular muscle, an effect not modified after <b>mipafox.</b> Hyoscine antagonized {{the responses of the}} circular muscle strip, treated with <b>mipafox,</b> to acetylcholine and to histamine, but on the longitudinal muscle strip the response to histamine was not affected, the response to acetylcholine being competitively antagonized. Morphine, in the same concentrations on both circular and longitudinal muscle strips, antagonized the stimulant actions of nicotine {{and to a lesser extent}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine, but the responses to histamine on the longitudinal muscle strip were not antagonized by morphine which was in contrast to its action on the circular muscle strip. These observations showed that the main differences in the responses of the circular and longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig ileum to drugs were in the intrinsic properties of the smooth muscle cells. In addition cholinesterase may protect the circular muscle cells. Finally the circular muscle strip preparation proved to be a useful tool to study the action of drugs on the nervous plexuses of the ileum of the guinea-pig...|$|E
40|$|Historically, only few {{chemicals}} {{have been}} identified as neurodevelopmental toxicants, however, concern remains, and has recently increased, based upon the association between chemical exposures and increased developmental disorders. Diminution in motor speed and latency has been reported in preschool children from agricultural communities. Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are pesticides due to their acute insecticidal effects mediated by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, although other esterases as neuropathy target esterase (NTE) can also be inhibited. Other neurological and neurodevelopmental toxic effects with unknown targets have been reported after chronic exposure to OPs in vivo. We studied the initial stages of retinoic acid acid-triggered differentiation of pluripotent cells towards neural progenitors derived from human embryonal carcinoma stem cells to determine if neuropathic OP, <b>mipafox,</b> and non-neuropathic OP, paraoxon, are able to alter differentiation of neural precursor cells in vitro. Exposure to 1 µM paraoxon (non-cytotoxic concentrations) altered the expression of different genes involved in signaling pathways related to chromatin assembly and nucleosome integrity. Conversely, exposure to 5 µM <b>mipafox,</b> a known inhibitor of NTE activity, showed no significant changes on gene expression. We conclude that 1 µM paraoxon could affect the initial stage of in vitro neurodifferentiation possibly due to a teratogenic effect, while the absence of transcriptional alterations by <b>mipafox</b> exposure did not allow us to conclude a possible effect on neurodifferentiation pathways at the tested concentration...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study was conducted to develop cell culture based systems to test the efficacy of enzyme prophylaxsis for the detoxification of organophosphorus (OP) neurotoxicants. The assays utilized for detecting OP neurotoxicity and its amelioration by organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) were-. 1) inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), 2) inhibition of neurotoxic esterase (NTE), and 3) alterations in ionophore-induced Ca 21 fluxes in transformed neuronal cell lines SY 5 Y (human neuroblastoma) and PC 12 (rat pheochromocytoma). It was observed that OPH suppressed the ability of paraoxon to inhibit ACHE, restoring activity from 33 % to lOO% in PC 12 cells and from 2 % to 86 % in SY 5 Y cells. OPH did not suppress NTE inhibition by <b>mipafox</b> within 5 minutes (59. 5 % inhibition by <b>mipafox</b> and 56. 5 % by hydrolyzed <b>mipafox)</b> suggesting that <b>mipafox</b> hydrolysis proceeds at a slow rate. Microfluoroscopy with the fluorescent calcium probe fluo- 3 suggested that, contrary to expectations based on effects of other OP compounds, paraoxon had no effect of Ca'+ fluxes in cells exposed to ionomycin. Cells treated with hydrolyzed paraoxon showed a higher final fluorescence level after recovery from ionomycin (1 195 fluorescence units) than cells treated with paraoxon (874 fluorescence units), p-nitrophenol (951 fluorescence units) and OPH alone (871 fluorescence units) suggesting a potential role for paraoxon breakdown product diethyl phosphonic acid. Also cells treated with hydrolyzed paraoxon and p-nitrophenol showed significantly different recovery rates. The {{results of this study suggest}} that though enzymatic detoxification of OPs may selectively attenuate inhibition of enzyme systems, such detoxification may augment effects on [Ca 2 +] i due to the production of organic phosphonic acids. Thus a battery of assays addressing different aspects of OP toxicity is indicated for validating enzymatic detoxification of OPs...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathy target {{esterase}} (NTE) is a membrane-bound carboxylesterase {{activity that}} has been proposed as the target site for initiation of organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy. This activity is identified by its resistance to treatment with Paraoxon and sensitivity to co-incubation with Paraoxon and <b>Mipafox.</b> Sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation of membrane-associated proteins isolated from chick-embryo brains identified three proteins, Mr 161, 000, 116, 500 and 103, 000, that were labelled with [3 H]di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate in an NTE-like manner and that co-migrated with NTE. The 161, 000 -Mr and 116, 500 -Mr proteins were identified in both adult and embryo brain. One or both of these proteins may therefore contribute to the activity defined as NTE. In addition, a 61, 000 -Mr protein was identified that does not comigrate with NTE, but that was labelled with [3 H]di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate in a Paraoxon-resistant and Mipafox-sensitive manner. The effect of <b>Mipafox</b> on labelling, however, was reversibly blocked by co-incubation with Paraoxon. This protein, therefore, is not NTE, but has the necessary inhibitor-sensitivity to be the target site for organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{assessing}} the neurotoxic potential of organophosphorus compounds, it has been determined that paraoxon-preinhibited hen brain has both neurotoxicant (<b>mipafox)</b> -sensitive (neurotoxic esterase; NTE) and -insensitive esterase components. Several experiments designed to investigate the kinetic parameters governing the reaction of these esterases with two substrates and one organophosphorus inhibitor are presented. First, kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of phenyl valerate and phenyl phenylacetate were measured. At 37 degrees C, the Km values of NTE for phenyl valerate and phenyl phenylacetate {{were found to be}} about 1. 4 X 10 (- 3) and 1. 6 X 10 (- 4) M respectively. At 25 degrees C, the Km of NTE for phenyl valerate was determined to be about 2. 4 X 10 (- 3) M. Secondly, the kinetic constants of NTE for <b>mipafox</b> were measured at both 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. With either phenyl valerate or phenyl phenylacetate as substrate, the Km at 37 degrees C was determined to be about 1. 8 X 10 (- 4) M, and the phosphorylation constant (k 2) was about 1. 1 min- 1. For phenyl valerate only, the Km at 25 degrees C was found to be about 6 X 10 (- 4) M, and the k 2 was about 0. 7 min- 1. The data obtained at 25 degrees C were analysed by using a two-component model without formation of Michaelis complex, a two-component model with formation of Michaelis complex on the second component (NTE), or a three-component model without formation of Michaelis complex. The fact that the Michaelis model fit the data significantly better than either of the other two models indicates that the higher apparent Ki values that occur with low concentrations of <b>mipafox</b> are due to formation of Michaelis complex at high concentrations, rather than {{because of the presence of}} two NTE isoenzymes, as has been suggested by other investigators...|$|E
40|$|A {{preparation}} of the guinea-pig isolated intact trachea is described which allows transmural stimulation of the intrinsic nerves of the tracheal muscle with simultaneous measurement of the volume changes of the trachea caused by contraction or relaxation of the tracheal muscle. The apparatus allows fluid {{to be removed from}} the lumen and outside of the trachea for assay of acetylcholine. The response to transmural stimulation over a range of 1 to 50 shocks/sec is first a contraction followed by a relaxation. The contraction is best seen at high frequencies of stimulation and is abolished by atropine. The contraction is enhanced by treatment of the trachea with the anticholinesterase NN-diisopropylphosphodiamidic fluoride (<b>mipafox),</b> and is thus probably due to stimulation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves. The relaxation is maximal at low frequencies of stimulation. After treatment with <b>mipafox</b> a substance resembling acetylcholine is released in the absence of stimulation. The acetylcholine output rises following transmural stimulation, probably due to release of acetylcholine from cholinergic motor nerves. No relationship between frequency of transmural stimulation and release of acetylcholine has been seen in nine of ten experiments. The resting and stimulated release of acetylcholine is not greatly reduced by attempted separation of the tracheal muscle from the bulk of the trachea. This result suggests that acetylcholine outputs from the intact trachea are a measure of release from the smaller tracheal muscle...|$|E
40|$|Neurotoxic {{esterase}} (NTE) is a membrane-bound protein {{found in}} highest concentration in brain and lymphocytes. The enzyme has no known physiological function, but its organophosphorylation and aging in neural tissue {{are thought to}} trigger the pathogenesis of organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). Solubilization of NTE from microsomal membranes from hen or chick brain was studied with ten detergents encompassing ionic, zwitterionic, or nonionic types. Corrected yields of NTE solubilized over a range of [detergent]/[protein] ratios were determined by dividing the activity not sedimenting in detergent at 100, 000 g for 60 min at 4 [deg] by the activity in the original microsomal fraction with no detergent present. Highest corrected yields were obtained with sodium cholate (44 %), Triton X- 100 (48 %), and nonyl-GPS (57 %). Partial loss of NTE activity occurred {{in the presence of}} detergent which could be prevented by the inclusion of asolectin in the solubilization preparation. NTE could not be solubilized by omitting detergent or by substituting 2 M NaCl for detergent. <b>Mipafox</b> pI 50 values obtained from complete titration curves carried out on NTE solubilized in Triton X- 100, sodium cholate, or sodium cholate/asolectin were indistinguishable from the value for native enzyme from brain homogenate. These results indicate that NTE exhibits the properties of an integral membrane protein with lipid dependence. The enzyme can be solubilized in good yield with a variety of detergents with retention of its characteristic differential inhibition by paraoxon and <b>mipafox,</b> a necessary prelude to bulk purification of the enzymatically active protein...|$|E
40|$|Hen {{brain and}} spinal cord contain {{a number of}} esterases that hydrolyze phenyl {{valerate}} (PV). Most of this activity is sensitive to inhibition by micromolar concentrations of paraoxon. Included among the paraoxon-resistant esterases is neurotoxic esterase (NTE), which is inhibited in vivo and in vitro by certain organophosphorus compounds, such as <b>mipafox,</b> which cause delayed neurotoxicity. Since published information on the NTE content of non-neural tissues was heretofore lacking, a comprehensive study was undertaken of the occurrence of this enzyme in tissues of the adult hen (Gallus gallus domesticus), the species of choice {{in the study of}} organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity. Complete differential titration curves of PV esterase activity were obtained by preincubation of each tissue homogenate {{with a wide range of}} concentrations of paraoxon, a non-neurotoxic compound, plus or minus <b>mipafox,</b> a neurotoxic compound, followed by PV esterase assay. Brain NTE activity was determined to be 2426 +/- 104 nmoles [middle dot] min- 1 [middle dot] (g wet weight) - 1 (mean +/- S. E. M.). Titration of other tissues resulted in the following NTE activities, expressed as percentages of brain NTE activity: spinal cord (21 %), peripheral nerve (1. 7 %), gastrocnemius muscle (0 %), pectoralis muscle (0 %), heart (14 %), liver (0 %), kidney (0 %), spleen (70 %), spleen lymphocytes (26 %), and blood lymphocytes (24 %). Using an abbreviated procedure, erythrocytes and plasma showed no NTE activity.

Manometric studies showed that all four compounds were highly active, however, in inhibiting the cholinesterase found in the chick amnion.

Gel column chromatography indicated that the DFPase in both tissues is {{in the range of}} 82, 100 to 93, 300 D. This activity is strongly inhibited by N,N'-diisopropylphosphorodia-midofluoridate (<b>mipafox).</b> The chicken has organophosphate acid (OPA) anhydrase activity comparable to other eucaryotic sources in its ability to hydrolyze DFP.

40|$|Organophosphorus {{compounds}} (OPs) are pesticides {{of worldwide}} use {{due to the}} acute insecticidal effects mediated by the inhibition of esterases of {{the central nervous system}} (mainly acetylcholinesterase and neuropathy target esterase (NTE)). OPs need to inhibit acetylcholinesterase to be effective insecticides, but not NTE since its inhibition might cause progressive, irreversible delayed neuropathy in humans and other species. Additionally, other neurological and neurodevelopmental toxic effects with unknown targets have been reported in humans or animals chronically exposed to OPs. We used a mixed neuronal/glia culture derived from well-characterised human embryonal carcinoma stem cells (hNT 2) to determine if neuropathic OP <b>mipafox</b> and non-neuropathic OP paraoxon are able to alter the neuronal differentiation process evaluated by gene expression studies, neuronal electrical activity measurements and neural cell morphology quantification. Exposure to paraoxon at non-cytotoxic concentrations altered the expression of different genes involved mainly in signalling pathways related to chromatin assembly and nucleosome integrity, generating cultures with a larger number of differentiated neurons-like cells and branching points than in the control. Moreover, these paraoxon-exposed neuronal-like cells displayed reduced electrical activity when compared with the control neurons as measured by Micro Electrode Array Chips. Similarly, exposure to <b>mipafox,</b> a known inhibitor of NTE activity, also reduced the electrical activity of hNT 2 cultures differentiated into neurons-like cells, but no significant changes in cell morphology or gene expression were detected. Therefore, we conclude that paraoxon is able to strongly disturb in vitro neurodifferentiation, while the absence of morphological and transcriptional alterations did not allow us to conclude if the electrophysiological alterations detected in mipafox-exposed neurons are due to neurodevelopmental toxicity or to effects on mature neurons.

40|$|Certain {{esterase}} inhibitors, such as carbamates, phosphinates and sulfonyl halides, do {{not cause}} neuropathy as some organophosphates, {{but they may}} exacerbate chemical or traumatic insults to axons. This phenomenon is called promotion of axonopathies. Given the biochemical and toxicological characteristics of these compounds, the hypothesis was made that the target of promotion is a phenyl valerate (PV) esterase similar to neuropathy target esterase (NTE), the target of organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. However, attempts to identify a PV esterase in hen peripheral nerve have been, so far, unsuccessful. We tested several esters, other than PV, as substrates of esterases from crude homogenate of the hen peripheral nerve. The ideal substrate should be poorly hydrolysed by NTE but extensively by enzyme(s) that are insensitive to non-promoters, such as <b>mipafox,</b> and sensitive to promoters, such as phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). When phenyl benzoate (PB) was used as substrate, about 65 % of total activity was resistant to the non-promoter <b>mipafox</b> (up to 0. 5 mM, 20 min, pH 8. 0), that inhibits NTE and other esterases. More than 90 % of this resistant activity was sensitive to the classical promoter PMSF (1 mM, 20 min, pH 8. 0) with an IC(50) of about 0. 08 mM (20 min, pH 8. 0). On the contrary, the non-promoter p-toluene sulfonyl fluoride caused only about 10 % inhibition at 0. 5 mM. Several esterase inhibitors including, paraoxon, phenyl benzyl carbamate, di-n-butyl dichlorovinyl phosphate and di-isopropyl fluorophosphate, were tested both in vitro and in vivo for inhibition of this PB activity. Mipafox-resistant PMSF-sensitive PB esterase activity(ies) was inhibited by promoters but not by non promoters and neuropathic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Twelve rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm {{preparations}} {{were used}} to investigate the neuro-muscular interactions of propanidid, suxamethonium, tubocurarine and <b>mipafox</b> (an anticholinesterase compound). The potentiation of suxamethonium by propanidid was demonstrated to be a neuromuscular effect, and was increased by chemical inactivation of cholinesterase. A complex interaction between tubocurarine and propanidid was found. A hypothesis for these actions of propanidid is propounded. Suxamethonium produces a more prolonged period of apnoea after a propanidid induction of anaesthesia than after the same dose of suxameth-onium following a barbiturate induction (Howells et al., 1964; Clarke, Dundee and Daw, 1964).

40|$|The {{particulate}} fraction from hen {{brain was}} labelled with [3 H]di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DiPF) and separated by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Four radioactive protein bands (1 [...] 4) of molecular weights 155000, 92000, 60000, and 30000 were resolved. Most of the labelling of bands 2, 3 and 4 was inhibited by preincubation with Paraoxon. The residue in band 4 was sensitive to pH 5. 2. Successive treatments with Paraoxon and pH 5. 2 {{resulted in the}} abolition of bands 3 and 4. Bands 1 and 2 contained one and two polypeptides respectively, whose labelling was sensitive to <b>Mipafox,</b> but one, in band 2, was sensitive to higher concentrations of Paraoxon. The concentrations {{of the other two}} polypeptides were 6. 7 and 1. 95 pmol of DiPF bound/g of brain in bands 1 and 2 respectively. Both were as sensitive to <b>Mipafox</b> as neurotoxic esterase and were also sensitive to phenyl benzylcarbamate. 4 -Nitrophenyl di-n-pentylphosphinate given in vivo inhibited neurotoxic esterase and the labelling of the band- 1 polypeptide by 82 % and 84 % respectively, but inhibited the labelling of the band 2 polypeptide by 51 %. The phosphinate in vitro produced 98 % inhibition of the labelling of the band- 1 polypeptide, with only 26 % inhibition of the band- 2 polypeptide, under conditions sufficient to inhibit neurotoxic esterase totally. Both neurotoxic esterase and the band- 1 polypeptide were found in the forebrain at 1. 74 -fold their concentration {{in the rest of the}} brain, whereas the band- 2 polypeptide was uniformly distributed. The evidence indicates that the Mipafox-sensitive polypeptide in band 1 is the [3 H]DiPF-labelled active-site subunit of neurotoxic esterase.

40|$|Electrical {{transmural}} {{stimulation of}} the isolated guinea-pig ileum preparation which was distended by an intraluminal pressure insufficient to elicit peristalsis produced two effects, one a longitudinal contraction and the other an emptying response brought about by a co-ordinated propagated contraction of the circular muscle. The parameters of the electrical stimulus used were such that these effects were probably produced by {{stimulation of the}} nervous plexuses in {{the wall of the}} ileum. In the presence of the anticholinesterase NN-diisopropylphosphodiamidic fluoride (<b>Mipafox),</b> acetylcholine was detected in the fluid passing through the lumen and also in the fluid in the organ bath. The amount was increased after a period of electrical stimulation. As variation of the frequency of stimulation from 5 /min to 25 /sec did not alter statistically significantly the acetylcholine output, a frequency of 5 /min was used. Cooling to 13 ° C, the effect of local anaesthetic compounds and botulinum toxin reduced both the emptying response and longitudinal contractions of the ileum which followed transmural stimulation, with a concurrent reduction in acetylcholine output. It was concluded that the acetylcholine was released by electrical transmural stimulation from the intramural nerve plexuses in the wall of the guinea-pig ileum...|$|E
40|$|The {{intermediate}} syndrome in organophosphate poisoning is clinically {{characterized by}} {{weakness in the}} territory of cranial nerves, weakness of respiratory, neck and proximal limb muscles, and depressed deep tendon reflexes. It occurs between the acute cholinergic crisis and the usual onset of organophosphate-induced delayed neurotoxicity. The weakness has been ascribed to muscle fiber necrosis. Fenthion {{has been the most}} common cause. This study assesses the occurrence of the necrotizing myopathy in rats in relation to the clinical course and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition after poisoning with organophosphates representative for each of the major types of organophosphate-related neurotoxicity. Marked differences are noted in the duration of cholinergic symptoms and of AChE inhibition after either paraoxon and <b>mipafox,</b> or fenthion poisoning. The necrotizing myopathy begins shortly after the initial decline in AChE activity with all organophosphates studied. Maximal muscle involvement occurs within the first 2 days of the poisoning with all organophosphates studied. The myopathy is not aggravated by a further decline in AChE activity in fenthion poisoning. Our data argues against the monophasic necrotizing myopathy being the cause of the intermediate syndrome, and is suggestive of persistent AChE inhibition being involved.

40|$|The {{circular}} muscle strip {{is a new}} {{preparation for}} examining the action of drugs on the circular muscle of the guinea-pig isolated intestine. The preparation differed from the longitudinal muscle {{in that it was}} insensitive to drugs which act on autonomic effector tissues but, after inhibition of cholinesterase, it responded readily to choline esters, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, histamine and nicotine. This behaviour necessitated the treatment of each strip with the anticholinesterase NN-diisopropylphosphodiamidic fluoride (<b>mipafox)</b> before each experiment. The contractions of the strip by 5 -hydroxytryptamine, histamine and nicotine were abolished by procaine, botulinum toxin (Type A), morphine and hemicholinium, whilst the actions of acetylcholine and methacholine were unaffected. Contractions of the strip in response to each of the drugs were abolished by atropine and hyoscine. The action of nicotine was specifically antagonized by hexamethonium, that of 5 -hydroxytryptamine by desensitization of the tissue to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, and that of histamine either by desensitization of the tissue to histamine or by mepyramine. It is postulated that 5 -hydroxytryptamine, histamine and nicotine stimulate specific receptor sites within the intramural nerve plexuses of the guinea-pig isolated ileum. Finally, botulinum toxin (Type A), morphine or hemicholinum, acting on the neuronal elements of the intramural plexuses, depressed the contractions of the circular muscle strip due to histamine or nicotine more readily than those due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} found that NTE's {{catalytic}} activity is not regulated by cAMP. Purification of the R domain could not be achieved as the recombinant polypeptide is essentially insoluble and consequently, direct cAMP binding could not be attempted. The reduction of NTE activity in HeLa cells caused inhibition of GroPCho production without altering PtdCho levels. Conversely, the inducible overexpression of NTE in a stable HeLa cell line resulted in increased GroPCho production also without altering PtdCho levels. Treatment of HeLa cells with ether-linked lipids caused an apparent inhibition of PtdCho synthesis followed by a time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity that was not altered by the inducible overexpression of NTE. Several mouse tissues were screened and the highest NTE expression was found in kidney tubular epithelial cells. Tubular epithelial cells from NTE heterozygous (HZ) mutant mice demonstrated the same GroPCho and phospholipids levels as wild-type cells, despite a 40 % lower NTE PV hydrolase activity. The NTE HZ cells had 65 % the CDP-choline levels of wild-type cells suggesting a down-regulation of PtdCho synthesis. Greater reduction of NTE activity by treating wild-type tubular epithelial cells with <b>mipafox</b> resulted in a 90 % reduction in GroPCho production also accompanied by a down-regulation of PtdCho synthesis. In conclusion, changes in NTE activity, in both cell types, are compensated by corresponding changes in PtdCho synthesis to maintain phospholipids homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} a novel stable precursor, saligenin phosphorotrichloridate, which, on reaction with N-monobiotinyldiamines, {{generates a}} series of biotinylated covalent inhibitors of serine esterases. A homologue designated S 9 B [1 -(saligenin cyclic phospho) - 9 -biotinyldiaminononane] was selected to allow detection and rapid isolation of neuropathy target esterase (NTE). This enzyme is the primary target site for those organophosphorus esters (OPs) which cause delayed neuropathy. NTE comprises about 0. 03 % of the total protein in brain microsomal fractions and has resisted purification attempts over many years. S 9 B is a potent progressive inhibitor of NTE esteratic activity (second-order rate constant 1. 4 x 10 (7) M- 1. min- 1). Incubation of S 9 B with brain microsomes led to specific covalent labelling of NTE as determined by detection of a biotinylated 155 kDa polypeptide on Western blots. Specificity of S 9 B labelling was further demonstrated by inhibition with the neuropathic OP <b>mipafox.</b> Biotinyl-NTE in SDS-solubilized S 9 B-labelled microsomes was adsorbed on to avidin-Sepharose and subsequently eluted, yielding a fraction enriched approx. 1000 -fold in NTE by a single step with recoveries of 30 %. Essentially pure NTE was obtained after separation from two endogenous biotinylated polypeptides (120 and 70 kDa) in avidin-Sepharose eluates by preparative SDS/PAGE.

40|$|When the {{guinea-pig}} isolated ileum {{had been}} previously treated with the anticholinesterase, NN-diisopropylphosphodiamidic fluoride (<b>mipafox),</b> and attached to an isotonic lever loaded with 0. 5 g, it released acetylcholine into Krebs solution gassed {{with a mixture of}} 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide. The amount of acetylcholine spontaneously released depended on the duration of the rest period. Cocaine, procaine or cooling the preparation to 25 ° C greatly reduced this spontaneous output of acetylcholine, thus providing evidence in support of nervous origin of the ester. Reduction of the calcium ion content of the Krebs solution to one-twentieth of its usual value or increase in the magnesium ion content four-fold, changes which inhibit the release of acetylcholine from somatic motor nerve-endings, inhibited the output of acetylcholine from the ileum. When all the calcium of Krebs solution had been replaced by strontium one-third of the control output of acetylcholine was obtained, but the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig ileum would not respond to drugs under these conditions. Strontium could thus partially substitute for calcium in nerves but not in muscle. Hemicholinium- 3 (100 μg/ml.) inhibited the spontaneous release of acetylcholine and 400 μg/ml. of choline was required to reverse the inhibition. It is concluded that cocaine, procaine, cooling, reduction of calcium ion and increase of magnesium ion concentrations all reduce the spontaneous output of acetylcholine, which has its origin in the parasympathetic nerve-endings of the intramural nerve plexuses. Further, the hemicholinium experiments seem to justify the conclusion that the release of acetylcholine is reduced because synthesis is reduced...|$|E
40|$|Dose/response {{measurements}} {{were made on}} the guinea-pig isolated ileum with six agonists, acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, choline phenyl ether and histamine. The dose effects were repeated {{in the presence of}} each of twelve antagonists and one anticholinesterase. Acetylcholine and histamine were chosen because of their direct mode of action on smooth muscle, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether were used as examples of drugs that act at the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine was the drug investigated. Hyoscine blocked the contractions caused by acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine and the ganglion-stimulants but left the responses to histamine unchanged. The anticholinesterase N,N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidic fluoride (<b>mipafox)</b> potentiated all the agonists except histamine. The strength of potentiation decreased in the order 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether, and acetylcholine. The local anaesthetic procaine inhibited to the same extent contractions elicited by 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether. These results showed that 5 -hydroxytryptamine, like nicotine, choline phenyl ether and dimethylphenylpiperazinium, mediated its response through the nervous plexus. Of those tested 5 -hydroxytryptamine was the only specific antagonist to 5 -hydroxytryptamine; lysergic acid derivatives produced spasm and prolonged changes in tone; phenoxybenzamine caused non-specific block. The diverse modes of action of a number of ganglion-blocking agents were selectively used. Thus hexamethonium, pentolinium, and nicotine in its competitive phase, blocked contractions due to nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether and left those due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine and histamine unchanged. The depolarizing ganglion-blocking agents, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and nicotine, inhibited the responses to all the indirectly acting drugs. Furthermore, mecamylamine, a drug with a less well-defined mode of action, partially inhibited contractions due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine in a concentration that blocked those due to nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether. Pempidine, known to act like mecamylamine, did not antagonize 5 -hydroxytryptamine. It is concluded that 5 -hydroxytryptamine activates specific receptors sited at the intramural parasympathetic ganglion cells...|$|E
40|$|Estudamos um paciente com quadro clínico rebelde, produzido por intoxicação pelo Parathion. Foi observado um fenômeno miotônico transitório, não descrito na {{literatura}} revisada. A constatação de cifras de AchE eritrocitária baixas e de colinesterase plasmática normais, indicou que era portador de déficit congênito de AchE, esclarecendo-se a evolução crônica do seu quadro. O fenômeno miotônico associado ao quadro clínico, eletrofisiológico, histológico e bioquímico fazem deste paciente um modelo clínico, de etiologia conhecida, da discutida síndrome de Isaacs. A case of 38 {{year old}} man who worked with organochlorinated and Parathion during 5 years is reported. His follow-up was up to 2 years. The onset of the disease was characterized by cholinergic signs, headache, loss of weight, trembling, miokimias, fasciculations, ataxia, myotonic phenomena (in hands only) and motor sensitive peripheral polyneuropathy (affecting the lower limbs symmetrically). Low concentrations of blood cholinesterases confirmed the etiology. Myotonic phenomena disappeared spontaneuosly 6 months after the initial observation. One year later, the concentration of erytrocyte acetilcholinesterase {{was found to be}} low and plasma cholinesterase was normal, suggesting that the patient was carrier of a congenital deficiency of acetilcholinesterase. in literature relationship between myotonia and intoxication due to organophosphorus was not found. The whole clinical picture, cholinergic symptoms, transitory myotonic phenomena and spontaneous motor activity could be explained by an excess of acetilcholine. Eletromyography (EMG) in the first observation showed neuromuscular transmission blocking characterized by deficiency or absence of voluntary activity, unexcitability of fibular nerves, with fibrilations and positive peaks as described previously with <b>Mipafox</b> (another organophosphorus agent). During 2 years of observation numerous end-plates potentials of muscular fibres persisted in the EMG. A progressive increase in voluntary activity showed by unit motor potential of almost normal amplitude and very increased duration was observed. No potentials of reinnervation were noted. The results of EMG were explained as disturbances of neuromuscular transmission associated with moderate signs of denervation The Eaton-Lambert's test and the stimulation of a single unit motor potential confirmed disorder of neuromuscular synapses. The histochemistry of brachial biceps showed scattered atrophic and angulated type I and II fibres. Teased-fibres preparations showed nerve fibres with B, C, and G alterations as defined by Dyck et al. indicating axonal degeneration. These results were according to velocity of sensitive conduction. The conduction velocity of fibular nerves was strongly delayed during all the evolution indicating serious disorders of motor nerves myelin. We think that intoxication by organophosphorus should not be expressed as an identical alteration of both motor and sensitive nerves. The association of myotonic phenomena with such clinical, electrophysiological and histological picture is characteristic of the Isaac's syndrome model with known etiology...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) are ubiquitous in the environment. Some congeners produce extreme toxicity in laboratory Animal studies. While much attention has been given to the carcinogenicity, little work has been done in neurotoxicology. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was to analyze neurotoxicity by these measurements of cytotoxicity in neuronal and goal 11 lines. Amino acid incorporation into proteins, total protein, trypan blue dye exclusion and total cell count were measured as indicators of cytotoxicity. In addition acetycholinesterase (ACM) activity was measured as a direct indicator of neurotoxicity. Cells were exposed to three model PAHs, benzo(a) pyrene (BAP), cosine, and anthracene, and one model HAH, pentachlorophenol (PCP). Neurotoxicity of individual PAHs and PCP was compared with mixtures of PAHs and PCP. In this thesis SY 5 Y and C 6 cell lines were used. The test concentrations of each PAH and PCP were 0. 03, 0. 3, 3. 30 []M. BAP showed the highest mycotoxic of the compounds tested. At a dose of 3 []M or 30 []M, BAP produced a significant mycotoxic response in SY 5 Y cells. SY 5 Y cells teated with cosine, anthracene, and PCP showed no significant effects compared to controls. C 6 cells appeared to be less sensitive to the cytotoxicity then SY 5 Y cells. This finding may reject the lower level of P 450 activity compared with SY 5 Y cells. S 9 liver extras, which possesses high P 450 activity, was used to enhance metabolism of PAHs. In most cases, the individual PAHs were inactive in C 6 cells without agitation, while cytotoxicity was increased following S 9 metabolism. In the present study, the rank order of neurotoxicity was BAP > chrysene > anthracene. In SY 5 Y cells, mixtures of BAP and chrysene or BAP and PCP exhibited the same degree of cytotoxicity as did the individual chemicals. However, in C 6 cells the mixture of 3 []M BAP and 3 []M chrysene induced a more mycotoxic response than at same concentration of individual compounds. PCP at 3 []M alone significantly inhibited AChE activity in SY 5 Y cells, but BAP and chrysene had no effect. Furthermore, binary mixtures of PCP with <b>mipafox</b> together produced a significant increase in inhibition of AChE. These data suggest that co- exposure to PCP and organophosphates may result in a chemical interaction that increases the relative toxic response...|$|E
