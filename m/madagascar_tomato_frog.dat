50|$|The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> or crapaud rouge de Madagascar (Dyscophus antongilii) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Microhylidae.|$|E
50|$|Endemic to <b>Madagascar,</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are found}} in the {{northeast}} of the island around Antongil Bay (from which they gain their specific name, antongilii), and south to Andevoranto. The exact distribution of this species is unclear however, due to confusion with the closely related D. guineti.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 290 {{amphibian}} species in Madagascar with new species being found regularly. Nearly {{all of these are}} endemic and the majority are restricted to primary forest. Examples of well-known amphibian species found in <b>Madagascar</b> include <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> and golden mantella frog.|$|R
40|$|Madagascar is a {{biodiversity}} hotspot with {{a unique}} fauna and flora largely endemic at the species level and highly threatened by habitat destruction. The processes underlying population-level differentiation in Madagascar's biota are poorly understood and have been proposed {{to be related to}} Pleistocene climatic cycles, yet the levels of genetic divergence observed are often suggestive of ancient events. We combined molecular markers of different variability to assess the phylogeography of <b>Madagascar's</b> emblematic <b>tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> (Dyscophus guineti and D. antongilii) and interpret the observed pattern as resulting from ancient and recent processes. Our results suggest that the initial divergence between these taxa is probably old as reflected by protein-coding nuclear genes and by a strong mitochondrial differentiation of the southernmost population. Dramatic changes in their demography appear to have been triggered {{by the end of the}} last glacial period and possibly by the short return of glacial conditions known as the 8 K event. This dramatic change resulted in an approximately 50 -fold reduction of the effective population size in various populations of both species. We hypothesize these species' current mitochondrial DNA diversity distribution reflects a swamping of the mitochondrial genetic diversity of D. guineti by that of D. antongilii previous to the populations' bottlenecks during the Holocene, and probably as a consequence of D. antongilii demographic expansion approximately 1 million years ago. Our data support the continued recognition of D. antongilii and D. guineti as separate species and flag D. guineti as the more vulnerable species to past and probably also future environmental changes...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> is {{classified}} as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List, and listed on Appendix I of CITES. [...] Numbers of the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> have been declining {{as a result of}} habitat degradation and pollution and the over-collection of these brightly coloured amphibians for the pet trade. Collecting activity, and the associated decline in population, was predominately focused near to the town of Maroantsetra. The <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> was rapidly included on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in response to this pressure.|$|R

50|$|The {{common name}} comes from D. antongiliis bright red color. When threatened, a <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> puffs up its body. When a {{predator}} grabs a <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> in its mouth, the frogs skin secretes a thick substance that gums up the predators eyes and mouth, causing the predator to release the frog to free up its eyes. The gummy substance contains a toxin that occasionally causes allergic reactions in humans. The allergic reaction will not kill a human and the frog secretes it only when frightened.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are any of}} {{the three}} species of genus Dyscophus (family Microhylidae): D. antongilii, D. insularis, or D. guineti. Dyscophus is the only genus in {{subfamily}} Dyscophinae. They are endemic to Madagascar ...|$|R
5000|$|Females {{are much}} larger than males, {{reaching}} up to 10.5 cm and 230 g in weight (6.5 cm and 41 g for males). <b>Tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> {{live up to their}} name by possessing a vibrant, orange-red colour. Females are {{much larger than}} males and have brighter tones of red or orange on their back, with a pale undersurface. [...] Some individuals also have black spots on the throat. It is thought that the brilliant colours of the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> act as a warning to potential predators that these frogs are toxic; a white substance secreted from the skin acts as a glue to deter predators (such as colubrid snakes) and can produce an allergic reaction in humans.|$|R
50|$|The false <b>tomato</b> <b>frog,</b> Dyscophus guineti, is {{a species}} of frog in the family Microhylidae.It is endemic to Madagascar.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, swamps, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and heavily degraded former forest.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifespan}} of the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> can be from 6 to 8 years.When adult, {{the colors}} may vary from yellowish orange to deep red. <b>Tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> will reach sexual maturity in 9-14 months. Females {{are larger than}} males and can reach 4 inches in length. Males can reach 2 to 3 inches in length. Most females range from reddish-orange bright dark red. The bellies are usually more yellowish, and sometimes there are black spots on the throat. But males are not as brightly colored but more of a duller orange or brownish-orange. Juveniles are also dull in color and develop brighter coloration as they mature. They {{are also on the}} endangered species list. They breed in the rainy season and are nocturnal. They tend to eat small insects and invertebrates.|$|R

50|$|Research into captive {{breeding}} {{techniques for}} the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> {{has been carried}} out by Baltimore Zoo in the United States in an effort to boost the currently small and genetically deprived captive population that exists in that country. A consortium of U.S. zoos that form the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG) have established an exhibit at the Parc Zoologique Ivoloina, Madagascar in an attempt to help educate local people about this attractive member of their natural heritage. Very {{little is known about the}} <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> and further research into its distribution, behaviour and potential threats is urgently needed before effective conservation measures can be put into place. It is currently listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), but this move has been criticised by some authors as an ineffective strategy and one that has undermined the status of the unlisted D. guineti. Furthermore, research is needed to determine if D. antongilii is in fact a separate species or merely a variant of D. guineti.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> {{breed in}} February to March {{following}} heavy rainfall; {{the sounds of}} males calling to attract females can be heard around small water bodies in the dark Malagasy night. Following copulation, females will lay a clutch of 1,000 to 15,000 eggs {{on the surface of}} the water. Tadpoles hatch from these small black and white eggs about 36 hours later; they are only around six millimetres long and feed by filter-feeding. Tadpoles undergo metamorphosis into yellow juveniles and this stage is completed around 45 days after the eggs were laid.|$|R
40|$|Except for polyploidy, {{parthenogenesis}} and hybridogenesis, {{the role}} of chromosome rearrangements in speciation is still highly debated. This paper highlights an unusual karyotype diversification and a putative case of chromosomal speciation in the endemic Malagasy <b>tomato</b> <b>frogs.</b> The <b>tomato</b> <b>frogs</b> include Dyscophus insularis {{as well as the}} sister species D. antongilii and D. guineti, which are characterized by a disjunct distribution and a low genetic divergence, probably due to a recent hybridization. Our results show that the three Dyscophus species present 2 n = 26 biarmed chromosomes, differing in chromatin pattern. Interestingly, both sexes of D. guineti show a heteromorphic chromosome pair 11, with one element larger (11 a) than the other (11 b) due to the presence of a large terminal tract on the short arm with an euchromatic band enclosed between two heterochromatic bands. This fixed condition reminds that of some newts of the genus Triturus, but in Dyscophus it probably characterizes the beginning of a cladogenetic process. We hypothesize that in D. guineti the raising of the heteromorphic 11 th chromosome pair followed the hybridization with D. antongilii, originating a post-zygotic barrier and representing a case of sympatric or parapatric chromosomal speciation. This speciation mechanism may also have had important biogeographic consequences, shaping the current disjunct distribution of D. antongilii and D. guineti, so far not sufficiently explaine...|$|R
40|$|Age {{profile and}} body size were studied in three {{populations of the}} rare and understudied <b>tomato</b> <b>frog,</b> Dyscophus antongilii, from NE Madagascar. For each individual, a phalanx was clipped and the bone used for skeletochronology. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is significantly different between all three populations: females are larger and heavier than males, with males also being distinguishable by a more yellowish throat. Age structure analysis was possible on two populations (Antara, Lampirano). The age within the two populations ranged {{between 3 and 7}} years (mean ± SD = 5. 0 ± 0. 2) for males, and 3 to 11 years (mean ± SD = 5. 8 ± 0. 3) for females. Longevity was positively correlated to body size and weight within both sexes and populations. Sexual maturity was reached between 2 and 3 years, with sexual maturity recorded for males signifi- cantly lower than for females...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. *The false <b>tomato</b> <b>frog,</b> Dyscophus guineti, is an {{endemic species}} of eastern Madagascar, {{typically}} found in open and swampy areas of mid-elevation forests. We measured 62 females and 70 males from a population from Marovato, next to Brickaville. Snout-vent {{length of the}} individuals ranged from 37. 7 - 112. 4 mm in females and 37. 7 - 90. 7 mm in males, while the mass varied within the range 25. 0 - 80. 2 g in males and 25. 8 - 145. 6 g in females. Skeletochronological analysis was conducted on clipped phalanges of 20 males and 20 females. The results of these analyses indicated that the age range was 3 - 7 years in females and 3 - 6 years in males, and that sexual maturity was attained between 2 and 4 years, comparatively earlier in males than in females. There was a significant correlation between age and size in females. This species appears larger in size but less long-lived than the sister-species D. antongilii...|$|R
40|$|Based on daily {{monitoring}} {{around an}} urban pond {{in the coastal}} town of Maroantsetra, from 2003 - 2011, we provide {{an analysis of the}} yearly reproductive activity of the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> (Dyscophus antongilii), a large-sized and prominent red-coloured microhylid frog from north-eastern Madagascar. Frogs were observed all year round but despite the limited climatic seasonality in the region it was possible to identify a high activity period between January-May and a lower activity period between June-December. Freshly laid eggs were found in all months except November, and with highest incidence between January and May, while calling was heard in all months. We found a positive correlation between daily adult counts and minimum air temperature. On the contrary rainfall did not significantly predict activity, although boosts of calling and egg-laying especially in the austral winter were observed after heavy rainfall events. We define D. antongilii in Maroantsetra as a sporadic wet season breeder that reproduces at irregular intervals following heavy rain events...|$|R
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 24 October 1990, {{this episode}} looks at those that hunt other creatures {{and ways of}} {{avoiding}} capture. Attenborough is attacked {{by a pair of}} skuas as he approaches their nest, which demonstrates this particular bird's aggressive behaviour, both when taking food and defending its young. Off the shores of Patagonia, the same group of killer whales returns each year to ambush sea lion pups, which stray out of the safer shallow waters. Having grabbed their prey, they take it back out to sea and 'play' with it for some time before killing it. Poison can be used both as a weapon and a deterrent, such as by the viper and <b>tomato</b> <b>frog</b> respectively. Some animals advertise their defensive measures in advance, in case deployment occurs too late. Among them are the skunk, which discharges an appalling smell, and some salamanders that display their toxicity by remaining stationary, with their warning markings visible. Several species of stick insect and their elaborate camouflage are shown. However, none of these methods of protection pose problems to army ants, which can subdue any of their prey, simply by virtue of their size and vast numbers. The Harris hawk is unusual, since it hunts in teams, and a group of six are shown practising their skill in the desert of New Mexico. The final sequence depicts a troop of chimpanzees displaying strategy and co-ordination as it successfully pursues colobus monkeys through a forest in the Ivory Coast.|$|R
40|$|Tomato {{has become}} an {{economically}} viable diversification crop for the strongly rice-oriented farming system in <b>Madagascar.</b> As <b>tomatoes</b> have a relatively short shelf life, this crop is mainly grown within the vicinity of large towns such as the capital Antananarivo. It is still, however, a high risk product for different stakeholders in the food commodity subsector because of its perishability and year-to-year variability in market prices. The cost-effective but risky aspect of tomatoes has prompted farmers and sellers to adapt. Tomato cropping and marketing calendars have been adjusted to ensure that tomatoes are marketed throughout the year to stabilize prices and secure earnings. A study of the Ambohidrazana cropping area in the hilly region east of Antananarivo indicated that farmers are, to an increasing extent, taking market variables into account when making cropping decisions. It was also noted that this subsector {{has been able to}} adapt to its physical environment by striving to overcome constraints to intensification and expansion of tomato cropping on poor periurban soils. The fact that farmers, supported by research, have taken the initiative to use urban waste as humus to fertilize tomato plots indicates a promising future for this subsector. Vitality has also been boosted via challenges associated with product diversification and quality improvement to meet consumer demand. The <b>tomato</b> subsector in <b>Madagascar</b> is striving concomitantly to diversify the diet of Malagasy people and to enhance income security for stakeholders...|$|R
