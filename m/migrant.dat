5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first <b>migrant</b> workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the <b>Migrant</b> Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried <b>migrant</b> workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards <b>migrant</b> workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force <b>migrant</b> workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E

5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the industrialization drive in export-oriented development, and its reliance on low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market. Young <b>migrant</b> women left their homes in rural settings to work in urban industrial areas. Work included export-oriented industrialization, manufacturing in electronics and toy assembly, sewing in garment production, and mixed assembly and sewing in the footwear industry. Hong Kong and Shenzhen were cities established as centers of export-oriented industrialization, and <b>migrant</b> women workers have made up 70% of Shenzhen's three million people.|$|E

30|$|Relative {{to other}} <b>migrants,</b> EaP <b>migrants</b> and <b>migrants</b> from the EU {{enlargement}} member states arrived most recently to Spain. On average, EaP <b>migrants</b> {{have been in}} Spain {{for a little more}} than 5  years – about half the average length of African <b>migrants.</b> Most likely this explains the concentration of EaP <b>migrants</b> and those from the EU enlargement member states in low-earning occupations relative to their African and South American counterparts.|$|R
30|$|The {{average age}} of {{potential}} illegal <b>migrants</b> is slightly lower (24 years) than that of potential legal <b>migrants</b> (27 years). The proportion of married people among potential legal <b>migrants</b> is almost double (32 %) that among potential illegal <b>migrants</b> (17 %). The proportions of dependent people are higher for potential legal <b>migrants</b> than for potential illegal <b>migrants.</b> The average education level in the sample is secondary, with 27 % of people having reached this level. It {{is interesting to note}} that 55 % of potential illegal <b>migrants</b> have a low level of education, whereas they represent 33 % of potential legal <b>migrants.</b> Only 5 % of potential illegal <b>migrants</b> have a university level, which is five times less than in the population of potential legal <b>migrants.</b> People living in a house that they or their family own represent 56 % of the sample, which does not greatly vary according to the legal or illegal consideration of migration. Interestingly, a larger percentage among the potential illegal <b>migrants</b> belong to the Mouride brotherhood 9 (54 %) than among the potential legal <b>migrants</b> (39 %).|$|R

5|$|This {{new system}} allowed rural {{residents}} to migrate, {{it did not}} allow them to change their residence or accept any benefits in the cities. This resulted in a growing population of <b>migrant</b> laborers without the minimal benefits of residency including medical care, housing, or education. Many <b>migrant</b> women do not trust the government to protect their rights. Today, up to 90% of migrants work without contracts, in violation of the Chinese labour law.|$|E
5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female <b>migrant</b> workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the <b>migrant</b> women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} explain the stylized fact that many countries have a low ratio of <b>migrants</b> in their population while some countries have a high ratio of <b>migrants.</b> Immigration improves the income of the domestic residents, but <b>migrants</b> also increase the congestion of public services. If <b>migrants</b> are unskilled and therefore pay low taxes, and {{the government does not}} limit access to these services, then the welfare of the domestic residents decreases with the number of <b>migrants.</b> Visa auctions can lower the cost of immigration control and substitute legal <b>migrants</b> for illegal <b>migrants.</b> If the government decides to limit the access of <b>migrants</b> to public services, immigration control becomes unnecessary and the optimal number of <b>migrants</b> can be very large...|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} from this study imply that <b>migrants</b> in cities in Vietnam are not underpaid. There is no discrimination against <b>migrants.</b> The main reason why <b>migrants</b> have lower wages than non-migrants is the gap in age and education between <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants. To obtain higher wages, <b>migrants</b> should have better education and improve working skills through vocational training.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} the wage gap between <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants {{in large cities}} in Vietnam. It finds that <b>migrants</b> receive substantially lower wages than non-migrants. The wage gap tends to be larger for older <b>migrants.</b> However, once observed demographic characteristics of workers are controlled, there are no differences in wages between <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants. The main difference in observed wages between <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants is explained by differences in age and education between <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants.|$|R
5|$|Although the Hong Kong {{government}} has enacted legislation which nominally protects <b>migrant</b> workers, recourse is time-consuming {{and the costs}} considerable.

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against <b>migrant</b> workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a <b>migrant</b> minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
30|$|As urban <b>migrants</b> {{and rural}} <b>migrants</b> differ only in hukou status, we {{interpret}} the unexplained {{component of the}} decomposition as discrimination against rural hukou status. By comparing urban <b>migrants</b> with both rural <b>migrants</b> and urban residents, {{results suggest that the}} presumed absence of income discrimination against rural <b>migrants</b> is in fact the net effect of a discrimination against a rural hukou status and a premium accrued by both rural and urban <b>migrants</b> in the labour market.|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the linked topics of internal migration and occupational discrimination against <b>migrants.</b> The data, collected from 21 manufacturing companies in Shanghai, indicate that <b>migrants</b> are a heterogeneous group {{in terms of}} their origins. <b>Migrants</b> from rural areas are the least well-educated. In contrast, <b>migrants</b> from other cities in China have attained significantly higher education than local workers in Shanghai. Much of the literature compares the occupations of rural <b>migrants</b> and local residents; urban <b>migrants</b> are often neglected. By examining occupational patterns for rural <b>migrants,</b> urban <b>migrants</b> and local workers, this study adds to the literature through a full assessment of occupational inequalities.

The largest local clusters of <b>migrants</b> in the EU 15 {{are found in the}} Île-de-France as well as in Inner and Outer London. The settlement structure of <b>migrants</b> is markedly different relative to natives: 23. 9 percent of all <b>migrants</b> would have to change their region of residence in order to achieve a uniform distribution of <b>migrants</b> across EU- 15 countries. <b>Migrants</b> from the eight CEE EU countries show a lower degree of concentration than those from Bulgaria and Romania or the candidate countries, while they are more regionally concentrated than <b>migrants</b> from other countries. The biggest local clusters of <b>migrants</b> from the new EU countries can be observed in the Greater London area and in Vienna. Looking at individual sending countries, Polish <b>migrants</b> show the least tendency to cluster regionally.
