Using the blob velocity dataset from the Langmuir array as a reference with which to compare the Mach probe data, the theory of unmagnetized Mach probes is be tested. Additionally, the inverse proportionality between blob speed and neutral pressure shown to exist in a previous study of blobs in the VTF is confirmed by Mach probe data. Finally, data from the array show that the blobs are rotating clockwise with Mach numbers of between 0. 1 and 0. 2, although the mechanism driving this rotation is unknown. by Brian Kardon.

40|$|A Functionally Gradient Material (FGM) part is a 3 D solid {{object that}} has varied local {{material}} composition that {{is defined by}} a specifically designed function.

As {{part of the project}} of design automation of FGM parts, this thesis focuses {{on the issue of the}} development of efficient algorithms for design and composition interrogation. Starting with a finite element based 3 D model, the design tool based on the distance function from the surface of the part and the design tool allowing the user to design within a. STL file require enhanced efficiency and so does the interrogation of the part. The approach for improving efficiency includes preprocessing the model with bucket sorting, digital distance transform of the buckets and an efficient point classification algorithm. Based on this approach, an efficient algorithm for distance function computation is developed for the design of FGM through distance to the surface of the part or distance to a. STL surface boundary. Also an efficient algorithm for composition evaluation at a point, along a ray or on a plane is developed. The theoretical time complexities of the developed algorithms are analyzed and experimental numerical results are provided. by Hongye Liu. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Vanadium dioxide (VO_ 2) {{undergoes}} a metal-insulator transition (MIT) at 340 K with the structural change between tetragonal and monoclinic crystals {{as the temperature}} is lowered. The conductivity σ drops at <b>MIT</b> by four <b>orders</b> of magnitude. The low-temperature monoclinic phase {{is known to have}} a lower ground-state energy. The existence of a k-vector k is prerequisite for the conduction since the k appears in the semiclassical equation of motion for the conduction electron (wave packet). Each wave packet is, by assumption, composed of the plane waves proceeding in the k direction perpendicular to the plane. The tetragonal (VO_ 2) _ 3 unit cells are periodic along the crystal's x-, y-, and z-axes, and hence there are three-dimensional k-vectors. The periodicity using the non-orthogonal bases does not legitimize the electron dynamics in solids. There are one-dimensional k along the c-axis for a monoclinic crystal. We believe this decrease in the dimensionality of the k-vectors is the cause of the conductivity drop. Triclinic and trigonal (rhombohedral) crystals have no k-vectors, and hence they must be insulators.

40|$|Research on Procurement Risk Management {{has been}} {{conducted}} by Accenture and <b>MIT</b> in <b>order</b> to identify the best practices used to manage commodity price volatility and supplier risk. In today's increasingly turbulent market it is crucial for companies to have their procurement risk management capabilities developed. Risk Management becomes imperative for buyers {{in order to make}} the best business decisions and continue to drive their performance up. Risk Management is now becoming a major requirement for Procurement departments, and while most companies have risk-management expertise within their finance departments, only a few formally extend this capacity into the procurement department. Excellence in managing risks will be a key differentiator for procurement departments in the near future. The main risk categories today are suppliers and price risks. These risks can be managed by different sets of capabilities in an effort to reduce a possible impact. The risk management process contains three main stages; risk anticipation, risk identification and monitoring, and risk mitigation. As all stages are important to master, some capabilities have shown clearer correlation than others. By conducting an extended literature review, procurement top management personnel interviews, and brainstorming sessions with Accenture, a set of hypotheses were formed. This set of hypotheses was verified against the results of a survey. The survey contained an extended set of questions that revolved around each hypothesis. This survey was answered by 122 companies from various industries. The main conclusions are based on observations and detailed analysis of survey results. A lack of impact measuring and a lack of use of technology for the purpose of risk assessment were observed. It is believed that improving these capabilities will promote profitability, and prevent impact as a result of risky events. Based on the results analysis, the procurement performance level is heavily dependant on risk management measures, and that excelling at the procurement level can be reflected further on the overall success of the company. by Maya Olsha.

40|$|Vanadium Oxide {{has been}} a frontrunner {{in the field of}} oxide {{electronics}} because of its metal-insulator transition (MIT). The interplay of different structures of VO 2 has {{played a crucial role in}} deciding the magnitude of the first <b>order</b> <b>MIT.</b> Substitution doping has been found to introduce different polymorphs of VO 2. Hence the role of substitution doping in stabilizing the competing phases of VO 2 in the thin film form remains underexplored. Consequently there have been reports both discounting and approving such a stabilization of competing phases in VO 2. It is reported in the literature that the bandwidth of the hysteresis and transition temperature of VO 2 can be tuned by substitutional doping of VO 2 with W. In this work, we have adopted a novel technique called, Ultrasonic Nebulized Spray Pyrolysis of Aqueous Combustion Mixture (UNSPACM) to deposit VO 2 and W- doped VO 2 as thin films. XRD and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the role of tungsten on the structure of VO 2 thin films. Morphology of the thin films was found to be consisting of globular and porous nanoparticles of size ∼ 20 nm. Transition temperature decreased with the addition of W. We found that for 2. 0 at % W doping in VO 2, the transition temperature has reduced from 68 o C to 25 o C.

In addition, the researcher also examined the MIT Library statistics: Data in relations to volumes of print serial and monograph acquired, total number of issues, total number of library visits, total reference enquiries from 2003 to 2008 was analysed and then presented in charts, graphs and tables. The majority of respondents from the online questionnaire were found to be undergraduate fulltime students between the age of 20 - 25, and they were mainly female students. More than half of the respondents reported they can easily find the place to carry out individual study and group work.

40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} and {{chalcogenides}} are an ideal platform for demonstrating and investigating many interesting electronic phases of matter. These phases {{emerge as a}} result of collective many body interactions among the electrons. The omnipresent electron, depending on its interaction with other electrons and with the underlying lattice, can generate diverse phases of matter with exotic physical properties. The ultimate objective of Materials Science is to provide a complete microscopic understanding of these myriad electronic phases of matter. A proper understanding of the collective quant-tum behaviour of electrons in different system can also help in designing and tuning new electronic phases of matter that may have strong impact in the field of microelectronics, well beyond that predicted by Moore s law. Strong electron correlation effects produce a wide spectrum of ground state prop-retires like superconductivity, Metal Insulator Transition (<b>MIT),</b> charge-orbital <b>ordering</b> and many more. Similarly, different spin interactions among electrons, essentially due to various kinds of exchange coupling, give rise to varying magnetic ground state prop-retires like ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism, spin glass, among others. The main objective of this thesis is to understand and rationalize diverse electronic and magnetic phases of matter in some selected strongly correlated systems. In chapter 1 we have provided an overview of various electronic and magnetic phases of matter which are relevant and necessary for understanding the chapters that follow. The first part of this chapter describes the fundamental concepts of the so called Metal Insulator Transition (MIT). A small section is dedicated to the subtle interactions among electrons and lattice that actually drive a system from a highly conducting metallic state to a strongly resistive insulating state. The second part of this chapter offers a compilation of different magnetic ground states which are discussed in detail in the last two chapters. In Chapter 2, we have explained various methodologies and experimental tech-antiques that have been used in the work reported in this thesis. In Chapter 3, we have provided a detailed understanding of the MIT in different polymorphic forms of Vanadium dioxide (VO 2). Although VO 2 exhibits a number of polymorphic forms, only the rutile/monoclinic VO 2 phase has been studied extensively compared to other polymorphic forms. This phase shows a well-established MIT across ∼ 340 K, which has been extensively investigated {{in order to understand the}} relative importance of many body electron correlation effects arising primarily from on-site Coulomb interactions within the Vanadium 3 d manifold, and single electron effects flounced by the dimerization of Vanadium atoms. Unlike the rutile phase of VO 2, little is known about the MIT appearing across 212 K in the metastable B-phase of VO 2. This phase shows dimerization of only half of the Vanadium atoms in the insulating state, in contrast to rutile/monoclinic VO 2, which show complete dimerization. There is a long standing debate about the origin of the MIT in the rutile/monoclinic phase, that contrasts the role of the many-body Hubbard U term, with single particle effects of the dimerization. In light of this debate, the MIT in the B-phase offers a unique opportunity to understand and address the competition between many body and single particle effects, that has been unresolved over several decades. In this chapter we have investigated different polymorphs of VO 2 to understand the underlying electronic structure and the nature of the MIT in these polymorphic forms. The MIT in VO 2 B phase is very broad in nature. X-ray photoemission and optical conductivity data indicate that in case of VO 2 B phase both correlation effects and dimerization is necessary to drive the MIT. We have also established that the correlation effects are more prominent for VO 2 B phase compared to rutile/monoclinic phase. In Chapter 4, we have discussed the electronic structure of LaTiO 3 (LTO) -SrTiO 3 (STO) system. At the interface between polar LTO and non-polar (STO) oxides, an unique two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) like state appears, that exhibits a phenomenal range of unexpected transport, magnetic, and electronic properties. Thus, this interface stands as a prospective candidate for not only fundamental scientific investigation, but also application in technological and ultimately commercial frontiers. In this chapter, using variable energy Hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), we have experimentally investigated the layer resolved evolution of electronic structure across the interface in LTO-STO system. HAXPES results suggest that the interface is more coherent in nature and the coherent to incoherent feature ratio changes significantly as we probe deeper into the layer In chapter 5, we have investigated the electronic structure of the chemically exfoliated trigonal phase of MoS 2. This elusive trigonal phase exists only as small patches on chemically exfoliated MoS 2, and is believed to control functioning of MoS 2 based devices. Its electronic structure is little understood, with total absence of any spec-troscopic data, and contradictory claims from theoretical investigations. We have ad-dressed this issue experimentally by studying the electronic structure of few layered chemically exfoliated MoS 2 systems using spatially resolved X-ray photoemission spec-otoscopy and micro Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with electronic structure calculations. We have established that the ground state of this unique trigonal phase is actually a small gap (∼ 90 meV) semiconductor. This is in contrast with most of the claims in existing literature. In chapter 6, we have re-examined and revaluated the electronic structure of the late 3 d transition metal monoxides (NiO, FeO, and CoO) using a combination of HAX-PES and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We have observed a strong evolution in the valence band spectra as a function of excitation energy. Theoretical results show that a combined GW+LDA+DMFT scheme is essential for explaining the observed experimental findings. Additionally, variable temperature HAXPES measurement In chapter 8, we have differentiated the surface and the bulk electronic structure in Sr 2 FeMoO 6 and also have provided a new route to increase the Curie temperature of this material. Sr 2 FeMoO 6 is well known for its high Curie temperature (Tc ∼ 410 K), half-metallic ferromagnetism, and a spectacularly large tunnelling magnetoresistance. The surface electronic structure of Sr 2 FeMoO 6 is believed to be different from the bulk; leading to a Spin-Valve type Magnetoresistance. We have carried out variable energy HAXPES on Sr 2 FeMoO 6 to probe electronic structure as a function of surface depth. Our experimental results indicate that surface is more Mo 6 + rich. We have also demonstrated what we believe is the first direct experimental evidence of hard ferro-magnetism in the surface layer using X Ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) with dual detection mode. In the second part of this chapter we have designed a new route to increase the Curie temperature and have been successfully able to achieve a Curie temperature as high as 515 K...|$|R
