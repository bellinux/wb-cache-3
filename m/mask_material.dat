40|$|Recently, PM 2. 5 (particulate {{matter with}} {{diameter}} of 2. 5 micron or less) {{has become a}} major health hazard from the polluted air in many cities in China. The regular gauze masks are used to prevent inhaling the PM 2. 5 fine particles; however, those masks are not able to filter out the PM 2. 5 because of the large porosity of the mask materials. Some well-prevented masks usually have poor breathability, which increases other health risks. In this study, a polysulfone based nanofiber for mask filtration material was synthesized by electrospinning.
