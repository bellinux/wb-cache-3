25|$|The {{words are}} {{somewhat}} generic: henqêe {{may be used}} for any spotted cat, hushuee (hushuwee) for any running ground bird. 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root. Blench (2008) thinks this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the eland being considered magical in the region.|$|E
500|$|On February 6, 1999, a team {{of three}} biologists, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, {{investigate}} a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small New York town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered {{a hole in the}} ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a [...] "snow shark", before it bites him.|$|E
500|$|Pattycake moved {{permanently}} to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982. For a few years, {{she lived}} in a cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. [...] In June 1999, Pattycake moved into the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. [...] The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as [...] "independent" [...] with [...] "few close friends" [...] in the Congo Gorilla Forest. [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact that}} she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years," [...] Doherty said.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this period}} Sally had shown a decided {{preference}} for the ungrammatical language of the seamen, though she associated freely with Young and Christian. Perhaps her particular fondness for John Adams <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with this.|$|R
50|$|This {{class had}} two subclasses, which were mostly {{different}} in the forms, but they shared the suffix -ai- in some. The two subclasses merged into one in all the later languages {{for reasons that are}} not quite clear, but presumably the fact that they shared some endings <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it.|$|R
50|$|Erik Greene, a {{relative}} of Sam Cooke, has cited similarities {{in the deaths of}} Cooke and Fuller. Fuller bandmate Jim Reese suspected that Charles Manson <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Fuller's death but never provided credible evidence. A sensationalist crime website has speculated that the LAPD <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been involved because of Bobby's connection to a Mafia-related woman.|$|R
500|$|Lapinskas {{previously}} had teased that Anthony {{would get a}} love interest and in November 2011, Anthony started dating Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright). Lapinskas deemed his character [...] "pleased that somebody likes him", and said {{that while he was}} also interested in Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington), he was put [...] "on the spot" [...] by Poppy and so did what he thought was expected of him in asking her out. He and Jodie later kissed; Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy and decide to leave London. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony had landed himself in a big mess, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÉ, [...] " [...] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to Jodie when she finds out they have kissed." ...|$|E
500|$|In 19 September 2011 episode, Poppy {{discovers that}} Jodie's fiance Darren (Hawkins) has cheated on her. Hawkins {{assessed}} the situation Poppy was in: [...] "as everyone knows, Poppy's loyalties lie with Jodie– they're super best friends! Poppy wants Darren to own up straight away, because {{she feels that}} if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well". He explained, [...] "Poppy doesn't want to see Jodie in pain, but she can't keep the secret". Poppy and Jodie were reportedly used to add humour to the soap, {{in the style of}} reality-drama series The Only Way Is Essex, but The Sun assessed that the attempt had [...] "flopped". On 24 October 2011 it was announced that the pair were to leave the show. Her departure storyline saw her to start to date Anthony (Lapinskas), who considered his character to be [...] "pleased that somebody likes him". He added that while his character was also interested in Jodie, he did what he thought was expected of him in asking Poppy out. After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony was heading for trouble, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÉ, [...] " [...] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to Jodie when she finds out they have kissed". The Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly and the Daily Star Susan Hill confirmed that Poppy would forgive Jodie, and they made their final appearance on 14 November 2011. According to an EastEnders spokesperson, there was potential for Poppy to return in the future; in an interview with Inside Soap, EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "We may see Poppy pop up as I'm a big fan of Rachel Bright and the character, but Kylie is keen to pursue other roles".|$|E
2500|$|Beldham's sister Hannah (1786–1842) married another leading cricketer of the day, John Wells. [...] As late as 1861, {{forty years}} after his last {{important}} game {{and while he was}} still living, a wall of The Cricketers pub in Wrecclesham still bore the legend [...] "Rendezvous of those Famous Cricketers Beldham & Wells" [...] (another version has the sign as [...] "Good Beer as drunk by those Famous Men Beldham & Wells"). That an early landlord of this pub may well have been one of Beldham's brothers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with this early example of celebrity endorsement.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the members}} of the {{parliamentary}} committee investigating Beheshti's death, Javad Karimi Ghoddusi, has suggested foreigners are responsible for the death. Hamid Dashti states Ghodusi claimed that [...] "BBC Persian <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with" [...] Beheshti's death, or that some of the [...] "political prisoners who had testified publicly that he was tortured <b>may</b> <b>have</b> killed him".|$|R
60|$|It is {{possible}} that the two tremendous blows which Zeppa had received during the mutiny <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with his madness; but {{there can be no doubt}} that the intense mutual affection which had subsisted between him and his only child, and the sudden and awful manner of that child's end, were of themselves sufficient to account for it.|$|R

2500|$|When {{both the}} Williams sisters entered {{the top ten}} and started meeting in tournaments, {{unsubstantiated}} rumors of match fixing started to circulate. John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that [...] "Serena may {{not be allowed to}} win. Richard <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about this." [...] Elena Dementieva, a fellow professional player, said during a post match interview after losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, that Richard Williams decided the results between the two sisters. Venus pulling out at the last minute garnered much speculation in the press, with fans demanding their money back.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} evade this {{psychological}} obstacle, the new poet must convince himself that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving {{open the possibility}} that he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> add to the tradition after all. The new poet's love for his heroes turns into antagonism towards them: [...] "Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible." [...] The book that followed Yeats, The Anxiety of Influence, which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of Walter Jackson Bate's The Burden of the Past and The English Poet and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which a poet broke free from his precursors to achieve his own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between [...] "strong poets" [...] who perform [...] "strong misreadings" [...] of their precursors, and [...] "weak poets" [...] who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of [...] "revisionary ratios," [...] through which each strong poet passes {{in the course of his}} career.|$|E

50|$|Recorded {{incidents}} of amafufunyana {{appear to have}} begun in the early 20th century and researchers such as Ngubane et al have suggested that its cultural formation <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with colonialism and migration of indigenous peoples away from their homes. There have also been widespread outbreaks of the condition, similar to events involving contagious spread of hysteria, recorded in the 1980s at a rural girl's boarding school.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} to have worked on two large paintings, both dated 1659, for churches in the Northern Netherlands. That Carel van Savoyen {{received}} the commission for these two altarpieces <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the connections of his wife's wealthy Catholic family, which made him the brother-in-law of an Amsterdam priest. The prestige of Flemish art with the Amsterdam elite of the day <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> played a role.|$|R
25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons seem a little complicated and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|R

It was, of course, reprehensible of me to be led away by it, especially as when I took the contract I really didn't care if the flume was never built." ...|$|R
40|$|The Hindu has {{no sense}} of history', said Mr Ratan on my last evening in Bombay. It was not a new {{statement}} since I had been reminded of it many times before. Its suddenness <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with my own tendency to relapse into the anecdotal and the inconsequential but it did seem a bit odd nevertheless that here I was faced with this bald statement {{after only a few}} minutes of hurried acquaintance [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Also, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the decline in industrial sector employment, the service industry of the Netherlands has grown and expanded its employment opportunities. The timely response of alternatives for employment <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the progressive policies the Netherlands has in place to complement the changes in industry. An example might include tax breaks for families where the father works full-time and the mother works part-time, also referred to as the [...] "one-and-a-half breadwinner" [...] policy.|$|R
