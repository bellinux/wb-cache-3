5|$|Until 1991, A.viridimontanum was grouped {{with the}} western <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> A.aleuticum, which grows both in western North America and as a disjunct on {{serpentine}} outcrops in eastern North America. At one time, A.aleuticum itself was classified as a variety (A.pedatum var. aleuticum) of the northern <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> A.pedatum. However, {{after several years of}} study, botanist Cathy Paris recognized that A.aleuticum was a distinct species, and that some of the specimens that had been attributed to that taxon (group of organisms) were a third, hybrid species intermediate between A.pedatum and A.aleuticum. She named the new species A.viridimontanum for the site of its discovery in the Green Mountains in Vermont; it has since been located in Quebec and in one site on serpentine in coastal Maine.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|The {{work which}} led to the {{recognition}} of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> then classified as A.pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified in Vermont by L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A.pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A.pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern in Vermont were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state.|$|E

500|$|Adiantum viridimontanum, {{commonly}} known as Green Mountain <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> is a rare fern found only in outcrops of serpentine rock in New England and Eastern Canada. The leaf blade is cut into finger-like segments, themselves once-divided, which are borne on the outer side of a curved, dark, glossy rachis (the central stalk of the leaf). These finger-like segments are not individual leaves, but parts of a single compound leaf. The [...] "fingers" [...] may be drooping or erect, {{depending on whether the}} individual fern grows in shade or sunlight. Spores are borne under false indusia (rolled flaps of tissue) {{at the edge of the}} subdivisions of the leaf, a characteristic unique to the genus Adiantum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaves are}} unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins {{radiating}} {{out into the}} leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network. Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; {{this is known as}} dichotomous venation. The leaves are usually , but sometimes up to [...] long. The old popular name [...] "maidenhair tree" [...] is because the leaves resemble some of the pinnae of the <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> Adiantum capillus-veneris. Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep saffron yellow.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{plants such}} as <b>maidenhair</b> <b>ferns,</b> wild rhododendrons, and vanilla leaf are {{abundant}} in the area. Wildflowers such as Columbia lilies, trilliums, and bleeding hearts grow in the spring.

50|$|Historically, {{certain of}} the <b>maidenhair</b> <b>ferns,</b> such as Adiantum pedatum, have been {{described}} as having a pedate leaf architecture, with a forked rachis which bears subdivided pinnae along the outer edge of its two outward- and backward-curving branches. However, a forking (dichotomizing) rachis is not characteristic of any other members of the Polypodiaceae. A more accurate description of such leaves was put forth by Margaret Slosson in 1906, and improved upon by Herb Wagner in the 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|The {{species was}} {{initially}} described by Carl Linnaeus in 1771, the specific epithet biloba {{derived from the}} Latin bis, [...] "two" [...] and loba, [...] "lobed", referring {{to the shape of}} the leaves. Two names for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury, a placement by Nelson as Pterophyllus salisburiensis and the earlier Salisburia adiantifolia proposed by James Edward Smith.

2500|$|Arkansas's {{plant life}} varies with its climate and elevation. The pine belt {{stretching}} from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region. In eastern Arkansas, one can find Taxodium [...] (cypress), Quercus nigra (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south. Nearby Crowley's Ridge is only home of the tulip tree in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the beech tree. The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with Ozark white cedars, cornus (dogwoods), and Cercis canadensis (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the Woodsia scopulina and Adiantum (<b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern)</b> on Mount Magazine.|$|E

Some way off stood a long, low house propped up against the rich yellow stone walls and pillars of another old, old building, and with a great chestnut-tree shadowing it. It had a balcony, and the gable end was open, and full of big yellow pumpkins and clusters of grapes hung up to dry; and some goats were feeding round.|$|E

60|$|Down the wide, {{creaking}} {{stairs and}} out upon the door-stone she went, pausing {{there for a}} moment to decide where first to go. The sound of some one singing {{in the rear of the}} house led her in that direction, and turning the corner she made her first pleasant discovery. A hill rose steeply behind the farm-house, and leaning from the bank was an old apple-tree, shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks and dropped into a mossy trough below.

Looking at this prostrate trunk, I saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that glowed red in the shadow; and then, almost in the same instant, made out what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the delicate green ferns.

From somewhere came the distant knocking of a woodpecker. This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place. Quiet woods, noises belonged there and made the solitude complete.
