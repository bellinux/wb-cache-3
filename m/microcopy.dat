40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} study of different ceramic matrix composites with high elastic losses and dispersion (porous piezoceramics, composites ceramics/crystals) were carried out. Complex sets of elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric parameters of the porous piezoceramics and ceramic matrix piezocomposites were determined by the impedance spectroscopy method using Piezoelectric Resonance Analysis software. Microstructure of polished and chipped surfaces of composite samples was observed with the optical and scanning electron <b>microcopies.</b> Experimental frequency dependencies of attenuation coefficients and ultrasonic velocities for different ceramic matrix composites were compared with the theoretical results obtained using general Kramers-Kronig relations between the ultrasonic attenuation and dispersion...|$|R

The mechanism of formation of iron oxides {{as a function}} of the amount of surfactant employed during the synthesis process was studied. Specifically Fe, Fe 2 O 3, and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were obtained. The oxidation of Fe to Fe 3 O 4 and finally to Fe 2 O 3 was carried out by oxidative etching process, decreasing the amount of stabilizer agent. The structures obtained were characterized by high resolution (HRTEM) and scanning/transmission (STEM) electron <b>microcopies,</b> energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis and IR) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNovel {{fluorinated}} reactive surfactants {{were used}} for the organic modification of monmorillonite clays. These organoclays {{were used for}} the preparation of polystyrene−clay nanocomposites by in-situ free radical polymerization. Reference systems based on hydrocarbon homologous surfmer and nonpolymerizable surfactants were also used to deduce the effect of the fluorine moiety and the polymerizable function on the morphology and thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. Different structural parameters of the surfactants were investigated and modulated for the clay modification including: the nature of surfactant (surfmer/classical surfactant, fluorinated, or hydrocarbonated), the length of the fluorinated chain as well as the length of the hydrocarbon spacers linking the ammonium head to the fluorine chain or the polymerizable acrylic function. Wide angle-X-ray scattering (WAXD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and electronic <b>microcopies</b> (TEM and SEM) were used to establish a structure-morphology, thermal properties relationships, and to highlight the key parameters governing the exfoliation process...|$|R
