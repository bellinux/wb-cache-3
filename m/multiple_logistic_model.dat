There {{is a need}} to develop rapid assessment of bacterial water quality. To this end many statistical models have been published mostly using-environmental variables to predict concentrations of a particular FIO. The majority of these statistical models have used Multiple Least squares regression in which the major indicator of the goodness of fit of these models have largely depended on the R 2 value, which to date have been quite low. Since Beach management decisions have to be dichotomous in nature (Open/Close Beach) we explored the use of the <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>model</b> in relation to the Multiple Lease Squares approach. Methods. 668 samples were utilized in this analysis. 10 major environmental variables and several FIO’s were collected on each sample date. Both types of models were run on these data. Results. Our Best Multiple Least Squares Regression was computed with a R Square value of 0. 26, while the Multiple Logistic Regression Model yielded a maximum Sensitivity of 72. 9 % and a maximum Specificity of 65. 9 % at a cut point = 0. 1. A backward selection routine was used in both the Logistic and Least Squares Model. Conclusion.

The measure {{used to assess}} the two models was R 2, which was defined for this study as the squared correlation coefficient between the predicted outcome measure and the actual binary outcome measure. Each sample contained 50 "subjects" with one binary outcome measure and four continuous predictor variables. The predictor variables were transformed into variables with normal and u-shape distribution properties. There were 129 data sets with normal distributions and 121 data sets with u-shape distributions which were analyzed. A known population correlation matrix was used to correlate each data set. Regression coefficients and R 2 values were calculated for the original 129 normal and 121 u-shape data sets using a multiple linear and a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> regression <b>model.</b> The obtained regression coefficients were then applied to cross-validation samples yielding another set of R 2 values. The <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> regression <b>model</b> had significantly larger R 2 values for both normal and u-shape distributions when the original data sets were evaluated.

40|$|Objective—To {{examine the}} {{clinical}} and epidemiological {{utility of the}} concepts of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance syndrome in two prospective cohort studies of white men.  Methods—Men aged 45 - 63 years were screened for evidence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) between 1979  and 1982  and followed up at regular intervals thereafter. Non-fatal coronary events were validated from hospital records and fatal coronary events from death certificates.  Results—Analysis of serum insulin concentrations in non-diabetic individuals measured at entry to the study showed no independent contribution {{to the prediction of}} subsequent IHD at 10  year follow up. Blood glucose concentrations, however, showed a small independent contribution in the combined cohort in the upper fifth of the distribution. Three different models of metabolic syndrome among non-diabetic individuals were defined based on tertiles, medians, and clusters. The predictive value of each model was assessed using logistic regression before and after adjustment for conventional and metabolic risk factors. After adjustment the odds were non-significant and close to unity.  Conclusions—This study did not detect any complex relation among the five variables defining metabolic syndrome; the excess risk seems to be no greater than can be explained by individual effects of the defining variables in a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>model.</b>    Keywords: metabolic syndrome;  insulin resistance;  screening;  ischaemic heart disease;  epidemiolog...|$|E

The subjects studied were 105 patients with solitary gastric varices. Sixty-seven {{of them were}} treated with EIS and 38 were observed without EIS. The sclerosant, 5 % ethanolamine oleate containing Iopamidol, was directly injected to the varices under X-ray monitoring. The author developed techniques to improve retention of the sclerosant and to minimize bleeding at the puncture site. Efficacy of EIS could be evaluated 1 to 3 months later in 61 cases. The gastric varices disappeared by the EIS in 40 of 61 patients (65. 6 %) and did not change in only 1 patient. In patients with bleeding varices, rate of hemostasis was higher and cumulative rates of re-bleeding, bleeding deaths and mortality rate were lower in patients with EIS than those with conservative treatment. In patients with non- bleeding F₂ and F₃ varices, cumulative rates of bleeding, bleeding deaths and mortality rate were also lower in patients with EIS than those with conservative treatment. Multivariate analysis by the <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>model</b> revealed that high Child grading, loss of EIS and bleeding on admission were significant factors for poor prognosis indicating bleeding and death within 1 year. Angiography showed that the varices and feeding vessels disappeared in almost all cases, but the drainage vessels were left in half the cases after EIS. As complications, mild shock, pleural effusion and ascites were observed in a few cases. No other serious complications were observed.

Triage decisions were recorded, and patient outcomes of AMI and other final diagnoses were determined for all patients. DATA COLLECTION METHODS. Clinical data were recorded by the physicians in the ED {{as part of a}} detailed protocol. Insurance data were recorded separately by the ED staff as part of the hospital administrative database. Patient outcomes were recorded daily by research nurses for hospitalized patients; for patients who were discharged from the ED, telephone or physician follow-up was accomplished within seven days after discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. HMO patients {{were more likely to be}} admitted to the hospital than patients in other insurance groups in both the medium- and low-risk patient categories. Within the low-risk category, after controlling for clinical differences in a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>model,</b> HMO membership retained an independent positive association with hospital admission compared to all other insurance groups except Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS. For patients with acute chest pain who were at medium and low risk of acute myocardial infarction, HMO membership was associated with higher rates of hospital admission. These findings suggest that organizational factors beyond financial incentives may exercise an important influence on hospitalization rates for HMO patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} how simple and <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> {{regression}} {{can be used}} in observational methodology and more specifically, in the fields of physical activity and sport. We demonstrate this in a study designed to determine whether three-a-side futsal or five-a-side futsal is more suited to the needs and potential of children aged 6 -to- 8 years. We constructed a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> regression <b>model</b> to analyze use of space (depth of play) and three simple <b>logistic</b> regression <b>models</b> to determine which game format is more likely to potentiate effective technical and tactical performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of socioeconomic status with {{the risk of}} death from ischaemic heart disease and any disease as well as the risk of cerebral stroke and any cancer was studied in 3644 men aged 30 - 59, based on a random sample from the population of eastern Finland. Age, smoking, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol concentration were allowed for in <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>models.</b> On the basis of these data, not being married, short education, and low income are associated with an excessive risk of death from ischaemic heart disease and any disease. The data also indicated that men who were not married and who lived in urban areas might have an increased risk of cerebral stroke and those with a short education an increased risk of cancer...|$|R
