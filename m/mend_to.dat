50|$|In 2004, {{the museum}} {{embarked}} on a project of surveys in Syria's (Homs District). The project was a partnership of the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria, the Mila and Fontanals Institution of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (Barcelona) and the International Institute for Prehistoric Research in the University of Cantabria (Santander). Scientific direction was carried out jointly by Dr. Michel Al-Maqdisi (Directorate of Antiquities and Museums of Syria), Dr. Maya Haïdar-Boustani (Museum Lebanese Prehistory, LSU) and Dr. Juan José Ibañez (Mila and Fontanals Institution). The area of the survey is located in western Syria, totaling approximately 560 km. This region includes clearly differentiated areas in {{the valley of the}} Orontes, the basaltic plateaus, hills and plains of Bouqaia. The aim of the mission is not only to inventory and document all sites from the Paleolithic to the Ottoman period, but specifically to locate sites that mark the beginning of the Neolithic and later those of Early Bronze Age lying between the south of Aleppo and the Beqaa valley, forming a vast region that connects the middle Euphrates to the Jordan Valley. The second area of research concerns the period of the mid 3rd millennium, including surveys to find sites on the caravan route between Tell Jamous in the west and Tell Nebi <b>Mend</b> <b>to</b> the east. The location of archaeological sites is based on analysis of satellite images (Corona and Google Earth), the study of the topographical maps, aerial photography, geophysical and population surveys. 167 archaeological sites were found from all periods, reflecting the rich heritage of this region. The major contribution of the work was the discovery of Natufian and megalithic tombs attested in two sites: Jeftelik and Wadi Chbat, the first Natufian sites inventoried and documented in this area. The Neolithic and perhaps even the final PPNB pottery was documented on a few important sites such as Tell al-Marj, which has strong parallels with Byblos. Megalithic sites are a spectacular phenomenon, often equipped with tumuli and burial vaults. These structures are sometimes grouped in small numbers, as on the tops of hills in the basaltic area, but sometimes they form a vast necropolis such as the basalt plains north of Lake Qattina. The presence of monoliths, and side walls of the tumuli suggests the existence of complex, Bronze Age, ritual structures similar to those of Menger in northern Lebanon and those of southern Syria.|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{developed}} a multifunctional envelope-type nano device (MEND) for efficient delivery of nucleic acids. For tumor delivery of a MEND, PEGylation is a useful method, which confers a longer systemic circulation and tumor accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, PEGylation inhibits cellular uptake and subsequent endosomal escape. To overcome this, {{we developed}} a PEG-peptide-DOPE (PPD) that is cleaved in a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -rich environment. In this study, {{we report on the}} systemic delivery of siRNA to tumors by employing a MEND that is modified with PPD (PPD-MEND). An in vitro study revealed that PPD modification accelerated both cellular uptake and endosomal escape, compared to a conventional PEG modified <b>MEND.</b> <b>To</b> balance both systemic stability and efficient activity, PPD-MEND was further co-modified with PEG-DSPE. As a result, the systemic administration of the optimized PPD-MEND resulted in an approximately 70 % silencing activity in tumors, compared to non-treatment. Finally, a safety evaluation showed that the PPD-MEND showed no hepatotoxicity and innate immune stimulation. Furthermore, in a DNA microarray analysis in liver and spleen tissue, less gene alternation was found for the PPD-MEND compared to that for the PEG-unmodified MEND due to less accumulation in liver and spleen...|$|E
40|$|Gene and {{nucleic acid}} therapy is {{expected}} {{to play a major}} role in the next generation of agents for cancer treatment. We have recently developed a multifunctional envelope-type nano device (MEND) for use as a novel nonviral gene delivery system. The modification of polyethyleneglycol (PEG), i. e., PEGylation, is a useful method for achieving a longer circulation time for the delivery of <b>MEND</b> <b>to</b> a tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, PEGylation strongly inhibits cellular uptake and endosomal escape, which results in significant loss of activity of the delivery system. For successful nucleic acid delivery for cancer treatment, the crucial problem associated with the use of PEG, i. e., the "PEG dilemma" must be resolved. In this review, we describe the development and applications of MEND and discuss various strategies for overcoming the PEG dilemma based on the manipulation of both pharmacokinetics and intracellular trafficking of cellular uptake and endosomal release. To increase cellular uptake, target ligands including proteins, peptides, antibodies and aptamers that recognize molecules specifically expressed on tumors are first introduced. Second, cleavable PEG systems are described. The cleavage of PEG from carriers was achieved in response to the intracellular environment as well as the tumor microenvironment, which improvs cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Then, endosomal fusogenic peptides are discussed. Finally, pH-sensitive liposomes using pH-sensitive lipids are described...|$|E
40|$|A large {{fraction}} of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells occurs without adaptors or dynamins. Here, we present {{evidence for the}} involvement of lipid domains in massive endocytosis (MEND) activated by both large Ca transients and amphipathic compounds in baby hamster kidney and HEK 293 cells. First, we demonstrate functional coupling of the two MEND types. Ca transients can strongly facilitate detergent-activated MEND. Conversely, an amphipath with dual alkyl chains, ditridecylphthalate, is without effect {{in the absence of}} Ca transients but induces <b>MEND</b> <b>to</b> occur within seconds during Ca transients. Ca transients, like amphipaths, enhance the extraction of lipids from cells by β-cyclodextrins. Second, we demonstrate that electrical and/or optical signals generated by selected membrane probes are nearly insensitive to MEND, suggesting that those probes segregate into membrane domains that are not taken up by MEND. Triphenylphosphoniums are increasingly excluded from domains that internalize as the carbon chain length increases from 4 to 12. The small cationic membrane dye, FM 4 – 64, binds well to domains that internalize, whereas a closely related dye with a larger hydrophobic moiety, di- 4 -ANEPPDHQ (ANEPPDHQ) is excluded. Multiple carrier-type ionophores and a small amphipathic anion, niflumic acid, are also excluded. Probes with modest MEND sensitivity include the hydrophobic anion, dipicrylamine, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine. Third, we demonstrate that large Ca transients can strongly enhance the extracellular binding of several membrane probes, monitored electrically or optically, consistent with a more disordered membrane with more amphipath-binding sites. Fluorescence shifts of ANEPPDHQ report increased disorder of the extracellular monolayer after large Ca transients, consistent with an increased propensity of the membrane to phase separate and vesiculate. Collectively, the results indicate that > 50 % of the outer monolayer is ordered and can be selectively internalized during MEND responses initiated by two very different cell perturbations...|$|E
