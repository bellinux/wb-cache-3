25|$|The Donetsk coal was {{necessary}} for smelting pig-iron from the Kryvyi Rih ore, producing {{a need for a}} railway to connect Yozovka with Kryvyi Rih. Permission to build the railway was given in 1881, and it opened in 1884. The railway crossed the Dnieper at Ekaterinoslav. The city grew quickly; new suburbs appeared: Amur, Nyzhnodniprovsk and the factory areas developed. In 1897, Ekaterinoslav became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams.

25|$|The {{president}} of Gran-Colombia, the liberator Simón Bolívar, decided to contract European scientists {{to investigate the}} available sources of his new formed nation, and to push with {{that the development of}} natural sciences and mining technology in South America at all. Bolivar's main target of that project was to develop the economy of the young nation. The minister of Gran-Colombia in Paris, Francisco Antonio Zea, contracted Mariano Eduardo in May 1822, who had been highly recommended by Alexander von Humboldt, to found and to manage a <b>mining</b> <b>school</b> in Bogotá together with a group of young European scientists. Therefore, Mariano Eduardo made the necessary trip preparation. He bought some laboratory equipment and ordered constructions of precisions instruments for certain measurements.|$|E

25|$|Mariano Eduardo {{returned}} to South America and arrived in November 1822 at La Guaira, Venezuela with the French chemist Jean Baptiste Boussingault. They studied in Venezuela the thermal springs of Mariara and Onoto, {{the exploitation of}} mineral salts in Urao Lake and the secretion of the cow-tree (this tree produces drinkable milk) and he also made barometric observations. They left Venezuela and arrived in Bogotá, Colombia, in May 1823 where encounterd with general Bolivar. He inaugurated in Bogotá a {{museum of natural history}} and a <b>mining</b> <b>school</b> in November 1823 as its first director. Mariano Eduardo and his scientific group did expeditions to the orient plain of Colombia.

25|$|Advances {{in science}} and {{technology}} brought on by World War II, and continued Canadian industrialization, previously interrupted by the Great Depression, created a demand for a more highly trained population. Howard Hillen Kerr was given control of nine Ontario Training and Re-establishment centres to accomplish this. His vision of what these institutions would do was broader than what others were suggesting. In 1943, he visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was convinced Canada could develop its own MIT over one hundred years. Along the way, such an institution could respond to the society's needs. When the Province approved the idea of technical institutes in 1946, it proposed to found several. It turned out all but one would be special purpose schools, such as the <b>mining</b> <b>school.</b> Only the Toronto retraining centre, which became the Ryerson Institute of Technology in 1948, would become a multi-program campus, Kerr’s future MIT of Canada. This vision is reflected in Ryerson's Motto and its mission statement.|$|E
25|$|Watermanship {{being one}} of the many skills {{required}} of the Sapper {{led to the formation of}} a sailing club at the School of Military Engineering in 1812 and later to the development of cutter rowing teams. Construction of a canal linking Thames and Medway rivers in 1824 gave the Royal Engineers an inland waterway to practice these skills, with the officer responsible for the canal drawn from the Royal Engineers Regiment. In 1899 as General Officer Commanding the Thames and Medway Canal, General Sir Charles Warren presented a challenge shield for a championship cutter race on the River Medway against the Royal Navy. The Sapper teams were drawn from members of the Submarine <b>Mining</b> <b>School,</b> but when the service was disbanded in 1905, the tradition of cutter rowing was continued by the fieldwork squads. The REYC continues to compete against the Royal Navy Sailing Association annually to this day. The club developed and became the Royal Engineer Yacht Club in 1846, making it one of the most senior yacht clubs in the United Kingdom. The REYC continues to this day, operating three club yachts and competing on behalf of the Corps at races around the world. The club is one of the oldest sports clubs in the British Army.|$|E

25|$|The first higher {{education}} institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian {{higher education}} institution was the Ostrozka School, or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European {{higher education institutions}} of the time. Established in 1576 {{in the town of}} Ostrog, the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the Eastern Slavic territories. The oldest university was the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of Imperial Russia as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the Lviv University, founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in Kharkiv (1805), Kiev (1834), Odessa (1865) and Chernivtsi (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a Technological Institute (1885) in Kharkiv, a Polytechnic Institute in Kiev (1898) and a Higher <b>Mining</b> <b>School</b> (1899) in Katerynoslav. Rapid growth followed in the Soviet period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students. Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations.|$|E
25|$|After the Alvord mine in California was {{destroyed}} in a fire, Burnham stayed in California until 1894 to wrap up his family's affairs with the mine and left for the South African Republic {{as soon as he}} could to join his brother Fred already in Bulawayo, Matabeleland. He soon found work as a mining engineer and {{was in charge of the}} assay laboratory and smelting room at the Langlaagte Royal Mine in the Transvaal. In 1895, he was preparing to accompany his brother in a massive expedition into Northern Rhodesia when he took ill and was forced to leave for Europe to recuperate. He left for Germany accompanied by his nephew Roderick, and the two of them then went to London, England. In 1895, he married his first wife Margaret. He returned to the United States and from 1896-1898 attended the Michigan <b>Mining</b> <b>School</b> (now Michigan Technological University), graduating with an S.B. By September 1898, he and his wife were back in Africa and he was working for an English syndicate and supervising over 2,000 miners at the Rosa deep gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa. While in the Transvaal, Burnham was a chief chemist, an engineer, and an assistant inspector for mines, and he wrote a textbook: Modern Mine Valuation.|$|E
25|$|His {{return to}} the Americas also {{occurred}} {{under the tutelage of}} Humboldt. In 1822, Francisco Antonio Zea delivered a Simon Bolívar's letter to Humboldt. There Bolívar asked Humboldt to send a scientific mission to both investigate the natural resources of the new Republic of the Gran Colombia and to establish a museum of natural history as well as a <b>mining</b> <b>school.</b> The German scholar, who saw Rivero as a prominent disciple, named him head of the mission. After three years in which he maintained a constant correspondence with his European colleagues, Rivero left Colombia {{because of a lack of}} economic and political support. Bolívar then recommended his recruitment to the Peruvian government for the development of similar projects. From 1826 onwards, Rivero undertook several enterprises in his home country: he fostered a scientific journal, founded the first National Museum, created the School of Mines, served as prefect in mining regions, published extensively on mineral resources, and wrote the first antiquarian study of postcolonial Peru: Antigüedades peruanas. This book was published in Vienna in 1851 upon his return to Europe and was translated into English, French, and German soon after. Reinserted in the European academic world, he gave several talks on Peruvian resources and antiquities until he died in Paris in 1857, directly after publishing a collection of his scientific memoirs in Brussels.|$|E

25|$|On April 16, 1913, SB 183 {{was signed}} by the Texas {{governor}} allocating funding for a new institution, making it the second oldest academic institution in the University of Texas system. The school officially opened on September 28, 1914, with 27 students in buildings belonging to the former El Paso Military Institute on a site just adjacent to Fort Bliss on the Lenoria Mesa. By 1916, enrollment had grown to 39 students, including its first two female students, Ruth Brown and Grace Odell. On October 29, 1916, a devastating fire destroyed the main building of the school, prompting its relocation. In 1917, the new school facility was constructed on its present site above Mundy Heights, with the land donated by several El Paso residents. In a period when United States architects were designing in styles adopted especially from Europe, Kathleen Worrell, wife of the university's dean, was attracted by photographs of the Kingdom of Bhutan in a 1914 issue of National Geographic magazine, which showed the dzong architecture style of its Buddhist monasteries. The resemblances between the local terrain and mountainous features of Bhutan inspired her to propose designing early buildings of the <b>mining</b> <b>school</b> in the dzong style. Liking its distinctiveness, administrations have continued to choose that style for additional facilities, including the Sun Bowl football stadium and parking garages. Dzong (fortified religious and administrative centers) has characteristics such as sloping sides, markedly overhanging roofs, and bands of colored decoration.|$|E

50|$|Another {{significant}} mining-related building, which reflected Cowdenbeath's growing status at {{the forefront}} of mining technology, was the establishment of the Fife <b>Mining</b> <b>School</b> in 1895. The school had humble origins, operating out of two rooms in Broad Street School, until it was transferred to the basement of Beath High School on Stenhouse Street. It was not until 1936 that Fife <b>Mining</b> <b>School</b> acquired its own custom-built building {{on the site of the}} old Woodside House on Broad Street. The new Fife <b>Mining</b> <b>School</b> was erected at a cost of £22,500, and was opened on 22 March by Ernest Brown, MP, then parliamentary secretary to the mines department. The school trained apprentices in all aspects of the mining trade; however, it did have a temporary change of use during both world wars, when it was used to train women working in the munitions industry. The <b>mining</b> <b>school</b> closed in 1976, reflecting the diminishing role of coal mining in the community.|$|E
