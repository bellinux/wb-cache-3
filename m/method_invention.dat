40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analyzing}} nonlinear and nonstationary data has been developed, {{and the natural}} applications are to speech and sound signals. The {{key part of the}} method is the Empirical Mode Decomposition method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). An IMF is defined as any function having the same numbers of zero-crossing and extrema, and also having symmetric envelopes defined by the local maxima and minima respectively. The IMF also admits well-behaved Hilbert transform. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and nonstationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the Intrinsic Mode Functions yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time, which give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. This <b>method</b> <b>invention</b> can be used to process all acoustic signals. Specifically, it can process the speech signals for Speech synthesis, Speaker identification and verification, Speech recognition, and Sound signal enhancement and filtering. Additionally, as the acoustical signals from machinery are essentially the way the machines are talking to us. Therefore, the acoustical signals, from the machines, either from sound through air or vibration on the machines, can tell us the operating conditions of the machines. Thus, we can use the acoustic signal to diagnosis the problems of machines...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for obtaining pulp {{which is used}} for production of cardboard, paper and package while using carbon dioxide and hydrazine hydrate and neutral-sulfite  shive cooking. Output increase of  the desired product {{can be explained by}} reduction in destruction of plant raw material carbohydrates during its cooking process. Quality improvement of the desired product (improvement in bleaching and output) is attributed to the fact that usage of carbon dioxide and hydrazine contributes to provision of polysaccharide chain resistance to destruction due to the presence of  end links having structure of metasaccharinic and aldonic acids. The author has developed a new method for pulp obtaining {{on the basis of the}} executed investigations  and literature data.   СО 2 and hydrazine hydrate have been used for obtaining pulp. <b>Method</b> <b>invention</b> concerns pulp obtaining and it can be used for paper and cardboard package manufacturing in pulp and paper industry. The method is to be carried in the following way: pulp-containing plant raw material is loaded into an autoclave and then aqua solution of sodium monosulfite containing hydrazine hydrate that constitutes 4 – 5 % of absolute dry pulp-containing raw material mass with liquid module 1 : 6 – 1 : 8 is supplied into the autoclave. The autoclave is closed for operation under pressure and the solution is carbonated under pressure which constitutes 5 – 8 % of absolute dry plant raw material (shover). Temperature is subsequently raised up to 180 °С in the space of 2 hours and cooking is carried out in the course of 4 hours. Usage of  the proposed method for shover cooking makes it possible to reduce monosulfite cooking process and improve qualitative characteristics and output of the desired product.   In addition to above mentioned fact there is a possibility to improve bleaching and final product output.  </p...|$|E

The faults in these systems are unwanted and the drive system must be operated under the fault conditions. If fault occurs this may be lead to loss of the human life and capital so the detection of this fault, separation the faulty part and <b>method</b> <b>invention</b> for remedial operation is very important. In this paper the performance of a permanent magnet synchronous motor drive under a stator winding fault is studied and a negative sequence is used to detect the different types of the faults in that winding. This paper is suggested two models for solving these faults. The control in these models depends upon the controlling in each phase separately.

In the process of transition towards democratization in Indonesia, as one of the pillars of democracy, which is important in the era of freedom of the press at this time is not a 'freedom from' (freedom from absolutisme), authoritarian power, as the New Orde Era through application the SIUPP (License Effort Publication of Press). About the values freedom of the press itself, it has been accomodated in the 1945 Constitution that has been amendemend, which is arranged in Section 28, Section 28 E Sentence (2) and (3) also Section 28 F. However, the need to realize that the man the press keep ordinary citizens are bowing to the applicable law in Indonesia. Formulation of the problem in this research are: (1) What is the verdict of the indictment prosecutors canceled for the law or decision of Niet Ontvankelijk Verklaring is right? (2) What if the case is Magazine Playboy of Indonesia judged after released of Law No. 44 Year 2008 about Pornography? The method used in this research is a method approach of normative juridical. Technique Gathering of Materials Law, authors use the techniques of literature. Analysis Materials Law, in analyzing the Law of Normative, the author using analysis technique fill according (sincronation analysis) and descriptive analysis of qualitative data, namely by giving interpretations of the data obtained are rational and objective, which is arranged, grouped and sorted with using the code and categorize, and then describes the relationship between the variables with each other in order to describe the phenomena in more concrete and detailed, and also performed with the use of identification which was then systematically carried out with the elaborating/descriptive comprehensive qualitative. Based on the results of the research results obtained as follows : before the Pornography Law decision, ceremony judge decision based on the Press Law the judge to distinguish between purely criminal matter with the criminal case involving the journalistic product. So be free because in the Press Law responsibility the press can only be charged to the company or corporation that sanction just fine. Not sanctioned prison to journalists and editor leaders. Conclusion from the description above, {{it is clear that the}} judge is required in the quality of cut off cases. There is an adagium saying that "law is always behind the times compared with the development community," result of a legal vacuum, in the travel time. It was felt more in the era of reform and transformation in this now. Meanwhile, the issues of law (disputes) in the community continue, the settlement of legal claim, through the judicial process. To fill the vacuum of law, the Judges needed a quality, that are able to participate in the discovery of the law. For that, a judge must have the stock of knowledge and thinking as a process that has been described in this paper. If only, all Judges have the quality that way, then every decision (yurisprundention) will be able to colour every development of the law in this country. So, the problems fundamental who was appointed in this paper, have been answered, that is : that the judge cut off in the matter must always fill the vacuum of law using : Law Norm, Science Law, Legal Theory, and Philosophy Law (<b>Method</b> <b>Invention</b> of Law), as described in this article...|$|E
