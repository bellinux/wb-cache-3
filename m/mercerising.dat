50|$|<b>Mercerised</b> pulp is a {{bleached}} pulp that is treated with hot diluted alkali to get extra high bulk and high porosity. The pulp feels and looks {{similar to a}} cotton ball.|$|R
5000|$|Coverings {{have changed}} as {{industrial}} techniques have developed, and have included <b>Mercerised</b> cotton, velvet, calfskin and, most recently, bicast leather. However, sheep's leather {{is still considered}} the authentic material for the chairs.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{wood fibre}} {{reinforced}} polypropylene composites at a wood fibre content of 50 wt. % are prepared using {{different types of}} wood fibres (beech wood refiner fibre, <b>mercerised</b> beech wood refiner fibre, <b>mercerised</b> and bleached beech wood refiner fibre as well as beech wood chips, <b>mercerised</b> beech wood chips, <b>mercerised</b> and bleached beech wood chips) to improve the impact resistance of the final composite. Additionally a beech wood refiner fibre-PP composite {{as well as a}} beech wood chip-PP composite are mixed with regenerated cellulosic fibres (5 wt. % and 10 wt. %) to further enhance the impact resistance. To increase the interfacial adhesion with the matrix and to improve the dispersion of particles two different coupling agents with contents from 2 wt. % to 8 wt. % are tested with two wood plastic composites (WPC). One is made of beech wood refiner fibres and the other one is produced from beech wood chips. The present study investigated Charpy impact property of wood fibres reinforced polypropylene as a function of fibre modification, content of regenerated cellulosic fibres and coupling agent. From the results it is observed that beech wood refiner fibre-PP composites show better Charpy impact properties than beech wood chips-PP composites. Charpy impact resistance is improved by mixing regenerated cellulose fibres (RCF) and RCF-PP-granule with beech wood refiner fibres and chips. The maximum increase in impact resistance is two times for refiner fibres and 10 % RCF-PP-granule respectively three and a half times for chips and 10 % RCF-PP-granule. By adding coupling agent Charpy impact resistance is nearly doubled for all wood fibre-PP composites...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} impart the {{required}} functional properties to the fiber or fabric, it is customary to subject {{the material to}} different types of physical and chemical treatments. For example, wash and wear finish for a cotton fabric is necessary to make it -free or wrinkle-free. In a similar way, <b>mercerising,</b> singeing, flame retardant, water repellent, waterproof, anti-static and peach finishing achieve various fabric properties desired by consumers.|$|E

It also has computerised data colour system, gas chromatography and mass spectrometer, light fastness and other quality control equipment required to ensure high quality dyeing and finishing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mercerising</b> {{results in}} the {{swelling}} of the cell wall of the cotton fibre. This causes {{an increase in the}} surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel. An optional last step in the process is passing the thread over an open flame, or singeing. This incinerates stray fibers, improving the fabric's appearance. This is known as [...] "gassing the thread" [...] because of the gas burner that is typically used.|$|E
5000|$|The modern {{production}} method for <b>mercerised</b> cotton, {{also known as}} [...] "pearl" [...] or [...] "pearle" [...] cotton, gives cotton thread (or cotton-covered thread with a polyester core) a sodium hydroxide bath that is then neutralized with an acid bath. This treatment increases lustre, strength, affinity to dye, and resistance to mildew. On the other hand, it also increases its affinity to lint.|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of alkali treatment on the mechanical properties of banana fibre (Musa Paradisiaca). Fibres were extracted from the pseudostem by a defibring machine; they were <b>mercerised</b> and modified by 5 % NaOH (w/v) alkali treatment. Morphological characterisation showed that treated fibres’ surface was rougher than that of untreated fibres. Mechanical characterisation indicated that Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength and strain became decreased by increasing both treated and untreated fibres’ diameter. </span...|$|R
50|$|The raw {{materials}} are different paper pulps. The pulp may be from softwood, hardwood, fiber crops, mineral fibers. For high quality filters, dissolving pulp and <b>mercerised</b> pulp are used. Most filter papers {{are made on}} small paper machines. For laboratory filters the machines may be as small as 50 cm width. The paper is often crêped to improve porosity. The filter papers may also be treated with reagents or impregnation {{to get the right}} properties.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{in use in}} 1850. It was reconfigured in 1893. It was driven by a {{condensing}} stationary steam engine which required a reservoir or mill lodge to contain water to condense the steam; this was filled in the 1970s. The mill {{took advantage of the}} copious soft water to engage in finishing yarn or fabric. The processes involved bleaching, <b>mercerising</b> and dyeing.The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914-1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonys to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Ainsworth Mill, Breightmet was one of 104 mills bought last by the LCC. It one of the 53 mills that LCC owned in 1950, and was extensively refurbished to provide a <b>mercerising</b> facility. They established a research and quality control laboratory here to service the group and ensure the stability of the colour. Yarn was received from other mills in the group in warp or in hank, and is mercerised, bleached and dyed, then wrapped into hank, cone, quiller pirn, back beam, weaver's beam, cheese or precision wound multiple end cheese as required. On LCC demise, Ainsworth Mill continued in business as a bleaching and dyeing work until the dyeing company that went into liquidation in 2006. The works is derelict, but surveys have been done showing an intention to bring the mill back into industrial use.|$|E

40|$|The {{finishing}} {{process is a}} major energy-consuming procedure in the textile industry because it uses {{a large amount of}} thermal energy in the form of steam and heat. This study conducts energetic and exergetic analyses on the {{finishing process}} in cotton textile production based on actual operational data. Energy and exergy efficiencies are determined to assess their performance and formulate strategies for improvements. The lowest energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained in singeing. The largest irreversibility is associated with the hot oil boiler, followed by washing in <b>mercerising</b> and washing II in desizing. The greatest energy losses are linked to washing in <b>mercerising</b> and stenter. As such, immediate efforts to improve the process should be focused on these procedures. Most of the thermal energy consumed in the process ends up as waste heat. Technologies of reusing waste heat for water heating should, therefore, be developed...|$|E
50|$|Since silk, the {{original}} product, was gradually {{being replaced by}} more modern raw materials, Amann & Söhne started to manufacture schappe silk in 1919, and <b>mercerised</b> cotton in 1923. Alfred Amann died in 1942. Alfred Pielenz, his son-in-law, was nominated to become his successor. He guided the company through {{the last years of}} war, during which the production stagnated, as well as through the postwar years, during which the production was slowly being reconstructed.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{studying}} {{the reign of}} James IV believe that a similar series of [...] "Unicorn" [...] tapestries {{were part of the}} Scottish Royal tapestry collection. The team at West Dean Tapestry visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to inspect the originals and researched the medieval techniques, the colour palette and materials. Traditional techniques and materials were used with <b>mercerised</b> cotton taking the place of silk to preserve its colour better. The wool was specially dyed at West Dean College.|$|R
50|$|Ethnic and {{regional}} weaves and patterns are plenty and popular. There are Rakhine longyi, Mon longyi, Kachin longyi, Inle longyi, Zin Mè (Chiang Mai) longyi, Yaw longyi, Seik Hkun longyi, Dawei longyi and more. Silk pasos, {{but not a}} cheik, that men wear for special occasions are called bangauk (Bangkok) paso. Kala (Indian) paso are often longer and are worn by taller persons; Kaka zin refers to a broad check pattern of black, brown and white worn by Indian teashop owners. <b>Mercerised</b> longyis from India are still popular as the fabric is more durable.|$|R
40|$|In this study, five {{parameters}} of a <b>mercerising</b> machine, four {{parameters of}} untreated yarn and three {{parameters of the}} caustic soda bath affecting the tensile strength of mercerised yarn were investigated. Experiments were designed {{with the aid of}} the Response Surface Method. Accordingly different types of yarns were mercerised on different machines and with production settings, then relevant trends were studied. Results show that the strength of the mercerised yarn is highly affected by the cylinder normal pressure, warm rinsing tem-perature and caustic soda bath concentration, while the effect of the cold rinsing tempera-ture is observed only for higher qualities of cotton fibers and yarns. Increasing the cylinder rotation duration results in a reduction in the strength of carded yarns, but has little effect on combed yarns. Results also show that optimum settings are highly affected by the type of cotton fiber, yarn structure and number of plies, but the linear density of single yarn and the <b>mercerising</b> machine type have no significant effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} scouring, bleaching and <b>mercerising</b> {{of single}} jersey cotton knitted fabrics {{through the use}} of high-concentration NaOH was evaluated in this study. The effect of that new combined process was compared, contrasted and analysed with pristine scoured, bleached fabric and conventional bleached fabric. Surface morphology, structural analysis and the colour strength of dyed fabrics were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and spectrophotometric analysis. The barium activity number and bursting strength of treated fabric was evaluated and analysed in accordance with the relevant AATCC test standards. It was found that a sample treated through combined scouring, bleaching and <b>mercerising</b> demonstrated a higher level of smoothness and lustre than typical scoured and bleached fabric. The treated sample exhibited decreased crystallinity, as well as the transformation of the crystalline phase in a similar manner. The barium activity number, bursting strength and improved K/S value were also in line with the separately mercerised fabric. The above described properties of the combined scoured, bleached and mercerised fabric are sound evidence of the effectiveness of the process...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1920s, the American market {{has used the}} term {{broadcloth}} to describe a plain-woven, usually <b>mercerised</b> fabric woven with a rib and a slightly heavier filling yarn, used for shirt-making, made from cotton or a polyester-and-cotton blend [...] This fabric {{was introduced in the}} early 1920s as an import from the United Kingdom, where it was called poplin, but it was arbitrarily renamed broadcloth as it was thought that the British name had connotations of heaviness. Another version of this fabric, woven in rayon or polyester-and-rayon, is called fuji.|$|R
50|$|Jean Dollfus {{was born}} in Mulhouse, France, in 1800, the son of Daniel Dollfus and Anne Marie Mieg. He {{was born in}}to a family that owned a textile {{business}} established in the 18th century. His parents wrote their surname as Dollfus-Mieg, and Daniel used this name to re-brand his uncle's textile company as Dollfus-Mieg & Compagnie, or D.M.C., in 1800. Whilst studying in Leeds, Jean Dollfus found out about <b>Mercerised</b> cotton. This was a new technique of chemically treating cotton to increase not only its strength but also its appearance, a discovery that he would apply to the textile business.|$|R
50|$|The main {{application}} for air filters are combustion air to engines. The filter papers are transformed into filter cartridges, which then is fitted to a holder. The {{construction of the}} cartridges mostly requires that the paper is stiff enough to be self-supporting. A paper for air filters needs to be very porous and have a weight of 100 - 200 g/m2. Normally particularly long fibrous pulp that is <b>mercerised</b> is used to get these properties. The paper is normally impregnated to improve the resistance to moisture. Some heavy duty qualities are made to be rinsed and thereby {{extend the life of}} the filter.|$|R
40|$|Asbestos fibre {{has been}} used as {{traditional}} base material in brake pads manufacture, but due to its health hazard, non-renewability, cost, non-biodegradability and difficulty in processing, its replacement has been sought. For the purpose of improving their properties, the fibres were retted, bleached and modified using mercerization, acetylation and semi-carbonisation methods to obtain three modified fibres in addition to the crude fibre. The four fibre types (crude, <b>mercerised,</b> acetylated and semi-carbonised) were evaluated for moisture absorption, density and porosity. Brake pads were produced from each of the four fibre types (each 15 % by weight) using a randomised factorial experimental design (1 x 3 x 3), where the concentrations of th...|$|R
25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of warps and wefts {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (<b>mercerised)</b> cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|R
40|$|Continuous cold Ar plasmas {{were used}} to {{activate}} the <b>mercerised</b> cotton fabric towards surface-initiated graft polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylate, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrahydroperfluorodecyl methacrylate (XFDMA). Single and multi-step processes, carried out either in the plasma chamber (one-step and two-step processes) or ex situ after plasma treatment, were explored to optimise the grafting efficiency. The mechanical properties of the grafted cotton were substantially unaffected. Grafting with XFDMA gave good results only when the plasma activation was performed on monomer-impregnated fabrics, as shown by gravimetry, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, and water and oil repellence tests. On the contrary, with HEMA better results were obtained by in situ grafting from monomer vapour...|$|R
5000|$|Doubling is {{a textile}} {{industry}} term synonymous with combining. It {{can be used}} for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. [...] It is used for embroidery threads and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is <b>mercerised,</b> gassed (AKA flamed) and wound onto a bobbin.|$|R
50|$|The {{early years}} of the 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new artificial silk was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of schappe silk (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, <b>mercerised</b> cotton thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from artificial silk.|$|R
50|$|Today the Baandha {{fabric is}} popularly {{known by its}} {{geographical}} and cultural name Sambalpuri owing to the pioneering efforts of Sri Radhashyam Meher, who brought about a radical improvement in {{the skills of the}} craftsmen {{and the quality of the}} products. Other master craftsmen who contributed to the development of Sambalpuri textiles were Padmashree Kailash Chandra Meher, Padmashree Kunja Bihari Meher, Padmashree Chatrubhuja Meher and Padmashree Krutharth Acharya. Sambalpuri textiles today include furnishing materials, dress materials and sarees in silk, cotton and <b>mercerised</b> cotton in a variety of colours and many different designs. Baandha craftsmen are also masters of the 'extra warp' and 'extra weft' style of designing which can be seen in almost all forms of Baandha textiles. Radhashyam Meher also produced Khadi textiles using the Baandha art.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{ecological}} {{parameters of the}} effluent obtained from dyeing of scoured and <b>mercerised</b> organic cotton single jersey fabrics with textile reactive dyes adopting exhaust dyeing method was investigated. The dyes used include regular (Navacron H and FN) reactive dyes and low impact (Remazol and Levafix) reactive dyes along with inorganic salt (sodium sulphate) and biosalt (trisodium citrate). The ecological parameters include chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total dossolved solids (TDS). The {{results show that the}} use of the low impact reactive dyes has greater ecological advantages as it reduces the COD, BOD and TDS of the effluent considerably. Further, the use of the biosalt in the dye bath as replacement for the inorganic salt reduces the COD and TDS value significantly but will also increase the BOD of the effluent...|$|R
