50|$|<b>Magaldrate</b> is {{available}} in the form of oral suspension or tablets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magaldrate</b> (INN) is {{a common}} antacid drug that {{is used for the}} {{treatment}} of duodenal and gastric ulcers, esophagitis from gastroesophageal reflux.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magaldrate</b> is a hydroxymagnesium {{aluminate}} {{complex that}} is converted rapidly in gastric acid to Mg(OH)2 and Al(OH)3, which are absorbed poorly and thus provide a sustained antacid effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magaldrate</b> may {{negatively}} influence {{drugs like}} tetracyclines, benzodiazepines, and indomethacin. High doses or prolonged usage {{may lead to}} an increment of defecation {{and a reduction in}} feces consistence. In some cases it can alter the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract, occasionally provoking constipation or diarrhea.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to compare effects of sodium {{alginate}} and the antacid <b>magaldrate</b> anhydrous in adults with gastroesophageal reflux (GOR) symptoms. Patients with heartburn and/or acid regurgitation for at least 3 days in the week before the study started (n= 203) were randomized to receive a single dose of sodium alginate or <b>magaldrate</b> anhydrous at the onset of symptoms during a 3 -day run-in period. Patients with symptoms during the run-in (n= 191) were rerandomized to receive a 14 -day treatment with either drug given as four daily doses. A speed of action < or = 30 min was significantly more frequent among patients in the alginate group (49. 4 % vs. 40. 4 %; P= 0. 0074). A trend toward a more prolonged duration of action (median: 16. 5 vs. 12. 7 hr) and a greater sum of the symptom intensity difference (median: 40. 0 vs. 31. 0) was observed in the sodium alginate group. Total disappearance of symptoms was reported in 81. 6 % and 73. 9 % of patients in the sodium alginate group and <b>magaldrate</b> group, respectively. We conclude that sodium alginate was faster than <b>magaldrate</b> in relieving GRO symptoms and showed a tendency toward a more prolonged duration of action and a higher level of efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{compounds}} {{have been}} used in the healthcare setting for many years. Over-the-counter (OTC) products like mag-nesium oxides and magnesium hydroxides (<b>magaldrate,</b> Antiflux, Lowsium, Riopan) are used as antacids; magnesium salicylates (Doan’s pills, Magan, Mobidin) are used as non-narcotic analgesics; and magnesium salts (Milk of Magnesia) are used for consti-pation. 1 This article focuses on the more pro-gressive uses of intravenous magnesium sul-fate that are beginning to appear in prehos-pital care protocols and trial studies, specifi-cally for serious asthma and stroke. The more accepted use of magnesium fo...|$|E
40|$|The rate of gastric {{emptying}} of two antacids, <b>magaldrate</b> and Maalox, {{was investigated}} using scintigraphy. Successful labelling of the antacids {{was carried out}} with 99 mTc. The stability of the 99 mTc-labelled antacids was satisfactory {{and there was no}} difference in antacid capacity between the labelled and unlabelled antacids. The studies were carried out on 15 healthy male volunteers. After an eight hour fast each subject ingested a standardised meal of 95. 7 MJ (400 kcal). One hour later 10 ml of one of the two antacids previously labelled with 99 mTc was administered. Serial detection by anterior and posterior projection of the amount of antacid retained in the stomach was performed to determine gastric emptying of antacid. One week later the study was repeated under the same conditions with the other antacid also labelled with 99 mTc. The mean (SD) percentages of antacid retained in the stomach fit a linear model with a t 1 / 2 of 86. 6 (15. 3) minutes for <b>magaldrate</b> and 52. 3 (5. 2) minutes for Maalox (p less than 0. 01). When the mean percentages of retention at six time intervals were compared for both antacids, it was found that Maalox emptied much faster (p less than 0. 01 at 15 and 30 minutes, p less than 0. 02 at 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes) ...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{brands of}} antacid {{products}} {{available on the}} Kenya market were investigated for their acid neutralising capacity and sodium content. Thirteen tablet products gave neutralising capacity per tablet of between 4. 7 to 14. 12 mMol hydrochloric acid. The neutralising capacities for the suspensions ranged between 11. 97 to 34. 32 mMol hydrochloric acid for 10 ml suspension. The lowest neutralising capacities were obtained for products based on compound magnesium trisilicate and higher capacities for those containing <b>magaldrate,</b> or magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate {{in combination with other}} ingredients. The fastest rate of neutralization was obtained with preparations containing carbonates and the lowest by compound magnesium trisilicate. The sodium content for the preparations was between < 0. 001 mEq to 0. 732 mEq sodium per minimum recommended dose. The study shows a high degree of variation in both the acid neutralising capacities and the sodium content of the different brands investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antacid (AA) in a {{very low}} dose (88 mmol/day) was {{compared}} to the standard 800 -mg dose of cimetidine in healing duodenal ulcers. the influence of sex, age, symptom duration at entry, night pain, smoking, coffee consumption, and alcohol on ulcer healing was studied. the antacid was given in two different schedules: group I- 20 ml 1 hr after breakfast and at bedtime; group II- 10 ml 1 hr after breakfast and lunch and 20 ml at bedtime. Cimetidine (group III) was given in two divided doses: 400 mg 1 hr after breakfast and 400 mg at bedtime. Endoscopic control was performed after four weeks and, if necessary, after eight weeks of treatment. the healing rate after four weeks of treatment was, respectively, for groups I, II, and III, 45. 5 %, 55. 8 %, and 69. 4 % (group I = group II, and group III different from groups I and II). After eight weeks of treatment the healing rate was 61. 5 %, 80. 8 %, and 88. 0 % for groups I, II, and III, respectively (group II = group III, and group I different from groups II and III). Except for group I, smoking did not influence healing rate. Age sex, symptoms at entry, night pain, and coffee consumption did not influence the treatment results. the authors concluded that the very low dose of <b>magaldrate</b> (88 mmol/day), when administered in three divided doses (10 ml after breakfast and lunch and 20 ml at bedtime) for eight weeks was as effective as 800 mg of cimetidine (400 mg twice a day) in healing duodenal ulcer.
