40|$|Abstract: The {{association}} of carbonatite and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic {{rocks in the}} Dahomeyide suture zone of southeastern Ghana is unique among the Neoproterozoic orogens that surround the West African craton (WAC). Carbonatite occurs in an alkaline complex that decorates the sole thrust of the suture zone and is characterized by high concen-trations of incompatible trace elements such as light rare earth elements (LREE), Sr and Ba. Within the suture zone deformed alkaline rocks, including carbonatite, together with mafic granulites form an imbricate stack of thrust panels that involve 2. 1 Ga rocks of the WAC base-ment. The dominant rock unit of the suture zone is composed of mafic granulites in which garnet megacrysts preserve a diagnostic microstructure of UHP metamorphism; it consists of a crystallographically controlled array of exsolved rutile rods in garnet. Metamorphic pressures estimated from Ti concentrations in the inferred precursor garnet indicate P. 3 GPa, which requires subduction (and exhumation) of the suture zone rocks to and from mantle depths during collisional orogeny on the WAC <b>margin.</b> <b>Available</b> age constraints on carbonatite magma-tism suggest that continental rifting, leading {{to the formation of}} the passive WAC margin c. 700 Ma, occurred c. 100 Ma before intrusion of carbonatite, which was preceded by HP an...|$|E

With this information, the hardware modifications required by the ATWS rule, likely would not have been necessary.

40|$|Future {{aircraft}} turbine engines, both {{commercial and}} military, {{must be able}} to successfully accommodate expected increased levels of steady-state and dynamic engine-face distortion. The current approach of incorporating a sufficient component design stall margin to tolerate these increased levels of distortion would significantly reduce performance. The objective of the High Stability Engine Control (HISTEC) program is to design, develop, and flight demonstrate an advanced, high-stability, integrated engine control system that uses measurement-based, real-time estimates of distortion to enhance engine stability. The resulting distortion tolerant control reduces the required design stall margin, with a corresponding increase in performance and decrease in fuel burn. The HISTEC concept, consisting of a Distortion Estimation System and a Stability Management Control, has been designed and developed. The Distortion Estimation System uses a small number of high-response pressure sensors at the engine face to calculate indicators of the type and extent of distortion in real time. The Stability Management Control, through direct control of the fan and compressor pressure ratio, accommodates the distortion by transiently increasing the amount of stall <b>margin</b> <b>available</b> based on information from the Distortion Estimation System.

The benchmark problem/configuration is a generic burnup credit cask designed to hold 32 pressurized water reactor (PWR) assemblies. The purpose of this computational benchmark {{is to provide a}} reference configuration for the estimation of the additional reactivity margin, which is encouraged in the U. S.

Estimates of additional reactivity margin for this reference configuration may be compared to those of similar burnup-credit casks to provide an indication of the validity of design-specific estimates of fission-product margin.

Although the SAS 2 H and CSAS 25 sequences have been extensively validated elsewhere, the reference solutions are not directly or indirectly based on experimental results.

The response of general practitioners to professional and economic incentives was examined in relation to the location of the practice and the characteristics of the practitioners in seven different areas of England. The areas represented urban, rural, affluent, and deprived communities. The overall response rate was 74 %, but the response varied among the areas, being poorest (64 %) in an inner city area. Practices were subdivided as innovative, traditional, or intermediate, according to whether they employed a nurse and participated in the cost rent scheme and the vocational training scheme. Innovative practices were defined as fulfilling two of these criteria and traditional practices as fulfilling none; the remainder were classed as intermediate. The results showed that these three types of practice had distinct strategies that were related to financial constraints and the local population.
