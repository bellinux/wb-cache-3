5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the <b>mistletoe,</b> holly and yew. <b>Mistletoe</b> is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend <b>mistletoe</b> clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the <b>mistletoe,</b> an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral {{yellow ochre}} mixed with pitch from the piñon tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower lupine {{and a warm}} grey from Juniper <b>mistletoe</b> (Phoradendron juniperinum).|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the <b>mistletoe</b> species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{includes}} the fruits and seeds of bushes and trees, mainly holly, yew, ivy and <b>mistletoe,</b> but also, for example, blackberry, cherry, elder, hawthorn, olive and rose. It may eat {{the flowers and}} shoots of grasses and other plants, and will take fallen apples and plums. It forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields, sometimes sharing these feeding areas with redwings or fieldfares.|$|E
5|$|The show centres on {{the adventures}} and {{exploits}} of the Bellflower family, a clan of seven rabbits {{who live in}} Beechwood Grove. The two adults in the family, Papa Bramble and Aunt Zinnia, {{take care of their}} five children: Periwinkle, Poppy, <b>Mistletoe,</b> Dandelion and Violette.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the <b>mistletoe</b> species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some <b>mistletoe</b> pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus species cause a {{white rot}} by {{breaking}} down lignin in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or <b>mistletoe,</b> or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., <b>mistletoe)</b> hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a <b>mistletoe</b> Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, <b>mistletoe,</b> and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of <b>mistletoe.</b> The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|James, {{under her}} real name, debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw as a face, under the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The angle had the two Divas {{competing}} together in tag team matches, with James' character becoming increasingly obsessed with Stratus. The storyline included a Halloween costume contest, in which James was dressed like Stratus and helped Stratus retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time. James even began utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. James later became the number one contender for the WWE Women's Championship on December 12, by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face Stratus at New Year's Revolution. Subsequently, the storyline between James and Stratus developed into a lesbian angle, after James kissed Stratus under a sprig of <b>mistletoe.</b> In the championship match at the pay-per-view, James lost to Stratus.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, <b>mistletoe</b> being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, Stratus was sidelined {{with the}} Women's Championship after {{suffering}} a herniated disc, with the storyline explanation that Viscera had injured her at Backlash after she insulted him for losing to Kane. This left the company without a Women's Champion for four months, as Stratus remained the champion {{during the time of}} her injury, thus ignoring the 30 day clause stating that a champion must defend their respective title at least once every 30 days. She returned to Raw on September 12, 2005 as a face by siding with Ashley Massaro against Vince's Devils (Candice Michelle, Victoria and Torrie Wilson). The feud also involved the debuting Mickie James, who introduced herself as Stratus' biggest fan. In November, during the Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show, Stratus took part in an inter-promotional Divas battle royal that was won by SmackDown! Diva Melina. The next week, MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) kidnapped Stratus for Melina, who challenged a tied up and gagged Stratus to a match for the Women's Championship. The two fought at Survivor Series, with Stratus defeating Melina. Stratus and Mickie James continued teaming together in late 2005, while James became increasingly obsessed with Stratus. On the December 26 episode of Raw, the storyline between Stratus and James developed into a lesbian one, when James initiated an intimate kiss with Stratus under a sprig of <b>mistletoe,</b> causing a surprised Stratus to flee the locker room.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a <b>mistletoe</b> bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E
5|$|On May14, 1810, the British war {{schooner}} HMS <b>Mistletoe</b> {{arrived at}} Buenos Aires with European newspapers that reported {{the dissolution of}} the Supreme Central Junta the previous January. The city of Seville had been invaded by French armies, which were already dominating most of the Iberian Peninsula. The newspapers reported that some of the former members of the Junta had taken refuge on the Isla de León in Cadiz. This was confirmed in Buenos Aires on May17, when the British frigate HMS John Paris arrived in Montevideo; the most recent newspapers reported that members of the Supreme Central Junta had been dismissed. The Council of Regency of Cadiz was not seen as a successor of the Spanish resistance but as an attempt to restore absolutism in Spain. The Supreme Central Junta was seen as sympathetic to the new ideas. South American patriots feared both a complete French victory in the peninsula and an absolutist restoration. Cisneros monitored the British warships and seized their newspapers, to conceal the news, but a newspaper came into the hands of Belgrano and Castelli. They spread the news among other patriots and challenged the legitimacy of the Viceroy, who had been appointed by the fallen junta. When Cornelio Saavedra, head of the regiment of Patricians, was informed of this news, he decided that it was finally the ideal time to take action against Cisneros. Martín Rodríguez proposed to overthrow the Viceroy by force, but Castelli and Saavedra rejected this idea and proposed the convening of an open cabildo.|$|E

25|$|In some Western {{cultures}} it {{is considered}} good luck to kiss someone on Christmas or on New Year's Eve, especially beneath a sprig of <b>mistletoe.</b> Newlyweds usually kiss {{at the end of}} a wedding ceremony.|$|E
25|$|In 2006–07 {{he served}} as President of Surrey County Cricket Club. In 2012 {{he said he had}} been cured of cancer by a course of {{injections}} of <b>mistletoe</b> extract, and was fit and active again. He now lives in Aberdeenshire.|$|E
25|$|The university's Program Board, {{which puts}} {{on many of}} the concerts on campus as well as the annual <b>Mistletoe</b> Ball, {{provides}} other activities for the entire CUA community. Previous events include ski trips, advance screenings of movies, Noise In The Pryz, and the Movies on the Mall.|$|E
25|$|The first cookie {{sales by}} an {{individual}} Scout unit was by the <b>Mistletoe</b> Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in December 1917 at their local high school. In 1922, the Girl Scout magazine The American Girl suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser and provided a simple cookie recipe from a regional director for the Girl Scouts of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Annual events include week-long Homecoming celebrations, the Mr. CUA competition, and {{a number}} of dances {{including}} the Beaux Arts Ball, the <b>Mistletoe</b> Ball, and the Athletes Ball. In addition to the radio station WCUA, other campus media outlets include The Crosier, a scholarly publication concerning Catholic social teaching, The Tower, the campus' independent weekly newspaper, and CRUX, a literary magazine.|$|E
25|$|In biology, {{parasitism}} is a non-mutual {{relationship between}} species, where one species, the parasite, benefits {{at the expense}} of the other, the host. Traditionally parasite primarily meant an organism visible to the naked eye, or a macroparasite (such as a helminth). Microparasites are typically far smaller, such as protozoa, viruses, and bacteria. Examples of parasites include the plants <b>mistletoe</b> and cuscuta, and animals such as hookworms.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless Balderus took {{heart of}} grace and again met Høtherus in a {{stricken}} field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a magic sword, named <b>Mistletoe,</b> which he had received from Miming, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.|$|E
25|$|Next day, <b>Mistletoe,</b> {{another young}} Bellflower, {{insists that the}} house's fixing up be finished. He calls on his four {{siblings}} for the task, and they secretly set off to do it. However, when Papa enters to get a lost tool, he is dismayed at the mess they have made. Angrily, he and Aunt Zinnia send them back home, and the father cleans up after them.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird {{had given birth to}} a woodpecker, and some plant to the <b>mistletoe,</b> and that these had been {{produced}} perfect as we now see them; but this assumption {{seems to me to be}} no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.|$|E
25|$|When the god Baldr {{began to}} have prophetic dreams of his own death, his mother Frigg {{extracted}} an oath from all things in nature not to harm him. However, she neglected the <b>mistletoe,</b> thinking it {{was too young to}} make, let alone respect, such a solemn vow. When Loki learned of this weakness, he had a javelin or dart made from one of its branches and tricked Hod, the blind god, into hurling it at Baldr and causing his death.|$|E
25|$|Bricne Nimhtheanga {{decided to}} set off for Dún Flidhais fort in Erris. His plan was to cause trouble. Travellers {{associated}} with the Queen of Connacht were treated with great courtesy everywhere they went so when Bricne arrived at Rathmorgan he was courteously welcomed, wined and dined by Flidhais and her entourage who all turned out in their best finery for the occasion. Flidhais had the fort heavily perfumed and decorated with <b>mistletoe</b> and herbs and they wined and dined in great style.|$|E
25|$|Anyone or {{anything}} suspended on the axis between {{heaven and earth}} becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a serpent, a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, <b>mistletoe.</b> Derivations of this idea find form in the Rod of Asclepius, an emblem of the medical profession, and in the caduceus, an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the serpents act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Soon, {{he announces}} that two {{strapping}} rams {{will carry the}} family's furniture in carts; the Pedal Express will be involved as well. When the day comes, Bramble, <b>Mistletoe,</b> Poppy and the Bellflowers' neighbours help out on the goods, while Zinnia and the other children wait for them at The Berries. By afternoon, everything is in place, but the bunnies find out that Periwinkle is nowhere in sight. Instead, the lonely child {{has set up a}} small canvas tent near the old home, close to a hazelnut grove.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{there have}} been {{problems}} with droughts and pest infestations. These include the roundheaded pine beetle, European <b>mistletoe</b> and caterpillars. Some residents see the event as divine will but others place global warming. It is not {{know how much of}} the oaks, junipers and pines that make up most of the forested areas have been compromised but there are visible yellow patches seen in the otherwise green forest. The pests have been able to infest more because trees are weak due to drought conditions.|$|E
25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a <b>mistletoe</b> leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As <b>mistletoe</b> is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E
25|$|Nancy, , <b>Mistletoe,</b> and {{the hired}} armed brig Pitt were {{anchored}} in the harbour of Buenos Aires on 25 May 1810 during May Week, when the revolution {{broke out in the}} city. Captain Fabian of Mutine broke out bunting and the British vessels saluted the revolution with salvos of cannon. Fabian also gave a rousing speech on liberty and revolution, praising the revolutionaries for having gained their freedom. On 28 May Pitt sailed to Rio de Janeiro with the news of the uprising. Mutine sailed for Britain with the same news on 3 June.|$|E
