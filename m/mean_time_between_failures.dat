50|$|Availability, {{operational}} (Ao) The {{probability that}} an item will operate satisfactorily {{at a given}} point in time when used in an actual or realistic operating and support environment. It includes logistics time, ready time, and waiting or administrative downtime, and both preventive and corrective maintenance downtime.

40|$|Software {{reliability}} assessment {{had been a}} major issue among the researchers in the recent past. Two important characteristics to assess software reliability are MTBF (<b>Mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure)</b> and number of errors. In this paper, we capture and extract workload and failure data from server logs of a web application named College Excel. Classify the workload data based on four parameters. Calculating the cumulative values of four workload parameters and error for 30 days we plot graphs and verify the relationship <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> and different workload parameters. We also calculate {{the reliability of the}} College Excel web application using Nelson model (one of the most widely used input domain reliability model) and MTBF (<b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure)</b> using failure and different workload units...|$|R
25|$|CADET used 324 {{point-contact}} transistors {{provided by}} the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables; 76 junction transistors {{were used for the}} first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were too noisy. From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine's <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable bipolar junction transistors became available.|$|E
500|$|As a {{computer}} system grows in complexity, the <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> usually decreases. Application checkpointing is a technique whereby the computer system takes a [...] "snapshot" [...] of the application—a record of all current resource allocations and variable states, akin to a core dump—; this information {{can be used to}} restore the program if the computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.|$|E

2500|$|The Hornet is also {{notable for}} having been {{designed}} to reduce maintenance, {{and as a result}} has required far less downtime than its heavier counterparts, the F-14 Tomcat and the A-6 Intruder. Its <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time. [...] Its General Electric F404 engines were also innovative in that they were designed with operability, reliability and maintainability first. The engine, while unexceptional in rated performance, demonstrates exceptional robustness under various conditions and is resistant to stall and flameout. [...] The F404 engine connects to the airframe at only 10 points and can be replaced without special equipment; a four-person team can remove the engine within 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The fighter-interceptor {{version of}} the Viggen, the JA 37, {{featured}} various avionics changes, including the extensive use of digital electronics alongside mechanical technology. In 1985, the [...] "fighter link" [...] went into service, permitting encrypted data communication between four fighters; this enabled one fighter to [...] "paint" [...] an airborne enemy with guidance radar for the Skyflash missiles of the three other fighters in a group while they had their search and guidance radar switched off. This system was operational ten years before any other country's. [...] The autopilot was also slaved to the radar control to obtain better precision firing the cannon. Once in service, the Viggen's software was regularly updated every 18 months.
