The applications of proposed fuzzy <b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> divergence measures {{in the context of}} pattern recognition have been presented using a numerical example. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy <b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> divergence measures are well suited to use with linguistic variables.

Methods: Fifty seven adolescents (mean age 14. 28 years) with chronic pain and 57 accompanying adults underwent an interdisciplinary three week residential programme of group cognitive behavioural therapy. Mean chronicity of pain was 4. 02 years; 75 % were absent from full time education (mean absence 17 months). Results: Post-treatment adolescents reported significant improvements for self report of disability (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 3. 37 (95 % CI 0. 65 to 6. 09)), physical function (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> timed walk of 2. 61 seconds (1. 02 to 4. 2) and sit to stand of 3. 22 per minute (0. 79 to 5. 65)). At three months post-treatment adolescents maintained physical improvements and reduced anxiety (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 1. 7 (0. 72 to 2. 67)), disability (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 4. 3 (1. 44 to 7. 17)), and somatic awareness (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 4. 43 (1. 53 to 7. 33)). Following treatment adults reported significant improvement in their report of adolescent disability (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 4. 43 (2. 17 to 6. 7)), adult anxiety (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 1. 73 (0. 54 to 2. 92)), depression (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 1. 16 (0. 34 to 1. 98)), and parental stress (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 10. 81 (2. 91 to 18. 78)).

5000|$|Several {{reliability}} {{tests have}} been performed on the SB5 including split-half reliability, standard error of measurement, plotting of test information curves, test-retest stability, and inter-scorer agreement. On average, the IQ scores for this scale {{have been found to}} be quite stable across time (Janzen, Obrzut, & Marusiak, 2003). Internal consistency was tested by split-half reliability and was reported to be substantial and comparable to other cognitive batteries (Bain & Allin, 2005). The median interscorer correlation was found to be [...]90 on average (Janzen, Obrzut, & Marusiak, 2003). The SB5 has also been found to have great precision at advanced levels of performance meaning that the test is especially useful in testing children for giftedness (Bain & Allin, 2005). There have only been a small amount of practice effects and familiarity of testing procedures with retest reliability; however, these have proven to be insignificant.

50|$|While {{knowledge}} of effectiveness is vital, {{it is also}} important to understand the reasons for effectiveness and the circumstances under which results are likely to be replicated. In contrast with ‘black box’ Impact Evaluation approaches, which only report <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> in outcomes between treatment and comparison groups, Theory-Based Impact Evaluation involves mapping out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and testing the underlying assumptions. Most interventions within the realm of public policy are of a voluntary, rather than coercive (legally required) nature. In addition, interventions are often active rather than passive, requiring a greater rather than lesser degree of participation among beneficiaries and therefore behavior change as a pre-requisite for effectiveness. Public policy will therefore be successful to the extent that people are incentivized to change their behaviour favourably. A Theory-Based approach enables policy-makers to understand the reasons for differing levels of program participation (referred to as ‘compliance’ or ‘adherence’) and the processes determining behavior change. Theory-Based approaches use both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and the latter can be particularly useful in understanding the reasons for compliance and therefore whether and how the intervention may be replicated in other settings. Methods of qualitative data collection include focus groups, in-depth interviews, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and field visits, as well as reading of anthropological and political literature.|$|E

The present study examined the tendency of a subject to be competitive or non-competitive oriented using the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ). Subjects included 40 elementary male and female students ages 9 - 11 years old enrolled in two different physical education classes. Prior to the administration of the three fitness tests, all subjects completed the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ). The subjects completed the 1 -mile run, 1 -mile walk, and PACER shuttle run counterbalanced over a four-week time period, completing no more than one fitness test per week. Subjects were required to complete the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES) pre- and post fitness test in order to determine changes in positive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue. An ANOVA revealed no significant <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> between a subject’s competitive orientation and fitness test among all SEES factors (PWB, PD, FAT). Data was further analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA. A significant difference was indicated between <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> among fitness tests for both positive well-being and psychological distress. No significant difference between <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> among fitness tests was indicated for fatigue. These findings support the hypothesis that subjects would indicate higher <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> of PWB after a low exertion fitness test (1 -mile walk) compared to high exertion fitness tests (1 -mile run and PACER).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} and snoring {{are common in}} pregnancy. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether pregnancy was associated with upper airway narrowing. One-hundred females in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited and 50 agreed to be restudied 3 months after delivery. One-hundred nonpregnant females were also recruited. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Snoring was less common in nonpregnant (17 %) than pregnant females (41 %; odds ratio (OR) 3. 34; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 65 – 6. 74) and returned to nonpregnant levels after delivery (18 %; OR 0. 15; 95 % CI 0. 06 – 0. 40). Pregnant females had significantly smaller upper airways than nonpregnant females at the oropharyngeal junction when seated (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 12; 95 % CI 0. 008 – 0. 25), and smaller mean pharyngeal areas in the seated (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 14; 95 % CI 0. 001 – 0. 28), supine (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 01 – 0. 22) and lateral postures (<b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 13; 95 % CI 0. 02 – 0. 24) compared with the nonpregnant females.
