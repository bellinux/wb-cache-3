50|$|Like {{the network}} itself, these {{developing}} norms {{remain in a}} state of flux and vary from community to community. The points most strongly emphasized about Usenet netiquette often include using simple electronic signatures, and avoiding <b>multiposting,</b> cross-posting, off-topic posting, hijacking a discussion thread, and other techniques used to minimize the effort required to read a post or a thread. Similarly, some Usenet guidelines call for use of unabbreviated English while users of instant messaging protocols like SMS occasionally encourage just the opposite, bolstering use of SMS language. However, many online communities frown upon this practice.|$|E
5000|$|Crossposting is {{the act of}} posting {{the same}} message to {{multiple}} information channels; forums, mailing lists, or newsgroups. This is distinct from <b>multiposting,</b> which is the posting of separate identical messages, individually, to each channel, (a forum, a newsgroup, an email list, or topic area). Enforcement actions against crossposting individuals vary from simple admonishments up to total lifetime bans. In some cases, on email lists and forums, an individual is put under a Stealth Ban where their posts are distributed back to {{them as if they}} were being distributed normally, but the rest of the subscribers are not sent the messages. This is easily detected if the Stealthed individual has two different, and totally non-associated identities in the channel, such that the non-stealthed identity will see a different set of messages, lacking the posts of the stealthed individual, in their view of the channel.|$|E
40|$|Exploratory {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with several conceptual radiative heat shields of composite construction. Measured transient temperature distributions were obtained for a graphite heat shield without insulation and with three types of insulating materials, and for a metal <b>multipost</b> heat shield, at surface temperatures of approximately 2, 000 F and 1, 450 F, respectively, by use of a radiant-heat facility. The graphite configurations suffered loss of surface material under repeated irradiation. Temperature distribution calculated for the metal heat shield by a numerical procedure was in good agreement with measured data. Environmental survival tests of the graphite heat shield without insulation, an insulated <b>multipost</b> heat shield, and a stainless-steel-tile heat shield were made at temperatures of 2, 000 F and dynamic pressures of approximately 6, 000 lb/sq ft, provided by an ethylene-heated jet operating at a Mach number of 2. 0 and sea-level conditions. The graphite heat shield survived the simulated aerodynamic heating and pressure loading. A problem area exists {{in the design and}} materials for heat-resistant fasteners between the graphite shield and the base structure. The insulated <b>multipost</b> heat shield was found to be superior to the stainless-steel-tile heat shield in retarding heat flow. Over-lapped face-plate joints and surface smoothness of the insulated multi- post heat shield were not adversely affected by the test environment. The graphite heat shield without insulation survived tests made in the acoustic environment of a large air jet. This acoustic environment is random in frequency and has an overall noise level of 160 decibels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany systems rank {{outcomes}} before suggesting {{them to a}} user, such as Recommender Systems or Information Retrieval Algo- rithms. These systems require manual validation, {{which is}} time consuming and costly in industrial context. As {{it is the case}} in our industrial applications, we assume that the user's needs can be fulfilled by only one relevant outcome. We thus consider an algorithm that systematically selects the top ranked outcome. This approach requires to compute a correctness, estimating the confidence of the automatic decision, or equivalently how likely the first outcome of the ranking system is to be correct. Based on this estimation, we can apply a threshold on the correctness, above which no manual action is required; the system avoids human validation in many cases. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate this correctness based on a supervised classification approach using the manual validations available in the base coupled with a representation of the system's scores. We conducted experiments on <b>Multiposting</b> real-world datasets generated by algorithms used in the industry; the first algorithm categorizes a job offer, the second recommends semantic equivalents for a given expression in a nomenclature. Our approach has thereby been evaluated and compared, and showed good results on our datasets, even with a limited training base. Moreover, in our experiments, for a given threshold, the better is the correctness estimation, the more performant is the semi-automatic system, showing that the correctness estimation leads thus to a crucial efficiency gain...|$|E
40|$|In {{our society}} based on communication, the barrier between the spoken and gestural {{languages}} remains a main {{problem for the}} deaf-mute. To make this communication possible, we propose developing an interface using mobile phone camera with a module of recognition allowing the recognition and the restitution of the sign language {{in the form of}} synthesized words. This module is based on a spectral comparison between the image to recognize and a correlation multidecision segmented filter resulting from images reference coming from a predetermined database: correlation technique. The latter has been used {{for a long time to}} recognize a target image. However an adaptation of this technique is necessary to take into account particular characteristics of gestures (for which the target image to recognize evolves in time) and to be able to send it with a high transmission rate. Thus to obtain a reliable decision, the module of recognition must carry out a very large number of correlations, which slows down the translation process. In order to reduce this processing time, we propose implementing our recognition module by using <b>multipost</b> technique “PVM”. This technique is based on the distribution of calculation on various stations in parallel. Thi...|$|R
40|$|Within {{conceptual}} design changes occur rapidly {{due to a}} combination of uncertainty and shifting requirements. To stay relevant in this fluid time, trade studies must also be performed rapidly. In order to drive down analysis time while improving the information gained by these studies, surrogate models can be created to represent the complex output of a tool or tools within a specified tradespace. In order to create this model however, a large amount of data must be collected in a short amount of time. By this method, the historical approach of relying on subject matter experts to generate the data required is schedule infeasible. However, by implementing automation and distributed analysis the required data can be generated in a fraction of the time. Previous work focused on setting up a tool called <b>multiPOST</b> capable of orchestrating many simultaneous runs of an analysis tool assessing these automated analyses utilizing heuristics gleaned from the best practices of current subject matter experts. In this update to the previous work, elements of graph theory are included to further drive down analysis time by leveraging data previously gathered. It is shown to outperform the previous method in both time required, and {{the quantity and quality of}} data produced...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that decisions made {{in the early stages of}} Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design commit up to 80 % of total Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) while engineers know the least about the product they are designing [1]. Once within Preliminary and Detailed design however, making changes to the design becomes far more difficult to enact in both cost and schedule. Primarily this has been due to a lack of detailed data usually uncovered later during the Preliminary and Detailed design phases. In our current budget-constrained environment, making decisions within Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design which minimize LCC while meeting requirements is paramount to a program's success. Within the arena of launch vehicle design, optimizing the ascent trajectory is critical for minimizing the costs present within such concerns as propellant, aerodynamic, aeroheating, and acceleration loads while meeting requirements such as payload delivered to a desired orbit. In order to optimize the vehicle design its constraints and requirements must be known, however as the design cycle proceeds it is all but inevitable that the conditions will change. Upon that change, the previously optimized trajectory may no longer be optimal, or meet design requirements. The current paradigm for adjusting to these updates is generating point solutions for every change in the design's requirements [2]. This can be a tedious, time-consuming task as changes in virtually any piece of a launch vehicle's design can have a disproportionately large effect on the ascent trajectory, as the solution space of the trajectory optimization problem is both non-linear and multimodal [3]. In addition, an industry standard tool, Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST), requires an expert analyst to produce simulated trajectories that are feasible and optimal [4]. In a previous publication the authors presented a method for combatting these challenges [5]. In order to bring more detailed information into Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design, knowledge of the effects originating from changes to the vehicle must be calculated. In order to do this, a model capable of quantitatively describing any vehicle within the entire design space under consideration must be constructed. This model must be based upon analysis of acceptable fidelity, which in this work comes from POST. Design space interrogation can be achieved with surrogate modeling, a parametric, polynomial equation representing a tool. A surrogate model must be informed by data from the tool with enough points to represent the solution space for the chosen number of variables with an acceptable level of error. Therefore, Design Of Experiments (DOE) is used to select points within the design space to maximize information gained on the design space while minimizing number of data points required. To represent a design space with a non-trivial number of variable parameters the number of points required still represent an amount of work which would take an inordinate amount of time via the current paradigm of manual analysis, and so an automated method was developed. The best practices of expert trajectory analysts working within NASA Marshall's Advanced Concepts Office (ACO) were implemented within a tool called <b>multiPOST.</b> These practices include how to use the output data from a previous run of POST to inform the next, determining whether a trajectory solution is feasible from a real-world perspective, and how to handle program execution errors. The tool was then augmented with multiprocessing capability to enable analysis on multiple trajectories simultaneously, allowing throughput to scale with available computational resources. In this update to the previous work the authors discuss issues with the method and solutions...|$|R
