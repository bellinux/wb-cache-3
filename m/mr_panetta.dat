McRaven, {{commander}} of the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command, to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to give him details about the compound and to begin planning a military strike. Admiral McRaven, {{a veteran of the}} covert world who had written a book on American Special Operations, spent weeks working with the CIA on the operation, and came up with three options: a helicopter assault using U.S. Navy SEALs, a strike with B-2 bombers that would obliterate the compound, or a joint raid with Pakistani intelligence operatives who would be told about the mission hours before the launch." [...] The day before the assault, President Obama [...] "took a break from rehearsing for the White House Correspondents Dinner that night to call Admiral McRaven, to wish him luck."
