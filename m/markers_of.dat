5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E

5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Macedonia. In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances.

5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> severe respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{state of}} DKA is associated, {{in addition to}} the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines, the latter of which leads to increased <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> inflammation, {{even in the absence of}} infection.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{most cases}} of {{cervical}} cancers, HPV DNA is {{integrated into the}} genome of carcinoma cells. This mutational insertion constitutes a highly specific molecular <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> tumor DNA for every patient. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> tumor dynamics which detection requires specific molecular motif. To determine whether the sequence of the cell-viral junction {{could be used in}} clinical practice as a specific <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> ctDNA, we analyzed a series of cervical cancer patient serums...|$|R

5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be detected. Other <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> muscle damage, such as aldolase, troponin, carbonic anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E

40|$|Sera from 64 {{patients}} with HBsAg-negative chronic liver disease {{with or without}} cirrhosis were investigated for aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen (sP-III-P) as a suitable <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> hepatic fibrosis; 244 healthy control subjects {{were included in the}} study. A close correlation (p less than 0. 01) between sP-III-P levels and histological activity was observed; on the contrary, no correlation was found between the same serum <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> liver fibroplasia and biochemical activity or clinical severity of the disease. We conclude that sP-III-P as a suitable <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> liver overload of collagen fibers is strongly correlated with the histological activity of the disease. Local immune reactions produce soluble substances that might stimulate fibroblastic activity. The test has a significant sensitivity and a very high specificity as a <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> chronic liver disease with histological activity...|$|R
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
