5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and <b>marshaling</b> yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan <b>marshaling</b> yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey dashed up the North Korean coast raiding {{transportation}} facilities from 1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, Iowon, Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two <b>marshaling</b> yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong {{and near the}} Chang-San-Got Peninsula 11 and 13 November, New Jersey completed her first {{tour of duty in}} Korea.|$|E
5|$|After al-Ghazali's downfall, the Hubaysh clan, who {{had since}} been forced out by Qa'itbay {{and settled in}} Lassa, sought to oust Qa'itbay. They kidnapped Hasan's son Mansur, who Qa'itbay had spared from {{execution}} due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children, and organized a revolt against Qa'itbay in Mansur's name. The revolt quickly spread through Qa'itbay's territories, but after <b>marshaling</b> financial resources to mobilize military support from the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe of the Beqaa Valley, he managed to drive his opponents back to Lassa. Qa'itbay died without a male heir in 1523, and was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur, who Qa'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children.|$|E

50|$|During some {{periods of}} {{effective}} or claimed Royal union of Portugal with other states, the Portuguese shield was used <b>marshaled</b> with the coats of arms of those states. Beatrice of Portugal, who claimed the Portuguese crown during the 1383-1385 interregnum, used the Portuguese {{arms in the}} II and III positions of the shield, <b>marshaled</b> with the arms of her husband King John I of Castile in the I and IV. King Afonso V of Portugal, who claimed the crown of Castile during the 1475-1479 period, used the Portuguese arms in the I and IV, <b>marshaled</b> with the arms of Castile and León in the II and III. During {{the period of the}} Iberian Union (1580-1640), the Portuguese shield was placed in the honour point of the complex coat of arms of the House of Habsburg. These <b>marshaled</b> coats of arms had, however, a very limited use, with the simple Portuguese coat of arms being used in the national context and the <b>marshaled</b> arms being only used when they intended to represent personally the monarch.|$|R

5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, homeless people, street children and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a <b>marshaling</b> center for beggars and street children, {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people {{in and out of the}} centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, the UN Far East Air Force Bomber Command began {{a steady}} and {{increasing}} campaign against strategic North Korean logistics targets. The {{first of these}} targets was Wonsan on the east coast. Wonsan was important as a communications center that linked Vladivostok, Siberia, with North Korea by rail and sea. From it, rail lines ran to all the North Korean build-up centers. The great bulk of Russian supplies for North Korea {{in the early part}} of the war came in at Wonsan, and from the beginning it was considered a major military target. By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought to cut the flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and <b>marshaling</b> yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan <b>marshaling</b> yards, would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On August 4, FEAF began B-29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea and, on August 15, light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction campaign.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Wonsan {{at the end}} of January, Wisconsin bombarded enemy guns at Hodo Pando {{before she}} was rearmed at Sasebo. The {{battleship}} rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and <b>marshaling</b> yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating Jourdan's move, Charles rushed {{his army}} toward battle at Würzburg on 1 September. <b>Marshaling</b> the {{divisions}} of Hotze, Sztáray, Kray, Johann Sigismund Riesch, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein and Wartensleben, the Austrians won the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, forcing the French {{to retreat to}} the Lahn river. Charles lost 1,500 casualties out of 44,000 troops there, while inflicting 2,000 casualties on the outnumbered French. Another authority gave French losses as 2,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 men and seven guns captured, while Austrian losses numbered 1,200 killed and wounded and 300 captured. Regardless, the losses at Würzburg compelled the French to lift the siege of Mainz on 7 September, and to move those troops to reinforce their lines further east.|$|E
5|$|McClellan {{was removed}} {{after failing to}} pursue General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Antietam, and Burnside was {{assigned}} to command the Army of the Potomac on November 7, 1862. He reluctantly obeyed this order, the third such in his brief career, {{in part because the}} courier told him that, if he refused it, the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked. President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and approved his plan on November 14 to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13. His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid, but the attack was delayed by his planning in <b>marshaling</b> pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River, as well as his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points. This allowed Gen. Lee to concentrate along Marye's Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{sailed to}} the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, {{returning}} to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad <b>marshaling</b> yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E

25|$|The {{route of}} the {{proposed}} new line and in particular, the proposed siting of new <b>marshaling</b> yards at Rotorua {{was the reason for}} much of the objections. NZR wanted to extend the existing Rotorua Branch line from the central city station, across Fenton Street to Ngapuna where they proposed having a large <b>marshaling</b> yard, along with a spur line running south to the Waipa State Mill. Many people in Rotorua objected to having a railway crossing Fenton Street and wanted the railway <b>marshaling</b> yards located at Waipa instead of Ngapuna. NZR objected to shifting the <b>marshaling</b> yards, as it would significantly increase the cost of the project.|$|E

50|$|An {{application}} program (input sequential program) is processed in three stages: preliminary code reorganization (code reorganizer), static scheduling {{of the statements}} (static scheduler) and compiling/loading (compiler, loader). The output after the static scheduling stages is a multiple clusters flow that feeds the multithreaded engine via the interface designed {{in a way to}} avoid bottlenecks. The multiple clusters flow {{can be thought of as}} a compiled input program split into <b>marshaled</b> clusters, in which all addresses are resolved and extended with context information. Splitting into <b>marshaled</b> clusters allows loading them multithreadedly. Context information lets iterations be processed in parallel. Listener thread orders the output stream after the out-of-order processing.|$|R
