5|$|On 13 May, Del Piero started Juventus's final league game of {{the season}} against Atalanta, marking the {{occasion}} and the victory of their 28th Serie A title by scoring a goal. Twenty-seven minutes into the match, Del Piero picked the ball up {{at the edge of the}} penalty box and placed a shot past Giorgio Frezzolini to make the score 2â€“0, helping Juventus to go undefeated in Serie A that season. He was substituted off after 59 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> emotional response from both sets of players and supporters, as he made a lap of honour around the pitch. This was Alessandro Del Piero's final Serie A appearance for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal {{and the two men}} adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E

25|$|They {{are natural}} hunters with an {{excellent}} {{ability to take}} training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, {{making the most of}} their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a gender}} {{division}} of labor {{in the process of}} collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and {{knowing what to do}} {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to having abilities becoming stronger during the game, players are able to buy items that provide their own special abilities. Items {{are not limited to}} specific heroes, and can be bought by anyone. In order to obtain an item, players must be able to afford it with gold at shops located on the map, which is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes, destroying enemy structures, and killing creeps, with the latter being an act called [...] "farming". Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it, an act called [...] "last hitting", but all allies receive a share of gold when an enemy hero dies close to them. Players are also able to [...] "deny" [...] allied units and structures by last hitting them, which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience from them. Gold can not be shared between teammates, with each player having their own independent stash. Players also receive a continuous, but small stream of gold {{over the course of a}} match. Matches usually last between 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour, although they can theoretically last forever as long as both Ancients remain standing.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{handling}} of ground combat {{received the most}} substantial criticism. Computer Gaming World's editorial staff wrote that the game's real-time combat system was [...] "handled so fast that players didn't have a chance in 90% of the battles." [...] According to reviewer L.S. Lichtmann, [...] "many are disappointed because the phased, tactical system of Traveller has been modified to have arcade game characteristics." [...] He also stated that the player does not compete on a [...] "level playing field" [...] {{when he or she}} must issue commands in real-time to individual party members engaged in combat while the computer simultaneously controls multiple non-player characters. Paragon responded to these criticisms by releasing an updated version of the game which gave the player the ability to pause the combat to issue orders to party members. But even after this update, some reviewers still found that, whenever possible, it is still far easier for the party to flee from ground combat situations than to fight. Moreover, immediately after the player assumes control of the party {{at the start of the}} game, it is attacked by well-armed opponents. The Computer Gaming World editorial staff criticized this design choice by stating that the [...] "player would have to run away from the first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour generating a character." ...|$|E

It {{was transferred to}} 145th Brigade in the 48th Division in March 1940, bringing it alongside 5th Battalion in the division's 144th Brigade, which had arrived in France on 15 January 1940. In May 1940, during the Battle of France, the German breakthrough at Sedan precipitated a retreat to Dunkirk. In 83 hours 5th Battalion marched 95 miles with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19 May, 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing {{in a matter of}} <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20 May when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut (Scheldt) for two days before the BEF resumed its retreat. On 25 May, 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of 'Somer Force'. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the outer perimeter around Dunkirk. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27 May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29 May, but few made it to Dunkirk. 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties in the stand at Cassel, 472 of them POWs. Meanwhile, 5th Battalion was given a similar task at Ledringhem, some [...] north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26 May, and the first attacks came the next day. On 28 May the village was surrounded, and the battalion withdrew under orders {{in the early hours of}} 29 May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day, and were subsequently taken off the beach by little ships. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.|$|E

[...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry.
