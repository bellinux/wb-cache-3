25|$|Hemp jewelry is {{the product}} of {{knotting}} hemp twine through the practice of <b>macramé.</b> Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors.

25|$|Traditional {{dress for}} women {{consists}} of a skirt decorated with stripes and a cotton blouse with short sleeves and a square neckline which is embroidered in bright colors. This embroidery often has images of humans and animals done in cross-stitch or with beads. A poncho-like garment called a quezquémetl is worn over the blouse, which is usually white with a wide purple or red trim. If it is sunny, this garment is then usually folded to be worn on the head. Traditional dress for men consists of pants and a shirt in plain cotton with a white cotton belt, with a <b>macramé</b> fringe and bright colored embroidery. A heavier shirt in black or blue with white stripes may be worn over this along with an ixtle fiber bag and huarache sandals. A local type of basket which is still in use is called a tancolote, which has a frame of tree branches.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of V'Ger caused {{problems for the}} entire production. The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot clay model created by the Abel group, which looked like a modernized Nemo's Nautilus submarine. Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize {{a new version of}} the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. The final model was [...] long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, <b>macramé,</b> Styrofoam cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from his}} Taggart work in 1986, he also {{directed}} a televised Scottish Opera performance of Rossini's La cambiale di matrimonio on 9 July 1986. And from 1986 to 1988, he produced or directed various children's television {{plays in the}} Dramarama series which ran from 1983 to 1989 on Scottish Television. These were My Mum's a Courgette (with Elaine C Smith) by Janice Halley, Waiting for Elvis by Alex Norton, Stan's First Night (with Gregor Fisher) by Alex Norton, Brainwaves by Anne Marie De Mambro, The Secret of Croftmore (featuring a sixteen-year-old David Tennant) by James Graham and The <b>Macramé</b> Man by Stuart Hepburn, starring Mark MacManus. His other major work of that period, broadcast on 31 December 1988, was The Steamie, with Eileen McCallum, Dorothy Paul, Katy Murphy, Sheila Donald and PeterMullan a [...] "TV version of the stage play by Tony Roper", which he co-produced and directed, and in which a group of Scottish [...] try to finish their work in the Public Washouse before the Hogmanay festivities start. His contributions to Take the High Road continued in parallel that year, and in 1989 he directed the 60 minute drama Albert and the Lion, by Kevin Clarke, which starred James Ellis and Russell Hunter. On three consecutive years from 1990 to 1992 he Produced and Directed the Hogmanay Show for STV. [...] These were innovative in that the music was integrated with a story. [...] A Guid New Year was set in an imaginary flat in Glasgow. A' the Best was set in an hotel (The Heidrum Hodrum) hosting a TV Hogmany Show ( [...] thinly disguised send up of BBC's disastrous broadcast from the Gleneagles Hotel).

60|$|To Cecil {{this seemed}} the anxious desire for her lawful rights. She {{had been used}} to spend the greater part of the evening at the piano, but her awakened eyes {{perceived}} that this was a cover to Raymond's conversations at his mother's sofa; so she sat tying knots in stiff thread at her <b>macrame</b> lace pillow, making the bazaar a plea for nothing but work. Raymond used to arm himself with the newspapers as the safest point d'appui, and the talk was happiest when it only languished, for it could do much worse.|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} {{reminders}} to us, {{and to the}} little town, of the blood-red line drawn across the map of France. We had in our hospital men from the invaded countries without news of wives and families mured up behind that iron veil. Once in a way a tiny word would get through to them, and anxiety would lift a little from their hearts; {{for a day or}} two they would smile. One we had, paralysed in the legs, who would sit doing <b>macramé</b> work and playing chess all day long; every relative he had--wife, father, mother, sisters--all were in the power of the German. As brave a nature as one could see in a year's march, touchingly grateful, touchingly cheerful, but with the saddest eyes I ever saw. There was one little reminder in the town whom we could never help going in to look at whenever we passed the shop whose people had given her refuge. A little girl of eight with the most charming, grave, pale, little, grey-eyed face; there she would sit, playing with her doll, watching the customers. That little refugee at all events was beloved and happy; only I think she thought we would kidnap her one day--we stared at her so hard. She had the quality which gives to certain faces the fascination belonging to rare works of art.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Macramé</b> {{was most}} {{popular in the}} Victorian era. Sylvia's Book of <b>Macramé</b> Lace (1882), a favorite, showed readers how [...] "to work rich {{trimmings}} for black and coloured costumes, both for home wear, garden parties, seaside ramblings, and balls - fairylike adornments for household and underlinens ..." [...] Most Victorian homes were adorned by this craft. <b>Macramé</b> was used to make household items such as tablecloths, bedspreads and curtains.|$|E
5000|$|In the Western Hemisphere, <b>macramé</b> is {{believed}} to have originated with 13th-century Arab weavers. These artisans knotted the excess thread and yarn along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The Spanish word <b>macramé</b> is derived from the Arabic migramah (مقرمة), believed to mean [...] "striped towel", [...] "ornamental fringe" [...] or [...] "embroidered veil." [...] After the Moorish conquest, the art was taken to Spain, then to Italy, especially in the region of Liguria, and then spread through Europe. It was introduced into England at the court of Mary II in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught the art of <b>macramé</b> to her ladies-in-waiting.Sailors made <b>macramé</b> objects in off hours while at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to places like China and the New World. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made hammocks, bell fringes, and belts from <b>macramé.</b> They called the process [...] "square knotting" [...] after the knot they used most frequently. Sailors also called <b>macramé</b> [...] "McNamara's lace".|$|E
50|$|Leather or fabric belts {{are another}} {{accessory}} often created via <b>macramé</b> techniques.

50|$|For larger {{decorative}} pieces, such as wall hangings or window coverings, {{a work of}} <b>macramé</b> {{might be}} started out on a wooden or metal dowel, allowing for a spread of dozens of cords {{that are easy to}} manipulate.

Many craft stores offer beginners' kits, work boards, beads and materials ranging in price for the casual hobbyist or ambitious craftsperson.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macramé</b> {{comes from}} a 13th-century Arabic weavers’ word migramah meaning “fringe”.

In ropework, the frayed end of a rope is held together by a type of knot called a whipping knot. Many types of textiles use knots to repair damage. <b>Macrame,</b> one kind of textile, is generated exclusively {{through the use of}} knotting, instead of knits, crochets, weaves or felting. <b>Macramé</b> can produce self-supporting three-dimensional textile structures, as well as flat work, and is often used ornamentally or decoratively.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>macramé</b> knots. <b>Macramé</b> art also {{includes}} lacings and crossings created when two or more knot segments are joined together. The square knot is considered the simplest knot and the half hitch, {{also known as the}} half knot, is the second most basic knot. These knots are typically used when hemp making hemp jewelry. The half knot produces a spiral cord and the full square knot produces a flat cord. Beads and other decorations are also weaved into the jewelry. Hemp is ideal for this jewelry because it is durable and keeps its shape well.|$|E
