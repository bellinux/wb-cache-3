5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and <b>municipal</b> <b>engineer</b> of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want to}} prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with <b>Municipal</b> <b>Engineer</b> Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E

2500|$|A {{prominent}} 20th century urbanist, Lewis Mumford, severely criticized {{some of the}} grid's characteristics: [...] "With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the <b>municipal</b> <b>engineer</b> could, {{without the}} slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} the <b>Municipal</b> <b>Engineer,</b> John Bennett. [...] It was built during an era of Victorian Revivalism that was then popular in Britain, and its design therefore reflected this architectural style with Italianate windows, {{and it was the}} first such building in Singapore built in this style. [...] The completed town hall originally housed a theatre on the ground floor as well as meeting rooms and offices of various government agencies on the second floor. [...] It also housed the Singapore Library from 1862 to 1876. However, the increase in population resulted in higher demand for entertainment, and the town hall was unable to cope with increasing demand for the use of the building for both entertainment and as administrative purposes, thus by 1893, the offices was moved out of the building.|$|E
2500|$|As {{seen from}} the vilification in Moore's and James' {{comments}} quoted above, the Commissioners came in for as much criticism as the grid itself. Mumford wrote that: [...] "With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the <b>municipal</b> <b>engineer,</b> without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, could [...] "plan" [...] a metropolis..." [...] and Montgomery Schuyler, another architecture critic, claimed that [...] "We all agreed [...] all of us, that is, who pay attention to such things [...] that the Commissioners were public malefactors of high degree." [...] Jean Schopfer, writing in The Architectural Record in 1902, said of them [...] "Men of genius were needed ... Unhappily, they were ... men devoid of all imagination," [...] while historian Thomas Janvier, in his book In Old New York (1894), wrote of the [...] "deplorable results" [...] of [...] "the excellently dull gentlemen", and criticized the plan as only [...] "a grind of money-making."

40|$|Access to a {{sufficient}} amount of safe water is {{taken for granted}} in industrialised nations. Yet, as multiple incidents of contaminated water supplies show, citizens of highly industrialised nations such as Canada may {{not have access to}} safe water—the deadly E. coli outbreak in Waterton, Ontario, being but the most visible among many. <b>Municipal</b> <b>engineers</b> may find themselves between enemy lines as they are asked to assess available data of very different, even incommensurable, types in an evaluation of alternative solutions of access to safe water. Such access also takes into account safety issues such as those concerning the environment and fire hazards. This article reports the results of a ten-year anthropological study of science and municipal engineering in the oftenacrimonious conflict over access to the municipal watermain and safe water in one Canadian community. In the history of the conflict, <b>municipal</b> <b>engineers</b> repeatedly found themselves {{between a rock and a}} hard place, having to evaluate conflicting knowledge claims of qualitative and quantitative nature from quite different sources about the quantity and quality of water available to a part of the community zoned rural area. In considering solutions, the <b>municipal</b> <b>engineers</b> had to take into account oftenconflicting constraints posed by the environment, economy and social justice. Several alternatives are proposed that allow the integration of quantitative and qualitative knowledge in decision making concerning the different safety issues linked to municipal water. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the history of}} the first town engineers in the Transvaal before the Union. It will briefly examine the changes in local government in the Transvaal, focusing on <b>municipal</b> <b>engineers.</b> Examination is made of the selection processes applied in their appointments and the circumstances {{at the end of their}} tenures. It explores what was expected of <b>municipal</b> <b>engineers</b> during this period; shows what their position within the municipal structure was; and explains how vague their job description was in relation to their wide field of operation. The development of the engineer’s position in the municipal management hierarchy is interesting. He was an important figure in local government, had specific responsibilities and enjoyed specific powers. It emerges that most early town engineers had training via apprenticeship for the positions they held and that there was added pressure from elected councillors in municipalities who were prone to assiduously monitor how officials were spending public money.
