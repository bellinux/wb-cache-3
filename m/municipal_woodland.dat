50|$|The year 1848 brought revolution. Mutterschied {{produced}} {{two men who}} took part in the lawmaking bodies that came out of the revolution: Jacob Prinz served in the Prussian National Assembly and Peter Wald I in the Frankfurt Parliament. The municipality helped the poorest with all their strength, for example by selling valuable oak. In 1864, Mutterschied had 480 inhabitants, 308 ha of land and 8 ha of <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> within its limits. In 1868, Mutterschied’s first fire brigade list was drawn up.|$|E
50|$|Kirschroth {{lies in a}} side {{valley of}} the Nahe. Kirschroth’s {{character}} stems from its agricultural heritage, but it is nowadays a state-recognized tourism resort. It sits at an elevation of 260 m above sea level, {{making it one of}} Rhineland-Palatinate’s highest winegrowing villages. The municipal area measures 764 ha, of which 284 ha is wooded (140 ha of this is <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland)</b> and roughly 80 ha is given over to vineyards. The vineyards of the Kirschrother Wildgrafenberg border the village on the north and west.|$|E
50|$|A {{municipal}} forest or <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> is a forest or wood that {{is owned by}} a town or city. Such woods often have a higher density of leisure facilities like play parks, restaurants and cafes, bridleways, cycle paths and footpaths. Unlike an urban forest, which is located largely or entirely within an urban area and may be privately owned, a {{municipal forest}} is publicly owned and may well be outside the city or town to which it belongs. Most urban forests will be municipal forests, but many municipal forests are non-urban.|$|E

50|$|The Catoctin National Recreation Trail is a 26.6 mi (42.4 km) {{hiking trail}} that {{traverses}} federal, state, and <b>municipal</b> <b>woodlands</b> {{along the northern}} half of Catoctin Mountain in Frederick County in central Maryland, USA. The hilly terrain is typical of western Maryland with large sections canopied under dense forest cover.|$|R
50|$|Külz is a rural {{residential}} {{community in}} the Hunsrück whose buildings are somewhat spread out. The municipality lies in the Külzbach valley and has a Landesstraße (State Road) passing through it. The municipal area measures 6.92 km², of which 1.71 km² is covered by <b>municipal</b> <b>woodlands.</b> Külz lies 350 m above sea level, roughly 4 km northwest of Simmern.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, Herschweiler-Pettersheim lies on {{layers of}} lower rotliegend, in {{particular}} the Middle Kusel Group (ruk2), which is made up mainly of sandstones and arkoses along with siltstones, claystones and conglomerates. There are also limestone deposits, which were once quarried at a mine on the Bockhof {{as well as at}} the lime kiln on Landesstraße 350. The lower rotliegend soils are as a rule sandy-loamy to loamy-clayey with clayey-marly bits, as well as being deeply and amply aerated. Thus the plateaux and ﬂat slopes are used as cropland (244 ha), the expanses in the dale and the damp as well as steeper and sunny slopes as hay meadows, grazing land or meadow orchards (all together 179 ha of grassland), and the stony mountain ridges, the pathless, steep slopes and gorges for forestry (95.7 ha <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> and 99.4 ha private woodland). The 437 m-high Hühnerkopf, the predominant peak in the mountain ridge east of the village is a butte formed by a subvolcanic intrusion. The sill formed until 1972 the basis for the local hard-stone industry.|$|E
50|$|Niederalben’s {{appearance}} {{is characterized by}} its topographical location. The street with the newer houses runs parallel to the Steinalb, right near which building was formerly avoided owing to the flooding danger. In the narrow side dales, two centres have formed, called Oberdorf and Unterdorf (“upper village” and “lower village”). Where the two side dales meet stands the old village church. Nearby stands the Evangelical parish hall, which long served as a stand-in church, although the old church has now been properly renovated and now once more fulﬁls its original purpose. The trend towards “modernity” claimed many old farmhouses {{in the rush to}} convert existing properties, often radically, into modern dwellings, but nowadays the trend is more towards striving to preserve older building forms. The municipality has become almost wholly a residential community, a great shift from its former function as a pure farming village. In 1994, the phenological weather station run by the German Weather Service in Offenbach was closed after having existed {{since the end of the}} Second World War. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the municipality had a vast woodland in the Steinalb area that was tended by the municipality’s own forester. This forest, along with a great part of the old municipal area, now belongs to the Baumholder Troop Drilling Ground, a big restricted area, and is now tended by the state forest administration in Baumholder. A forester’s house for the Steinalb area long stood in Niederalben, but this has since been sold. The main farming lands are found on the high plateau on either side of the dale. The greater part of the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> now found in what is left of the municipal area was planted after the Second World War. Within the municipal area lie two nature conservation areas, “Mittagsfels” with its dry grassland and rare ﬂora, and “Steinalbmündung”, a bird conservation area.|$|E
50|$|Schooling {{experienced}} a general upswing {{beginning in the}} time of the Reformation. However, an end would have been put to it no later than the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). About the Nerzweiler school’s beginnings, little is known. It is likely that there was a winter school (a school geared towards an agricultural community’s practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare) in the 18th century. School documents in the Speyer State Archive tell the reader that in 1845, a prospective schoolteacher named Wilhelm Hahn was teaching school lessons at a private dwelling. Hahn was soon asked to ﬁnd a new job, since he was {{to be replaced by a}} schoolteacher who held a diploma. This successor at the Protestant school was Heinrich Engel, born in 1824 in Einöllen, and he was named the regular teacher in 1856. Because the municipality’s ﬁnances were never very strong, there were time and again disputes between the municipality and Engel, and later his successors, over wages and municipal beneﬁts. In 1862, Engel demanded 650 Rhenish guilders that the municipality had not paid him during his time in service. The number of pupils throughout that time was more than ﬁfty in seven grade levels, from a population of somewhat more than 200 (1850/1851: 53; 1851/1852: 56). The municipality had a new schoolhouse built in 1870, and at the same time, it laid out its own graveyard. Because of the ﬁnancial hardship brought about by this, it also sold the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> to the municipality of Aschbach. It is said that this is why Nerzweiler villagers were given the nickname “Kuckuck” (“Cuckoo”, although in German, it seems that this word does not bear the same connotation of madness as in English). Heinrich Engel was in the beginning quite assiduous about his duties, but over time, carelessness and neglect began to show up in his work, perhaps brought about by his meagre wages. In 1877, he had to be pensioned off early after becoming sick. His successor was Jacob Förster from Hinterweidenthal. About him, too, there were soon complaints, and in 1879 he was transferred to Blaubach. Several administrators over the following two years led classes, until Peter Lang was hired in 1881. Lang, who was born in 1848, was actually from Nerzweiler itself. In 1896, he also took on the ofﬁce of computer at the Hundheim-Nerzweiler credit union, but he, likewise, had to seek early retirement owing to illness in 1897. Then, the teaching post was ﬁlled many times over by teachers who only stayed a short time, until from 1912 to 1923 Rudolf Brügel taught. He was transferred to Hütschenhausen in 1923. The village’s last schoolteacher was Armin Hübner. In 1967, the school in Nerzweiler was dissolved. Schoolchildren at ﬁrst had to go to the central school in Sankt Julian, but then later to the primary school-Hauptschule in Offenbach-Hundheim.|$|E
50|$|The countercompony base (that is, {{with two}} rows of squares of {{alternating}} tinctures) is {{a reference to the}} village’s former allegiance to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim, Oberamt of Birkenfeld. The field tincture, vert (green) symbolizes agriculture and forestry. The main charge, the stag’s attires (antlers), stands for the wealth of wildlife in the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodlands.</b> The crown recalls the one found over the door at the old Badisches Amtshaus.|$|R
50|$|In 1819, a {{municipal}} assessment yielded {{the facts that}} Wallenborn had 1,114 head of cattle and 42 residents with entitlement. From 1825 to 1827, Wallenborn dwellers saw their money going to the Bishop in Trier. In 1825, a petition, with every villager’s signature, was presented bearing the wish von Salm loszukommen (“to come loose from Salm”, that is, to separate from the parish). In 1826, the local landowners tried, unsuccessfully, to claim the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodlands</b> as their own.|$|R

50|$|In 1293, Reiffelbach had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention as Rifelbach. At this time, {{one third of}} the tithes were given as a fief by the knight Sir Eberhard of Odenbach to his wife Agnes. In 1321 came the first documentary mention of a chapel in Reiffelbach, belonging to the Order of Malta. In 1370, Reiffelbach was mentioned as Ryffelbach and Riffelbach. In 1387, Reiffelbach was bound to the mill on the Glan in Odenbach, making that mill, as part of the feudal estate, the only one that villagers from Reiffelbach could use. This mill ran until 1938. In the early 15th century, the village’s name appeared in documents in several different forms, among which were Rifelbach (1401), Ryffelbach (1404), Riffelbach (1406) and Rieffelbach (1440). In 1453, the first miners were recorded in neighbouring Odenbach. In 1485, the Reiffelbach church was transferred to the Otterberg Monastery at Meisenheim. In 1510, the village’s name was recorded as ryffelbach. The earliest mention of winegrowing dates from 1516, and this continued for centuries, finally ending in the 1960s. In 1526, the Reformation was introduced into Meisenheim, with its inevitable attendant effect in Reiffelbach, given the ecclesiastical link. In the years leading up to 1600, there was coal mining in Reiffelbach. Dating from 1601 is a boundary stone that was found on the Lehenberg, at the limit with Schmittweiler. In 1667, the village’s name was recorded as Reyffelbach. In 1683, some Franciscans came to Meisenheim. These were the first Catholics to show up in the area since the Reformation. After the Nine Years' War (1688-1697; known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), Reiffelbach’s chapel had fallen into disrepair, {{but it was not until}} 1721 that it was put back in order. Then, it was used by all three faiths, Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In 1724, the village’s name was recorded as Reifelbach. In 1739, some families emigrated. In 1740, new applications were being made for leave to prospect for coal. From 1750 to 1758, there was a glassworks, the Christianshütte, in Reiffelbach which employed 23 workers and made windowglass. Dating from 1776 is another boundary stone that was found in the Scherbelswald (forest). That same year, a homage list was published. In 1786, there were four coal pits being worked in Hollerbach (rural cadastral area). In 1815, as a result of the Congress of Vienna, Reiffelbach found itself in the Oberamt of Meisenheim in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. In 1832, a new schoolhouse was built in the village centre. In 1835, the chapel was torn down and auctioned. In 1846, coal mining occupied 378 ha. In 1849, a new church was built. In 1869, a miners’ association was founded. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, passing troops occupied the village. In 1875, the men’s singing club was founded. In 1885, a new alignment for the road to Roth/Odenbach was laid out. Reiffelbach, Gangloff and Becherbach were beset by a heavy storm. In 1910, the Reiffelbach villager Peter Stein earned the village’s first driving licence. In 1912, the primary school was built. Only two years later, the First World War broke out. After it ended, those men from the village who had fallen or gone missing had their names engraved on the local war memorial. In 1920, electric light made its first appearance in Reiffelbach, while the Hollerbach and Pfarrwiese coal pits were closed; the Abrech I and II pits remained open, however. In 1921, the municipality decided that it was going to keep wild boars and goats, and also that year, a fire brigade was established in which all the village’s men between the ages of 16 and 50 were required to serve. Although electric light was first seen in Reiffelbach in 1920, it was only in 1925 that the village was hooked up to the electrical grid. In 1926, the village’s first threshing machine went into use, threshing the harvest at each of the local farms. The first motorcycle ever seen in Reiffelbach was ridden by villager Eduard Gräff in 1927. In 1929, an almshouse was built, and a postbus route was established from Odenbach by way of Reiffelbach to Dielkirchen. In 1931 the village saw its first reaper-binder go into service. In 1933, Flurbereinigung was undertaken in Reiffelbach by the Flurbereinigungsamt Neustadt (Neustadt Land Consolidation Office), and also in that year, a sporting ground was laid out in the Hartwiesen (this is now tennis courts). From 1934 to 1936, the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodland</b> “In der Muhl” was cleared; today this land is meadows. In 1935, another postbus route was established, this one running from Meisenheim by way of Reiffelbach to Dielkirchen. Despite the years of postbus service that the village had already seen, it was not until 1936 that Reiffelbach had its first car owner. It was the village schoolteacher, Müller. In 1938, the eighth school year was introduced, as was vocational school, which was compulsory. Also compulsory for many was service in the Wehrmacht, which became all too common with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. In 1945, German soldiers - Prussians - retreated through the village on their way to Roth; for a while, an artillery unit was stationed in the “Muhl”, which had been cleared some years earlier. That same year, the war ended and Germany was occupied by the victorious Allies (Reiffelbach found itself in the French zone). Once again, the fallen and missing had their names engraved on the local war memorial. This time also saw some private coal mining at the Hollerbach pit. Yet another postbus route, Landkraftpostlinie II (beginning from Rockenhausen), was instituted in 1948, and also that year, the farmers’ and winegrowers’ association was founded, although winegrowing would only continue in the village for another two decades or so; a conversation club was founded the next year. In 1952, a new, second bell was dedicated at the church, and it was decided that the village would keep a municipal bull. In 1953, the local chapter of the VdK, a social advocacy group, was founded. In 1954, some major work was undertaken on the waterworks, formerly centred at the coal galleries at the Hollerbach pits. There was now a high water cistern to pipe water into houses. Also in 1954, the monument of honour was built at the graveyard. In 1958, the shooting club “Tell” was founded, and the old schoolteacher’s dwelling in the village centre was torn down. The same was done with the schoolhouse itself the following year, and the hunting association was founded. In 1960, the village’s namesake brook, the Reiffelbach, was channelled into an underground pipe, and sewerage was laid in the streets. A new schoolteacher’s dwelling was built in the lower village in 1961. In 1962, the football and sport club FSV Reiffelbach was founded. Also in the early and mid 1960s, a number of measures were undertaken by the forestry office to expand the village’s woodlands. See Land use above. In 1966, a sporting ground was laid out in the Hollerbach, where the shooting club’s clubhouse was also built at about the same time. In 1967, school grade levels 5 to 8 were transferred to the Gemeinschaftsschule (roughly “comprehensive school”) in nearby Meisenheim. In 1968, the “women’s singing circle” was founded. In 1968, the old parish hall in the village centre was torn down. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Reiffelbach was transferred from the Kusel district to the Bad Kreuznach district in 1969. That same year, the church organ was dedicated. In 1970, school grade levels 1 to 4, too, were transferred to Meisenheim, and thereafter the schoolhouse was used as the parish hall. The compulsory-service fire brigade that had been set up in 1921 at last became a volunteer fire brigade in 1971. In 1972, the old schoolhouse was converted into a church hall with kitchen and side rooms. In 1975, a fire brigade promotional association was founded. There was a change in ecclesiastical organization this year, too, one that saw the Evangelical community transferred from the parish of Gangloff to the parish of Odenbach. In 1979, Gangloff was hooked up to the sewage treatment plant in Reiffelbach. In 1981, Reiffelbach was granted the right to bear a coat of arms. The tennis club was founded in 1982. In 1985, a clock was built into the churchtower. In 1987, the village was connected to the Westpfalz (West Palatinate) drinking water supply. Work began in 1990 on a new fire station, and it was dedicated in 1992. In 1993, Reiffelbach celebrated 700 years of existence (at least since the first documentary mention), and a municipal flag was approved for use. Ecclesiastically, Reiffelbach belongs, as it long has, to the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer.|$|E

50|$|Sometime between 1011 and 1018, Archbishop of Mainz Erkambald {{confirmed}} baptism {{and burial}} {{rights for the}} chapel at Klosterkumbd. In 1180, the pious Eberhard von Kumbd (also called Eberhard de Commeda, the last word being a Latinized form of “Kumbd”) built a hermitage on a plot that {{was a gift from}} the Lords of Dyck and led a hermit’s life there. Only three years later, though, he had company after he founded a Cistercian convent at Kumbd with Heinrich von Dyck’s support, and on a plot hitherto owned by him. This institution shaped Kumbd’s history and even gave the village its current name: “Kumbd Convent” is Kloster Kumbd in German, now written as one word, “Klosterkumbd”. In 1196, the convent’s founding was confirmed by Archbishop of Mainz Conrad of Wittelsbach. Landholders through the village’s history were the knightly family von Treis in the 13th century and the Lords of Reifenberg and Schönenberg about 1440. In 1420, Bertram Vogt von Vilwel and his wife Elsa von Reifenberg sold Count Palatine Stephan their one-half share in the Kumbd court. Later the same year, Eberhard von Schönenberg also transferred his one-half share to the Count Palatine. In 1566, Count Palatine Georg von Simmern dissolved the Cistercian convent and subjected it to secular jurisdiction. The nuns remained at the convent, however, living according to the dictates of their order, until the last abbess died in 1574. In 1599 there were nine estate complexes at Klosterkumbd. In 1673, the village passed to Electoral Palatinate. In 1787 the convent woodlands comprised 307 Morgen and the <b>municipal</b> <b>woodlands</b> 50. Beginning in 1794, Klosterkumbd lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it {{has been part of the}} then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.|$|R
50|$|The {{cross in}} chief is a {{reference}} to the village’s former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier.
