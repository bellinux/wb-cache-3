When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: [...] "If anyone had told <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time I was high up on the Nazi blacklist, I should have laughed...

[...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of grabbed <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point and put me on the team." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E

500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it was because I tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Dance" [...] {{was written}} with Hilson {{alongside}} American recording artist Justin Timberlake, {{as well as}} Johnkenum D. Spivery and Timbaland protégés The Royal Court and Jim Beanz. According to Hilson, the songs were first in the works with fellow Timbaland collaborator Justin Timberlake in 2006, during FutureSex/LoveSounds era, but she commented, [...] "it was still unofficial then. The budgets hadn't been opened up for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> stage." [...] Hilson premiered the song at her producer and mentor Jamal [...] "Polow da Don" [...] Jones's launch party his newly created, Interscope-distributed record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007. On choosing singles for In A Perfect World..., {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, Hilson stated, [...] " [...] liked it a lot at first and said it should be a single, but just as that was about to happen he called it 'bubble bath music'. But now he loves it again and thinks it should be a single! He'll really change it up on you." [...] The song went for adds on urban airplay formats on July 21, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E

2500|$|When Washington and {{his troops}} encamped at Valley Forge {{in the winter}} of 1777–1778, Henry {{arranged}} for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called Conway Cabal. Henry supported Washington when Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic about Washington, sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. [...] Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush's handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, [...] "I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and see the white hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
