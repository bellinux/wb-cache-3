Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary black {{commentators}} {{argued that}} to white audiences, Connelly's The Green Pastures simply reinforced {{the notion that}} black people presented a danger {{that needed to be}} contained. Weisenfeld argues that this is also the case with Freleng's parody. To white viewers in the 1930s, the film's implication that blacks care for nothing but gambling, drinking, and dancing only reinforces notions of the dangers posed by urban blacks. According to Goldmark, the choice of performers caricatured is telling; that Armstrong and Calloway are depicted as angels indicates that their crossover appeal was strong enough among whites that white audiences would not have felt threatened by the notion that they were angels in Heaven. Weisenfeld notes that by focusing the narrative on Saint Peter and his Stepin Fetchit underling, the animators ducked the potential offense white audiences <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> upon seeing a black God.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} Jewish {{collaboration}} with the Soviet occupation remains controversial. Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from {{the eastern part of}} the country are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers. Whatever initial enthusiasm for the Soviet occupation Jews <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> was soon dissipated upon feeling the impact of the suppression of Jewish societal modes of life by the occupiers. The tensions between ethnic Poles and Jews as a result of this period has, according to some historians, taken a toll on relations between Poles and Jews throughout the war, creating until this day, an impasse to Polish-Jewish rapprochement.|$|E
25|$|Lamba's highest score 320* {{came in the}} Duleep Trophy Final in 1987-88 for North Zone v West Zone. The West <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> very {{satisfied}} with their first innings score of 444, with their captain and Test opener Anshuman Gaekwad making 216. Their opponents, however, had other ideas and replied with 868 all out. Lamba left Gaekwad in the shade with 320 in 720 minutes which was scored off 471 balls including six 6s and thirty 4s. That season he totalled 1097 runs at 84.38. Seven years later he crossed the triple hundred mark again with 312 for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match versus Himachal Pradesh at Delhi. The hosts ran up 637-3 declared owing much to a first wicket Indian record wicket 464 between Lamba and Ravi Sehgal, who made 216. Lamba's 312 came off 392 balls with two 6s and twenty five 4s and took 567 minutes. These innings and similar knocks, such as his 617 balls 250 for Delhi v Punjab in 1996/97 gained him a somewhat mixed reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Indians stated {{their first}} innings well, with Mankad and Sarwate putting on 124 {{for the first}} wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, {{dismissed}} by Bill Johnston. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by Bruce Dooland, for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by Don Tallon, the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then Adhikari and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> worried.|$|E

500|$|It is {{estimated}} that approximately one-third of the U.S. population <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> the earthquake, {{more than any other}} earthquake in U.S. history. People in certain areas of Pennsylvania, however, did not feel the earthquake at all despite being relatively close to the epicenter. About 148,000 people reported their ground-shaking experiences caused by the earthquake on the USGS [...] "Did You Feel It?" [...] website. Tremors from the Virginia earthquake were felt as far south as Atlanta, Georgia; as far north as Quebec City, Quebec; as far west as Illinois and as far east as Fredericton, New Brunswick, with damage reported as far away as Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
500|$|As for the painting's {{critical}} reception, {{one local}} art reviewer mentioned that [...] "the only thing [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> sheepish about was {{not having a}} staff that in four years could instill in Nelson a better grasp of figure painting". In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was [...] "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting." [...] In his book Arresting Images— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions, Stephen C. Dubin suggested that the painting represented a symbolic castration of Washington, reflecting more [...] "traditional" [...] reactions to African-Americans in positions of power.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussion of Tchaikovsky's {{personal}} life, {{especially his}} sexuality, has perhaps {{been the most}} extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time. It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from Soviet efforts to expunge all references to same-sex attraction and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at armchair analysis by Western biographers. Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual. He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, [...] "associating openly and establishing professional connections with them." [...] However, {{the degree to which}} the composer <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable with his sexual nature has remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer David Brown, [...] "felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape" [...] or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced [...] "no unbearable guilt" [...] over his sexual nature and [...] "eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality... without experiencing any serious psychological damage." [...] Relevant portions of his brother Modest's autobiography, where he tells of the composer's sexual orientation, have been published, as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place where I have been so happy", though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Novelist Brian Lynch, {{writing for}} the Irish Independent found [...] "The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a {{realistic}} fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults", stating [...] "At its best Pure shimmers". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that [...] "Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats" [...] and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, [...] "Miller intimately imagines how it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> to witness it." [...] Holly Kyte found Pure to be [...] "irresistibly compelling" [...] and [...] "Exquisite inside and out". She stated that [...] "Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind" [...] and that she found that [...] "Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities." [...] Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated [...] "Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work" [...] and also noted that [...] "Miller's portraits {{of women and the}} poor are thoughtful and subtle." [...] Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be [...] "very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times" [...] and stated that [...] "Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy." [...] Reviewing for the Daily Mail Clare Colvin stated that the novel [...] "draws you in with hallucinatory power" [...] and that she found that [...] "Miller evokes the underside of Parisian society with assured, vivid detail so that images remain in your mind long after you reach the last page. This is historical fiction with imaginative style." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{timing was}} unfortunate for the Hutchinsons' {{settlement}} in this area. Animosity had grown between the Dutch and the Siwanoy Indians of New Netherland.

However, these Indians rampaged through the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as Kieft's War, and a group of warriors entered the small settlement above Pelham Bay in late August 1643 and killed every member of the Hutchinson household, except for Hutchinson's nine-year-old daughter Susanna.|$|E

30|$|First, it {{is worth}} noting that we focused on group {{interviews}} and discussed teacher attitudes in these group discussions. Although this provided us with a rich set of data, the approach used does have its limitations.

Some teaches <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> ‘save’ enough to express their opinions openly, others <b>might</b> <b>have</b> stayed away for the same reason. Combining group interviews with individual interviews (rather than a questionnaire) might help remedy this limitation in future research.|$|R
50|$|Though Sanchuniathon distinguishes Poseidon {{from his}} Elus/Cronus, {{this might be}} a {{splitting}} off of a particular aspect of Ēl in a euhemeristic account.

2500|$|Eliot {{originally}} considered entitling {{the poem}} He do the Police in Different Voices. In {{the version of}} the poem Eliot brought back from Switzerland, the first two sections of the poem—'The Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess'—appeared under this title. This strange phrase is taken from Charles Dickens' novel Our Mutual Friend, in which the widow Betty Higden says of her adopted foundling son Sloppy, [...] "You mightn't think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices." [...] Some critics use this working title to support the theory that, {{while there are many}} different voices (speakers) in the poem, there is only one central consciousness. What was lost by the rejection of this title Eliot <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> compelled to restore by commenting on the commonalities of his characters in his note about Tiresias, stating that 'What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.' ...|$|E
2500|$|To commemorate {{what would}} have been Gould's 75th birthday, the Canadian Museum of Civilization held an {{exhibition}} titled Glenn Gould: The Sounds of Genius. The multimedia exhibit was held in conjunction with Library and Archives Canada. The exhibition opened September 28, 2007 and looked at five aspects of Gould: [...] "The person," [...] "The musician," [...] "The broadcast personality and producer," [...] "The writer and theorist, composer and conductor," [...] and [...] "The Sounds of Genius". Curator Sam Cronk said [...] "The primary purpose of the exhibition is to remind Canadians of the many facets of Gould's musical genius." [...] John F. Burns of The New York Times reported, in an interview with Herbert Kallmann, that the exhibit will omit many of Gould's eccentricities in favour of highlighting Gould's talent. Of the numerous documents, there are essays, scripts, and music scores. The scores on display were used for some of his most important recordings, marked only for breaks between takes. Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star says that the exhibit will give patrons a feeling {{of what it was like}} at Gould's home: [...] "The cramped space conveys a sense of what his St. Clair Ave. apartment <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> like, with his piano at the very centre of things, along with his low piano chair made by his father." ...|$|E
