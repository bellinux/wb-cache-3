2500|$|In 1914 {{he volunteered}} for the Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment and was given a commission. He served {{on the front lines}} for 46 months and fought in France, Serbia, Slovenia, Italy and Romania. He saw action at the Battle of Verdun, the Battle of Caporetto, the Battle of the Somme, and the Lys Offensive. By his own account he never fired a shot and was never wounded, [...] "though bullets went through <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> coat." [...] Dürckheim {{considered}} his war experience fundamental to his later enlightenment: [...] "I discovered...that it was in facing death that we step forward toward true life. That experience was later a part of my teaching: by accepting death, we discover and receive life which is beyond life and death." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then with {{deliberation}} I opened <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> {{holding out}} the image of Zikali {{as far as the}} chain of elephant hair would allow, I asked, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{rather have}} {{a quarter of an}} hour with John Churchill, on a fair green field, and only a pair of rapiers between <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> his--" ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} Lettie {{was up in the}} spare bedroom, {{arranging}} and adorning, and Rebecca was running with hot-water bottles, and hurrying down with clean bed-clothes. Lettie hastily appropriated my best brushes—which she had given me—and took the suit of pajamas of the thinnest, finest flannel—and discovered a new tooth-brush—and made selections from <b>my</b> <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> handkerchiefs and underclothing—and directed me which suit to lend him. Altogether I was astonished, and perhaps a trifle annoyed, at her extraordinary thoughtfulness and solicitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then their {{making me}} shall be <b>my</b> hair <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> I shall be fitted just as well." [...] Upon {{that they went}} back to Bullhampton, and the Squire told the two ladies what had passed; as to the hair <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> all.|$|R
60|$|I left Jeeves {{to get my}} baggage safely past an {{aggregation}} of suspicious-minded pirates {{who were}} digging for buried treasures among <b>my</b> new <b>shirts,</b> <b>and</b> drove to Gussie's hotel, where I requested the squad of gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him.|$|R
60|$|When I {{had learned}} {{as much as}} has been set down here, I felt a tugging at <b>my</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> knew, without seeing him, that Sergeant Corney {{was not willing to}} remain at this point any longer.|$|E
60|$|While I was {{dressing}} I {{kept trying}} to think who on earth Lady Malvern could be. It wasn't till I had climbed through the top of <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> was reaching out for the studs that I remembered.|$|E
60|$|It was a chill, dismal afternoon, the Heath deserted, a thin rain commencing. I {{slipped off}} <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> jacket, and rolling them under my arm, trotted off alone, hare and hounds {{combined}} in one small carcass, to chase myself sadly by myself.|$|E
6000|$|I rose {{bright and}} early; {{from head to}} foot {{performed}} my ablutions [...] "with Eastern scrupulosity," [...] and I arrayed myself in <b>my</b> red <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> shooting-jacket, and the sportsman's pantaloons; and crowned my entire man with the tarpaulin; so that from this curious combination of clothing, and particularly from <b>my</b> red <b>shirt,</b> I must have looked like a very strange compound indeed: three parts sportsman, and two soldier, to one of the sailor.|$|R
60|$|Once {{she reached}} across {{and felt the}} texture of <b>my</b> coat <b>and</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> remarked upon the good clothes the Yanks wore. My rags good clothes! It put me to the blush; but, on {{inspecting}} them more closely and on examining the clothes worn by the man and woman, I began to feel quite well dressed and respectable.|$|R
5000|$|I name this work, [...] "2011, I exhibit {{myself in}} a western {{exhibition}}": in the exhibition PERSONAL STRUCTURES, {{as part of the}} 54th Biennale di Venezia 2011, I exhibit myself. In the scene, I’m locked in a small, empty room, behind iron “prison” bars. I’m only wearing tailored trousers, being half naked to the waist; <b>my</b> tailored <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> coat are tidy hung on the wall. Every day from 10 am to 7 pm (opening hours of the exhibition at Palazzo Bembo), I stay here, doing nothing. People are free to look at me, a Chinese artist, a Chinese. At 7 pm, I put on <b>my</b> tailored <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> coat and leave my room. People are still free to look at me, I’m still the artwork itself. The next morning, at 10 am, I’ll enter the room again. This action will span 30 days.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I was in <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> {{trousers}} and shouting to Mavovo and the others. Soon they arrived, for as the costume of Mavovo {{and his company}} consisted only of a moocha and a blanket, {{it did not take}} them long to dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{been forced}} to go upstairs and unrind myself, and shake some bees out o' me" [...] said Geoffrey, walking slowly towards the open door, and {{standing}} on the threshold. [...] "The young rascals got into <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> wouldn't be quiet nohow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well done, Corrie. Clamber {{over the}} stern, and slide down by that rope {{into the little}} boat that floats there. Take one of the oars, which you will find muffled, and scull to the shore and bring off Thorwald and his men. And, hark 'ee, boy, bring off <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> boots. Now, look alive; your friend Henry Stuart's life may depend on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant G. Acland Troyte, King's Royal Rifle Corps, 25th Mounted Infantry, states: 'I {{was wounded}} on October 25 in a rearguard action with Colonel Benson's force, near Kaffirstadt. The Boers {{came up and}} {{stripped}} me of everything except <b>my</b> drawers, <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> socks, they gave me an old pair of trousers, and later a coat.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{momentary}} {{silence that followed}} I listened intently, even while I held tightly to my arm. From its feeling my arm seemed to be shot off, {{but it was only}} a flesh-wound. After the first instant of shock I was not scared. But blood flowed fast. Warm, oily, slippery, it ran down inside <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> sleeve <b>and</b> dripped off my fingers.|$|R
6000|$|Alas! I {{knew that}} this was mainly true. Mr. James Barry was an Irishman, whose finer {{religious}} feelings revolted against paying money to a heathen. I could not find it in my heart to say anything to See Yup about the buttons; indeed, I spoke in complimentary terms about the gloss of <b>my</b> <b>shirts,</b> <b>and</b> I think I meekly begged him to come again for my washing. When I went home I expostulated with Mr. Barry, but succeeded only in extracting from him the conviction that I was one of [...] "thim black Republican fellys that worshiped naygurs." [...] I had simply made an enemy of him. But I did not know that, at the same time, I had made a friend of See Yup! ...|$|R
6000|$|I opened <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> by {{the clear}} {{light of the}} flame showed him the image of Zikali which hung about my neck. He stared at it, though touch it he would not. Then {{he stood up and}} lifting his great axe, he saluted the image with the word [...] "Makosi!" [...] the salute that is given to great wizards because they are {{supposed}} to be the home of many spirits.|$|E
60|$|Whatever Dick's {{reply was}} it got drowned in Herky-Jerky's long {{explosion}} of strange language. Herky was plainly glad I {{had not been}} badly hurt. I had already heard mirth, anger, disgust, and fear in his outbreaks, and now relief was added. He stripped off my coat, cut off the bloody sleeve of <b>my</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> washed the wound. It was painful and bled freely, {{but it was not}} much worse than cuts from spikes when playing ball. Herky bound it tightly with a strip of my shirt-sleeve, and over that my handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|In this {{exercise}} I once met an accident, which had {{like to have}} cost me my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; {{the head of the}} pin passing between <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.|$|E
60|$|As for me I did once hire a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} of a friend and took Alice for a drive! More than thirty-five {{years have passed since}} that adventure and yet I can see every turn in that road! I can hear the crackle of <b>my</b> starched <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> the creak of my suspender buckles as I write.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would be fun if, while he was still regenerating, he had to run around and save the world. He's barely out of the box when he realises: I haven't changed <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> yet <b>and</b> I've got 20 minutes to save the world. It's like trying to save the world with flu. And he does it with two minutes to spare." [...] Steven Moffat ...|$|R
60|$|Silently, easily, the brig's sides {{squeezed}} together, {{the deck}} bulged up, and the crushed remnant dropped down and was gone, while {{where she had}} been was occupied by the grinding conflict of the ice-islands. I felt regret at the destruction of this haven against the elements, {{but at the same time}} was well pleased at thought of my snugness inside <b>my</b> four <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> three coats.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day a calf that we had, died. That night I broke its bones, dumped it into {{a coarse}} sack and tied it up with wire. I put on an old shirt, tore a sleeve 'most out of it, and the collar half off, tangled up my hair, put some red ink {{on my hands and}} spashed some of it over <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> face. I must have looked like I'd been having the fight of my life. I put the sack in a wagon and drove out to George's cabin. When I halloed, he came out in a yellow dressing-gown, a Turkish cap and patent leather shoes. George always was a great dresser.|$|E
60|$|About {{eleven o'clock}} {{while the others}} had deserted camp {{temporarily}} for some reason or other, I was lounging upon an odorous bed of pine needles. The sun shone warmly, the sky gleamed bright azure through the openings of the great trees, a dry west breeze murmured through the forest. I was lying on my bed musing idly and watching a yellow woodpecker when suddenly I felt a severe bite on my shoulder. I imagined an ant had bitten me through my shirt. In a moment or so afterward I received, this time on my breast, another bite that left no room for imagination. There {{was some kind of}} an animal inside <b>my</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> one that made a mosquito, black-fly, or flea seem tame.|$|E
60|$|I {{ought to}} have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was a sense in which the man came like an answer to prayer. I had been saying till my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate, and looking till my head ached for any {{possible}} means of separation. Here were the means come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hind-most of my thoughts. It is to be considered, however, that even if the weight of the future were lifted off me by the man's arrival, the present heaved up the more black and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> breeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward like a person shot.|$|E
60|$|Hans groaned audibly, {{but made}} no {{objection}} {{and we started}} with our impedimenta down {{to the edge of}} the estuary where we hid behind a clump of mangrove bushes and tall, feathery reeds. Then I took off some of my clothes, stripping in fact to <b>my</b> flannel <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> the cotton pants I wore, both of which were grey in colour and therefore almost invisible at night.|$|R
5000|$|... "Real Life Funnies" [...] was {{notable for}} its semi-documentary feel: all dialog was culled from Mack's observations, and {{reported}} as [...] "100% Guaranteed Overheard". He said of it: [...] "This job {{gave me an}} excuse to accost people, to be pushy and aggressive. ... I learned to take notes on <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> cuffs <b>and</b> walk backward in crowds. But most of all I learned {{to listen to what}} ordinary people have to say." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon one occasion, even, when woollen rags were scarce, and no burned-brick {{was to be}} {{had from}} the ship's Yeoman, I sacrificed the corners of <b>my</b> woollen <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> used some dentrifice I had, as {{substitutes}} for the rags and burned-brick. The dentrifice operated delightfully, and made the threading of my carronade screw shine and grin again, like a set of false teeth in an eager heiress-hunter's mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{we searched}} him pretty thorough, {{and at last}} we found a paper sewn up in {{the collar of his}} jacket. Sure enough it was a plan. We did not examine it then, for someone might have come along, and we might have been accused of the chap's murder; so I shoved it into the inside pocket of <b>my</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> we went on. We looked at it that night; there was several marks on it and names, one of which we had heard of, though we had never been so far in the Indian country. Well, as you may guess, we had some big talks over it, and at last we {{reckoned}} we would have a try to find it.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked all}} about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing else to his purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of it; where, after I had closed the door, I could not very well avoid joining him. For however this {{extraordinary}} interview might end, it must pass if possible without waking Catriona; {{and the one thing}} needful was that we should sit close and talk low. But I can scarce picture what a pair we made; he in his great coat which the coldness of my chamber made extremely suitable; I shivering in <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> breeks; he with very much the air of a judge; and I (whatever I looked) with very much the feelings {{of a man who has}} heard the last trumpet.|$|E
60|$|So soon as {{they saw}} me they fell to screaming, and clung to one another. Nor did I wonder at their {{distraction}} when I beheld myself {{a few minutes later}} in the glass in my cabin, for my face and hands were blackened with the smoke of the powder, <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> waistcoat were stained with the blood which had poured out from the wound in my head, and around my brow was bound a bloody napkin which I had hastily wrapped about my head so soon as I had recovered from the first effects of my wound. But just then I knew not how I looked, nor reckoned anything of it, for in a fight such as we had passed through one has little time to think of such matters.|$|E
60|$|Having {{shut the}} bag this {{official}} opened the portmanteau, {{and began to}} examine each article {{in a way that}} would have rendered it probable he might have finished sometime within the next twenty-four hours. He slowly turned over <b>my</b> <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> flannels as if he expected to find mines of jewellery in the folds thereof. Suddenly he came on the brass chain and his eye glittered, which was more than the chain did. It had to be re-deposited with a sigh. I began to grow despairing. Presently he took up a book and opened it. Was he going to refresh himself with a chapter? His turning over the leaves very slowly gave reason for the suspicion. Or did the obtuse creature expect to find watches and gun-barrels between the leaves? At last he shut the book, and, laying it down, proceeded to exhume a morning coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Magic armor, forsooth!" [...] cried he at last. [...] "What care I for armor or for magic? I will wager to you"--"my armor," [...] {{he was on}} {{the point}} of saying, but he checked himself in time--"any horse in my stable, that I go in <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> to Scaldmariland, <b>and</b> bring back that mare single-handed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} {{recorded}} using Spector's [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] production technique, cost a then-unheard-of $22,000, and required 21 session musicians and 21 background vocalists. Due to Spector's perfectionism in the studio, he made Turner sing the song {{over and over}} for several hours until {{he felt he had}} the perfect vocal take for the song. Turner recalled, [...] "I must have sung that 500,000 times. I was drenched with sweat. I had to take <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> off <b>and</b> stand there in my bra to sing." ...|$|R
