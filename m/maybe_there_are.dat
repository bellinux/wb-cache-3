If it's something wonderful, I'll do it.' But I don't get anything like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Game {{recorded}} tracks {{based on}} his life experiences from his childhood to his success as a rapper. When asked about the album, he stated: [...] The rapper commented on the album's perception before its release, saying, [...] "I know everybody was expecting gang-bang, 40-ounce, low-rider music, but that's not what I gave them... I'm telling a real story, and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{people out there who}} can relate to my experiences." [...] Rolling Stone observed that [...] "every song has a well-massaged hook and some immediate appeal, and verses that don't waste a lot of time getting to the point." ...|$|E

I could see that happening." [...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that. If Iron Man is flying around doing something, that [...] very costly. And first of all, what’s the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?" ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, Marvel {{announced}} {{a series of}} direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said [...] "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a {{way for us to}} expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features." [...] Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off.

500|$|After {{his death}} Sibelius, though {{remaining}} {{popular with the}} general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as [...] "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity {{about the existence of}} material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked [...] "VIII" [...] within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that [...] "ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just waiting for some scholar to discover them." ...|$|E

We are going into the heart of Arizona, to places where not half-a-dozen white men, even {{counting}} Mexicans as white men, have ever set foot; at least, where not half-a-dozen have ever come back alive from, though <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> hundreds who have tried." ...|$|E

I reckon it's because you're so different from other men; <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> so many different things about you to hook on to, and you don't slip off as easily as the others.

60|$|But, in my opinion, {{the main}} {{condition}} that makes train robbing easy is {{the element of}} surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers. If you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what I mean when I say that the passengers get locoed. That horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world. You can't coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide. It looks as big to him as the Mississippi River. That's just the way with the passenger. He thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside, when <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only two or three. And the muzzle of a forty-five looks like the entrance to a tunnel. The passenger is all right, although he may do mean little tricks, like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to dig-up until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your six-shooter; but there's no harm in him.|$|E
6000|$|Life is a {{thing to}} be lived, not spent, to be faced, not ordered. Life is not a game of chess, the victory to the most knowing; it is a game of cards, one's hand by skill to be made the best of. Is it the wisest who is always the most successful? I think not. The luckiest whist-player I ever came across {{was a man who}} was never QUITE certain what were trumps, and whose most {{frequent}} observation during the game was [...] "I really beg your pardon," [...] addressed to his partner; a remark which generally elicited the reply, [...] "Oh, don't apologize. All's well that ends well." [...] The man I knew who made the most rapid fortune was a builder in the outskirts of Birmingham, who could not write his name, and who, for thirty years of his life, never went to bed sober. I do not say that forgetfulness of trumps should be cultivated by whist-players. I think my builder friend might have been even more successful had he learned to write his name, and had he occasionally--not overdoing it--enjoyed a sober evening. All I wish to impress is, that virtue is not the road to success--of the kind we are dealing with. We must find other reasons for being virtuous; <b>maybe,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some. The truth is, life is a gamble pure and simple, and the rules we lay down for success are akin to the infallible systems with which a certain class of idiot goes armed each season to Monte Carlo. We can play the game with coolness and judgment, decide when to plunge and when to stake small; but to think that wisdom will decide it, is to imagine that we have discovered the law of chance. Let us play the game of life as sportsmen, pocketing our winnings with a smile, leaving our losings with a shrug. Perhaps that is why we have been summoned to the board and the cards dealt round: that we may learn some of the virtues of the good gambler; his self-control, his courage under misfortune, his modesty under the strain of success, his firmness, his alertness, his general indifference to fate. Good lessons these, all of them. If by the game we learn some of them our time on the green earth has not been wasted. If we rise from the table having learned only fretfulness and self-pity I fear it has been.|$|E

Chris {{then goes on to}} explain the theme of the piece, and explains how it leads into imagine and why the perform the two pieces together: “the idea is of it’s a young couple that have been married for a few years and it’s not that fairytale life of happiness. Which happens {{to a lot of people}} - that something goes wrong and tension builds and anger grows within that. And I wanted to put that onto the ice - this raw aggression - and overstate it - so that, for people sitting right the way back, it becomes literal though body. But it follows on in a sort of resolve - not necessarily a happy ending - it then goes into Imagine. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something else, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a compromise or at least an understanding of their situation.
