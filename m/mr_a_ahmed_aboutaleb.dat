50|$|On 22 February 2007, Nebahat Albayrak was {{installed}} as State Secretary (junior minister) for Justice {{in the fourth}} Balkenende cabinet. She and <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> are the first Muslims in a Dutch cabinet. The right-wing Party for Freedom tried to prevent the installation of both Nebahat Albayrak and <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb.</b> The party also tried to pass a {{motion of no confidence}} in parliament directed against all parliamentarians or executive branch politicians with dual citizenship, claiming these politicians have a loyalty conflict or have the appearance of having one. Nebahat Albayrak has a Turkish and a Dutch passport. The motion was rejected by the House of Representatives, since no other party than the Party for Freedom supported it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> (ⴰⵃⵎⴻⴷ ⴰⴱⵓⵟⴰⵍⴻⴱ; أحمد أبو طالب; born August 29, 1961) is a Dutch Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid; PvdA) {{politician}} {{who is the}} Mayor of Rotterdam since January 5, 2009.

Just hours after the shootings, the mayor of Rotterdam, <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb,</b> <b>a</b> Muslim born in Morocco, condemned Islamist extremists living in the West who [...] "turn against freedom" [...] and told them to [...] "fuck off".|$|R

500|$|A lot of Muslim {{critics of}} Wilders {{accuse him of}} using Quranic verses out of context, and of {{manipulating}} verses {{to have a different}} meaning than the verses intended to. Because of Wilders' positions on Islam and calls for discrimination against Dutch citizens of minority ethnic descent, the Dutch–Moroccan rapper Appa, when interviewed about Wilders for a newspaper, said [...] "if someone were to put a bullet in his head, I wouldn't mind". Wilders' views on Islam prompted the Mayor of Rotterdam, <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb,</b> to reprimand him.|$|R

They form a large part of Rotterdam's multi ethnic and multicultural diversity. 50.3% of the population are of non Dutch origins or have at least one parent born outside the country.

5000|$|<b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> {{was born}} on 29 August 1961 in Beni Sidel in Morocco. He grew up as {{a son of a}} Riffian Amazigh Sunni imam in a small village in the Nador Province, Rif region. Together with his mother and {{brothers}} he moved to the Netherlands in 1976, when he was 15 years old. Aboutaleb had already noticed how he differed from other kids. As he says in an interview: 'I was so different, such a school dork. I wanted to learn, I wanted to know everything.' [...] Aboutaleb then studied telecommunications at different schools up to the Hogere Technische School where he obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. 45% of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. Large social groups are people from Surinam, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. Amsterdam is characterized by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. The social tolerance was endangered by the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh on 2 November 2004 by a Mohamed Bouyeri, an Islamic fundamentalist. The mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> formulated <b>a</b> policy of [...] "keeping things together" [...] which involves social dialogue, tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.|$|R
5000|$|The {{triennial}} International Steven Hoogendijk Prize {{for medical}} engineering was first awarded in 2001, shared by three individuals, Professors Nicolas Bom, Jan Somer, {{both from the}} Netherlands and Prof. David Sahn of Portland, Oregon. The subject was pediatric echocardiography. The second award in 2004 was given to Prof. Thomas Sinkjaer from Aalborg, Denmark, recognizing his work on functional electro-stimulation to recover lost neuromuscular founctions of the human body.The third award in 2007 was for Prof. Willi Kalender, from Erlangen, Germany, inventor of the spiral CT scanner. In 2010, the award went to George M. Church, of Harvard Medical School, for [...] "minimal invasive diagnosis" [...] (genome sequencing technology). The award in 2010 was presented by Rotterdam mayor <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> after introductory comments by Prof. H.W. Tilanus (CEO of the Batavian Society) and Frank Grosveld of Erasmus Medical Center and interview by comedian Raoul Heertje.The 2016 prize was awarded to Richard M. Durbin.|$|R
50|$|In February 2007, PVV parliamentarian Fritsma {{introduced}} a motion {{that would have}} prohibited any parliamentarian or executive branch politician from having dual citizenship. The PVV claimed that dual nationals have unclear loyalty. The motion {{would have made it}} difficult, if not impossible for Labour MPs <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb</b> and Nebahat Albayrak to become members of the fourth Balkenende cabinet. The motion had to be withdrawn, however, after objection from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gerdi Verbeet (Labour Party). Maastricht University law professor Twan Tak has commented on the risk in executive branch officials having dual citizenship. however the European Convention on Human Rights as reviewed in 2010 ECtHR jurisprudence has reaffirmed that form of discrimination is a violation of a human right. However, in 2007 the PVV planned to call for a vote of no confidence against junior ministers Aboutaleb and Albayrak when the new cabinet had its first meeting with the House of Representatives, claiming that their respectively Moroccan and Turkish passports put their loyalties into question. In the event, the motion was only supported by the PVV itself.|$|R
50|$|When two Muslim politicians, Nebahat Albayrak and <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Aboutaleb,</b> {{both of whom}} hold foreign as well as Dutch passports, were {{proposed}} as state secretaries in 2007 a discussion was started by the Party for Freedom (PVV) about dual citizenship {{and the possibility of}} foreign citizens to hold office. No other political party joined the PVV in their opinion. After their appointment a motion of no confidence was entered by Geert Wilders, which also did not get any support from any other political party. A week later the PVV entered a motion of no confidence against parliament member Khadija Arib who serves on an advisory council to King Mohammed VI of Morocco; this motion was also defeated without any support from the other parties in parliament. In a country with as many as 2 million residents with dual citizenship, it would prove virtually impossible for any political party to put forward a list of candidates without the odd dual citizen. Even within the PVV itself the policy failed when party representatives turned out to have Turkish and Israeli passports.|$|R

On November 6, 2009, it was announced by Wim van de Donk, the Queen's Commissioner of North Brabant, that Opstelten had accepted the position as Acting Mayor of Tilburg after Mayor Ruud Vreeman's resignation was sought by the City council of Tilburg.|$|R
40|$|It {{had only}} been a few months since <b>Mr</b> Bashir <b>Ahmed,</b> <b>a</b> retired IT Consultant, opened a {{boutique}}. He had {{done a good job}} in setting up the boutique and sourcing the necessary products for it. His business was slowly nudging towards break-even and everything was running smoothly, so he thought. After seven months of work, his salesperson and the only employee, Khawar, left work without prior notice. Mr Bashir decided to sit at the boutique himself until he found a suitable replacement. He was shocked to find all the fraudulent activities and deceptive tactics Khawar had been using right under his nose. There was inventory mismanagement, accounts manipulation and hidden loans on company’s accounts. Mr Bashir is sitting at the boutique and thinking how to fix the issues {{and the best way to}} move forward...|$|R

5000|$|The Pakistan Motorways Police (PMP) {{was raised}} by the Government of Pakistan in 1997 for {{policing}} Pakistan's newly constructed motorway network, starting with the M2. Later, in June 2001, it was also assigned the additional task of patrolling Pakistan's National Highways starting with Pakistan's longest national highway, the N-5. With the assignment of the additional role of patrolling the National Highways, {{the name of the}} Pakistan Motorways Police was changed to [...] "National Highways & Motorway Police." [...] In February 2007, NH&MP started policing the Makran Coastal Highway (N-10). The first Inspector General of Police was Mr. Afzal Ali Shigri and was tasked to prepare the plan for the new force. He was ably assisted by <b>Mr.</b> Shamim <b>Ahmed,</b> <b>a</b> junior officer from the National Transport Research Cell. He conceived, developed and prepared a comprehensive proposal to establish an efficient and modern highway police for the new motorway. With the change of the government the plan was shelved. This plan with slight modifications was established later by Mr. Iftikhar Rashid (Inspector General of Police) who not only implemented the plan but also ensured it achieved the bench marks laid down at its inception.|$|R
