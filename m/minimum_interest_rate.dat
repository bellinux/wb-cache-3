2500|$|In July 2004 former Boeing CEO Harry Stonecipher accused Airbus of abusing a 1992 {{bilateral}} EU-US agreement {{providing for}} disciplines for large civil aircraft support from governments. Airbus is given reimbursable launch investment (RLI), called [...] "launch aid" [...] by the US, from European governments {{with the money}} being paid back with interest plus indefinite royalties, {{but only if the}} aircraft is a commercial success. Airbus contends that this system is fully compliant with the 1992 agreement and WTO rules. The agreement allows up to 33 per cent of the programme cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a <b>minimum</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support. Airbus claims that since the signature of the EU-US agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the present system of intermediation of the German savings surplus, this paper suggests that the risk-adjusted rate of return could be improved by creating a sovereign wealth fund for Germany (designated DESWF), which could invest excess German savings globally. Such a DESWF would offer German savers a secure vehicle paying a guaranteed positive <b>minimum</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> with a top-up when real investment returns allowed. The vehicle would invest the funds in a portfolio that is highly diversified by geography and asset classes. Positive real returns can be expected in the long run based on positive real global growth. Since, in this case, a significant amount of funds would flow outside the euro area, the euro would depreciate, which would help crisis countries presently struggling to revive growth through exports and to close their external deficits so as to recoup their international credit-worthiness. Target imbalances would gradually disappear and German claims abroad would move from nominal claims on the ECB to diversified real and nominal claims on various private and public foreign entities in a variety of asset classes...|$|R

At the threshold rate, the risk adjusted marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost of extending loans. An excess reserves-loan (RL) equationis proposed to link excess reserves and aggregate output. The RL equation is combined with an IS equation, emphasizing the loan rate rather than the government bond rate. Together with a Phillips curve, the model is solved recursively to obtain equilibrium output and price level. The theoretical framework allows us to determine whether the unprecedented expansion of bank reserves by the Federal Reserve will engender inflation, deflation, hyperinflation or a deflationary spiral. The final outcome depends on a linear combination of five parameters and two probability regimes. The empirical results tend to support a deflation instead of an inflation regime...|$|R

40|$|The pricing of {{implicit}} options {{embedded in}} life insurance products is of vital {{importance for the}} insurance industry. Risk management, strategic asset allocation, and product design depend on the correct evaluation of the options sold. Also regulators are interested in such issues since {{they have to be}} aware of the possible scenarios that the overall industry will face with. Our objective is to use a stochastic programming approach to determine the fair price of the options embedded in policy contracts. We provide extensive numerical experiment to describe the behavior of the insurance policies for different setting of the key parameters, market and regulatory constraints. 1 Insurance products with guarantee We focus on insurance contracts whose benefits are linked to a reference fund. The value of the reference fund at time t is It. The insurer funds his initial investment in the reference fund by raising capitals from both policyholders, which pay L 0 = αI 0 as the premium for the contracts, and equityholders, which invest the amount E 0 = (1 − α) I 0 in the company’s asset. Policies are equipped with a minimum guarantee provision, which entitles policyholders to increment over time their premiums according to a <b>minimum</b> guaranteed <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rG, so that at maturity the guaranteed amount is LT = L 0 e rGT.

5000|$|An {{indexed annuity}} (the word equity {{previously}} tied to indexed annuities {{has been removed}} to help prevent the assumption of stock market investing being present in these products) in the United States {{is a type of}} tax-deferred annuity whose credited interest is linked to an equity index [...] - [...] typically the S&P 500 or international index.

40|$|Equity-indexed annuity (EIA) {{insurance}} products {{have become increasingly}} sought after since their introduction in 1995. Some {{of the most important}} characteristics of these products are that they allow the policyholders to benefit from the equity market's potential growth and ensure that the principals can grow with a <b>minimum</b> guaranteed <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In this thesis, we show how to derive the closed-form pricing formula of a point-to-point financial guarantee, using the Black-Scholes framework. Moreover, under the complete-market assumption, we construct a replicating portfolio that can hedge a point-to-point financial guarantee. However, in real financial markets, some of the assumptions required by a complete-market cannot be respected, particularly the continuous-time trading assumption. The replicating portfolio generates hedging errors because companies can only trade discretely. We will show the distribution of the present values of hedging errors for the financial guarantee. We also introduce the Lee-Carter stochastic mortality model. After presenting how to price a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity with fixed mortality rates, we then take the stochastic mortality rates into consideration to re-evaluate the point-to-point. In both cases, the pricing work for the point-to-point product is done under the assumption of independence between the equity market and the policyholder's time of death. Furthermore, the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity can be derived based on the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point financial guarantee with the corresponding mortality rates. The distributions of the present values of hedging errors under both fixed and stochastic mortality rates will be presented. Indeed, the replicating portfolio can help companies reduce the risks of issuing EIA products, since it can hedge the EIA very well.

In this paper we analyze the impact of social information on the interest rate of funded loans and on the credit default risk. While externally determined credit grades strongly influence these outcomes, there is large variation within classes. We hypothesize that potential lenders use social information—including group membership and endorsements from other users—to trust some borrowers more than it is suggested by their credit grade.

By means of a recursive binomial tree à la Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) we compute, first of all, the total price of the contract, which includes also a “bonus ” option. Then this price is split into the value of three components: the basic contract, the bonus option and the surrender option. The numerical implementation of the model allows us to catch some comparative statics properties and to tackle the problem of suitably fixing the contractual parameters in order to obtain the premium computed by insurance companies according to standard actuarial practice. ...|$|E
