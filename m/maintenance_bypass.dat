40|$|Human cancer genomes {{are highly}} complex, making it {{challenging}} to identify specific drivers of cancer growth, progression, and tumor <b>maintenance.</b> To <b>bypass</b> this obstacle, we have applied array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosaroma (ERMS) and utilized cross-species comparison to rapidly identify genomic copy number aberrations and novel candidate oncogenes in human disease. Zebrafish ERMS contain small, focal regions of low-copy amplification. These same regions were commonly amplified in human disease. For example, 16 of 19 chromosomal gains identified in zebrafish ERMS also exhibited focal, low-copy gains in human disease. Genes found in amplified genomic regions were assessed for functional roles in promoting continued tumor growth in human and zebrafish ERMS – identifying critical genes associated with tumor maintenance. Knockdown studies identified important roles for Cyclin D 2 (CCND 2), Homeobox Protein C 6 (HOXC 6) and PlexinA 1 (PLXNA 1) in human ERMS cell proliferation. PLXNA 1 knockdown also enhanced differentiation, reduced migration, and altered anchorage-independent growth. By contrast, chemical inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling reduced angiogenesis and tumor size in ERMS-bearing zebrafish. Importantly, VEGFA expression correlated with poor clinical outcome {{in patients with}} ERMS, implicating inhibitors of the VEGF pathway as a promising therapy for improving patient survival. Our results demonstrate the utility of array CGH and cross-species comparisons to identify candidate oncogenes essential for the pathogenesis of human cancer...|$|R

We propose a new routing scheme that is a hybrid of the current proactive and reactive routing mechanisms.

5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, <b>maintenance</b> of the <b>bypass</b> of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) was {{measured}} in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery (CABS) prior to, during and following cardiopulmonary bypass. CBF fell significantly during hypothermic bypass and returned to prebypass levels {{following the end of}} bypass. At all times CBF, measured as the initial slope index (ISI), was significantly correlated to arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO 2). There was no significant correlation between CBF and changes in arterial blood pressure or, when on bypass, perfusion flow. This supports the notion that CBF autoregulation is maintained during bypass under the conditions of this study. The index of cerebral oxygen supply to demand (CERO 2), which reflects the ratio of oxygen consumed by the brain to that supplied by the cerebral circulation, was appropriately matched prior to and following bypass. During bypass the index fell significantly (p < 0. 001) to levels consistent with a mismatch of flow and demand indicating relative cerebral hyperperfusion. Acid base <b>maintenance</b> during <b>bypass</b> was consistent with a ‘pH stat’ protocol with pH on bypass approximating, following temperature adjustment, to 7. 40. The maintenance of pH stat requires a higher PaCO 2 than does the maintenance of alphastat. It may be that the adoption of an alphastat acid base management protocol, as seen in poikilotherms rather than hibernating mammals, and the resultant reduction in absolute PaCO 2 for any given temperature may result in a lowering of CBF and a return to appropriate matching of CBF and demand during bypass. This may be particularly important in relation to the generation of perfusion related, microembolic, cerebral damage during cardiopulmonary bypass. © 1988, Sage Publications.

40|$|Background:To {{assess the}} impact upon the {{provision}} of a vascular service of the workload associated with maintaining infrainguinal bypass graft patency. Design:A computerised prospective audit. Materials and methods:Between January 1990 and December 1995, all patients with infrainguinal bypass grafts were entered into a prospective computerised audit to monitor interventions {{for the maintenance of}} graft patency. Excluded from the study were interventions during the first 30 postoperative days and procedures not directly related to the graft. A graft surveillance programme was in operation throughout. Results:During the study period a total of 131 patients with 144 grafts were admitted on 330 occasions and required 401 separate interventional procedures. There were 227 procedures in 72 femorodistal grafts, 116 in 38 below-knee femoropopliteal grafts and 58 interventions in the group of 34 above-knee femoropopliteal grafts. Radiological interventions accounted for almost 70 % of this workload. Conclusion:The workload associated with the <b>maintenance</b> of infrainguinal <b>bypass</b> grafts increased considerably during the study period, and seems likely to increase further. Such interventions should therefore be considered when planning for vascular service provision...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCellular {{senescence}} is {{a process}} leading to terminal growth arrest with characteristic morphological features. This process is mediated by telomere-dependent, oncogene-induced and ROS-induced pathways, but persistent DNA damage {{is the most common}} cause. Senescence arrest is mediated by p 16 (INK 4 a) - and p 21 (Cip 1) -dependent pathways both leading to retinoblastoma protein (pRb) activation. p 53 plays a relay role between DNA damage sensing and p 21 (Cip 1) activation. pRb arrests the cell cycle by recruiting proliferation genes to facultative heterochromatin for permanent silencing. Replicative senescence that occurs in hepatocytes in culture and in liver cirrhosis is associated with lack of telomerase activity and results in telomere shortening. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells display inactivating mutations of p 53 and epigenetic silencing of p 16 (INK 4 a).

40|$|Transcription {{inhibition}} by platinum anticancer {{drugs is}} an important component of their mechanism of action. Phenanthriplatin, a cisplatin derivative containing phenanthridine in place of one of the chloride ligands, forms highly potent monofunctional adducts on DNA having a structure and spectrum of anticancer activity distinct from those of the parent drug. Understanding the functional consequences of DNA damage by phenanthriplatin for the normal functions of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), the major cellular transcription machinery component, {{is an important}} step toward elucidating its mechanism of action. In this study, we present the first systematic mechanistic investigation that addresses how a site-specific phenanthriplatin-DNA d(G) monofunctional adduct affects the Pol II elongation and transcriptional fidelity checkpoint steps. Pol II processing of the phenanthriplatin lesion differs significantly from that of the canonical cisplatin-DNA 1, 2 -d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link. A majority of Pol II elongation complexes stall after successful addition of CTP opposite the phenanthriplatin-dG adduct in an error-free manner, with specificity for CTP incorporation being essentially the same as for undamaged dG on the template. A small portion of Pol II undergoes slow, error-prone bypass of the phenanthriplatin-dG lesion, which resembles DNA polymerases that similarly switch from high-fidelity replicative DNA processing (error-free) to low-fidelity translesion DNA synthesis (error-prone) at DNA damage sites. These results provide the first insights into how the Pol II transcription machinery processes the most abundant DNA lesion of the monofunctional phenanthriplatin anticancer drug candidate and enrich our general understanding of Pol II transcription fidelity <b>maintenance,</b> lesion <b>bypass,</b> and transcription-derived mutagenesis. Because of the current interest in monofunctional, DNA-damaging metallodrugs, these results are of likely relevance to a broad spectrum of next-generation anticancer agents being developed by the medicinal inorganic chemistry community.

40|$|Measuring {{sediment}} transport {{is essential for}} a better <b>maintenance</b> of sediment <b>bypass</b> tunnels. Hydrophone, a metal pipe with a microphone, has been installed in some Japanese rivers, and has measured based on counts of pulse caused by hitting sound of gravels. Geophone, thick steel plate, is also indirect measurement technique mainly used in Switzerland by converting plate movement into voltage. However, the hydrophone often underestimate bedload when the pulses are successive and overlap. Although the geophone is robust for measuring coarse sediment, it cannot detect fine sediment. To improve weak points of these two techniques while leaving their advantages, we developed a method to measure bedload transport by a plate microphone. The plate microphone uses a thick plate instead of a pipe, {{which is expected to}} record hitting sounds of fine sediment and also to be robust against hitting by coarse sediment. We examined bedload transport measured by the plate microphone using an artificial flume. The output data is calibrated by number or volume of bedload particles under two conditions (flow velocity and grain size) to understand the effect of these conditions on the bedload estimation...|$|R

40|$|Abundant {{sugarcane}} residue during {{shortage of}} roughage in dry season gives {{an opportunity to}} raise ruminants around sugarcane industries. However, these products are not widely used by farmers due to an assumption that the usage is inefficient and that the feed utilization technology is not widely recognized.

40|$|DinB, the E. coli translesion {{synthesis}} polymerase, {{has been}} shown to bypass several N 2 -alkylguanine adducts in vitro, including N 2 -furfurylguanine, the structural analog of the DNA adduct formed by the antibacterial agent nitrofurazone. Recently, it was demonstrated that the Fe(II) - and a-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB, a DNA repair enzyme, can dealkylate in vitro a series of N 2 -alkyguanines, including N 2 -furfurylguanine. The present study explored, head to head, the in vivo relative contributions of these two DNA <b>maintenance</b> pathways (replicative <b>bypass</b> vs. repair) as they processed a series of structurally varied, biologically relevant N 2 -alkylguanine lesions: N 2 -furfurylguanine (FF), 2 -tetrahydrofuran- 2 -yl-methylguanine (HF), 2 -methylguanine, and 2 -ethylguanine. Each lesion was chemically synthesized and incorporated site-specifically into an M 13 bacteriophage genome, which was then replicated in E. coli cells deficient or proficient for DinB and AlkB (4 strains in total). Biochemical tools were employed to analyze the relative replication efficiencies of the phage (a measure of the bypass efficiency of each lesion) and the base composition at the lesion site after replication (a measure of the mutagenesis profile of each lesion). The main findings were: 1) Among the lesions studied, the bulky FF and HF lesions proved to be strong replication blocks when introduced site-specifically on a single-stranded vector in DinB deficient cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{weight loss}} <b>maintenance</b> after gastric <b>bypass</b> surgery are poorly understood. Our {{aim was to}} examine the effects of gastric bypass on energy expenditure in rats. METHODS: Thirty diet-induced obese male Wistar rats underwent either gastric bypass (n= 14), sham operation ad libitum fed (n= 8) or sham-operation body weight-matched (n= 8). Energy expenditure was measured in an open circuit calorimetry system. RESULTS: Body weight after 70 days was lower after gastric bypass compared to sham ad libitum fed rats (p< 0. 0001). Sham-operated body weight-matched controls ate less than gastric bypass animals to reach the same weight (16. 2 +/- 0. 5 g vs. 27. 5 +/- 0. 8 g, p< 0. 001). Twenty-four hour energy expenditure was increased after gastric bypass (4. 50 +/- 0. 04 kcal/kg/h) compared to sham-operated ad libitum fed (4. 29 +/- 0. 08 kcal/kg/h) and sham-operated body weight-matched controls (3. 98 +/- 0. 10 kcal/kg/h, p< 0. 001). Gastric bypass rats showed higher energy expenditure during the light phase than both sham-operated control groups (sham ad lib: 3. 63 +/- 0. 04 kcal/kg/h vs. sham body weight-matched: 3. 42 +/- 0. 05 kcal/kg/h vs. bypass: 4. 12 +/- 0. 03 kcal/kg/h, p< 0. 001). Diet-induced thermogenesis was elevated after gastric bypass compared to sham-operated body weight-matched controls three hours after a test meal (0. 41 +/- 1. 9 % vs. 10. 5 +/- 2. 0 %, p< 0. 05). The small bowel of gastric bypass rats was 72. 1 % heavier due to hypertrophy compared with sham-operated ad libitum fed rats (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Gastric bypass surgery in rats prevented the expected decrease in energy expenditure subsequent to weight loss. Diet-induced thermogenesis was higher after gastric bypass compared to body weight-matched controls. Raised energy expenditure may be an additional mechanism explaining the physiological basis of weight loss after gastric bypass surgery...|$|R
