50|$|A <b>meridional</b> <b>ray</b> or {{tangential}} ray is a ray that {{is confined}} to the plane containing the system's optical axis and the object point from which the ray originated.|$|E
50|$|The {{marginal}} ray (sometimes {{known as an}} a ray or a marginal axial ray) in an optical system is the <b>meridional</b> <b>ray</b> that starts {{at the point where}} the object crosses the optical axis, and touches the edge of the aperture stop of the system. This ray is useful, because it crosses the optical axis again at the locations where an image will be formed. The distance of the {{marginal ray}} from the optical axis at the locations of the entrance pupil and exit pupil defines the sizes of each pupil (since the pupils are images of the aperture stop).|$|E
50|$|Leaky modes {{correspond}} to leaky rays in the terminology of geometric optics.The propagation of light through optical fibre {{can take place}} via <b>meridional</b> <b>rays</b> or skew rays. These skew rays suffer only partial reflection while <b>meridional</b> <b>rays</b> are completely guided. Thus the modes allowing propagation of skew rays are called leaky modes. Some optical power is lost into clad due to these modes.|$|R
50|$|For larger angles it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to distinguish between <b>meridional</b> <b>rays,</b> which lie in a plane containing the optical axis, and sagittal rays, which do not.|$|R
40|$|Section {{of light}} pipe {{consists}} of separated segments having opposed toroidal mirrors that intercept <b>meridional</b> <b>rays</b> to present virtual wall in space between mirrors, thus insuring uninterrupted light transmission down the pipe. Design affords internal access to pipe section. Segments are electrically or thermally insulated from one another...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} ray or chief ray (sometimes {{known as the}} b ray) in an optical system is the <b>meridional</b> <b>ray</b> that starts {{at the edge of}} the object, and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. As such chief rays are equivalent to the rays in a pinhole camera. The distance between the chief ray and the optical axis at an image location defines the size of the image. The marginal and chief rays together define the Lagrange invariant, which characterizes the throughput or etendue of the optical system. Some authors define a [...] "{{principal ray}}" [...] for each object point. The principal ray starting at a point on the edge of the object may then be called the marginal principal ray.|$|E
40|$|We derive the {{paraxial}} <b>meridional</b> <b>ray</b> tracing equations {{from the}} unified reflection-refraction law using geometric algebra. This unified law {{states that the}} normal vector to the interface is a rotation of the incident ray or of the refracted ray or of the reflected ray by an angle equal to the angle of incidence or of refraction. We obtain the finite <b>meridional</b> <b>ray</b> tracing equations by simply equating the arguments of the exponential rotation operators. We then derive the paraxial limits of these equations {{with the help of}} sign function identities. We show that by embedding the sign functions in the ray tracing equations, we explicitly declare our chosen sign conventions in symbols and not in prose. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{responsivity}} {{of optical}} fibers to refractive index {{can be enhanced}} using high-order skew rays compared with using <b>meridional</b> <b>rays.</b> Skew rays can have a much higher number of reflections with increased interaction length along the core-cladding interface, which gives rise to stronger interactions with the external medium. Reflection/transmission-type refractometric sensors based on twin-coupled-core and multimode fibers showed one/two orders of magnitude increase in responsivity with skew ray excitation. The responsivity and sensitivity for the two types are ~ 2000 %/RIU, ~ 1400 %/RIU, and 4. 9 x 10 ^- 5 RIU, 7. 0 x 10 ^- 5 RIU, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new procedure for calculating the third-order aberration of gradient-index (GRIN) lenses that combines an iterative numerical method with the Hamiltonian theory of aberrations {{in terms of}} two paraxial rays with boundary conditions on general curved end surfaces and, as a second algebraic step has been presented. Application of this new method to a GRIN human is analyzed {{in the framework of}} the bi-elliptical model. The different third-order aberrations are determined, except those that need for their calculation skew rays, because the study is made only for <b>meridional</b> <b>rays...</b>|$|R
40|$|Using a {{computer}} model of a two cylinder electrostatic lens, some novel relationships {{have been found to}} exist between the input and output parameters of <b>meridional</b> <b>rays.</b> These relationships have been developed and used to show that, {{for a wide range of}} practical lens geometries, it is possible to represent all the third and fifth order aberrations in terms of just two of the normal parameters. Formulae have been derived to describe some of the quantities associated with this type of lens defect and the problems of minimising the aberrations are discussed. <p...|$|R
40|$|Full text of {{this item}} is not {{currently}} {{available on the}} LRA. The final published version may be available through the links above. In an optical fibre of circular cross section, leaky skew rays transmit power {{in a different way}} from trapped and <b>meridional</b> <b>rays.</b> In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the evanescent wave absorption coefficient for leaky skew rays in multimode optical fibre evanescent wave absorption sensors is presented. Further, a comprehensive expression for the effective evanescent wave absorption coefficient is obtained. Some numerical results are given to illustrate this theoretical analysis. This work could be applied to optimize the design of fibre-optic evanescent wave absorption sensors...|$|R
40|$|Reflective baffles are {{proposed}} to reject off-axis light entering a telescope. Toroidal surfaces and adjacent cones are positioned so that off-axis rays make multiple reflections {{between these two}} surfaces. <b>Meridional</b> <b>rays</b> are reflected approximately parallel to the entering direction. Skew rays are reflected obliquely, but leave the telescope aperture. The range of incident angles for which these reflections are obtained is approximately 45 deg. A system is described that is designed specifically for the Space Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). Because of its reflective properties, the proposed baffle system rejects about 90 deg of the heat load from the SIRTF sunshade that would be absorbed in systems of conventional black baffles...|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{has been}} performed to track light rays in cylindrical fibres by ray optics. The trapping efficiencies for skew and <b>meridional</b> <b>rays</b> in active fibres and distributions of characteristic quantities for all trapped light rays have been calculated. The simulation provides new results for curved fibres, where the analytical expressions are too complex to be solved. The light losses due to sharp bending of fibres {{are presented as}} a function of the ratio of curvature to fibre radius and bending angle. It is shown that a radius of curvature to fibre radius ratio of greater than 65 results in a loss of less than 10 % with the loss occuring in the initial stage of the bend (at bending angles Phi circa pi/ 8 rad) ...|$|R
40|$|The radiation-induced loss of {{multimode}} step-index fibers with undoped synthetic silica core {{has been}} reduced significantly over the years. Most of the efforts focussed on material modifications and improvements of the undoped core material having either high or low OH-content. With increasing radiation resistance due to core material improvements, influences of the core-cladding interface and of the cladding material became more important. These effects can be analyzed with an improved measurement system using different excitation conditions at the frontface of the step-index fibers: low order <b>meridional</b> <b>rays</b> have high intensity {{in the center of}} the core material and low intensity in the core-cladding transition region, in contrast to high order skew or helix rays having opposite intensity profiles. The measurement system including the specific excitation conditions is described. Applying this setup, radiation-induced losses during and after contiuous gamma irradiation were investigat ed with regard to differences of the specific excitation conditions. The measured values at 10 krad total dose differ by more than a factor of two...|$|R
50|$|The second special {{plane is}} the {{sagittal}} plane. This {{is defined as}} the plane, orthogonal to the tangential plane, which contains the object point being considered and intersects the optical axis at the entrance pupil of the optical system. This plane contains the chief ray, but does not contain the optic axis. It is therefore a skew plane, in other words not a <b>meridional</b> plane. <b>Rays</b> propagating in this plane are called sagittal rays.|$|R
40|$|We used Geometric Algebra {{to compute}} the paths of skew rays in a cylindrical, {{step-index}} multimode optical fiber. To do this, we used the vector addition form for the law of propagation, the exponential of an imaginary vector form for the law of refraction, and the juxtaposed vector product form for the law of reflection. In particular, the exponential forms of the vector rotations enables us {{to take advantage of}} the addition or subtraction of exponential arguments of two rotated vectors in the derivation of the ray tracing invariants in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We showed that the light rays inside the optical fiber trace a polygonal helical path characterized by three invariants that relate successive reflections inside the fiber: the ray path distance, the difference in axial distances, and the difference in the azimuthal angles. We also rederived the known generalized formula for the numerical aperture for skew rays, which simplifies to the standard form for <b>meridional</b> <b>rays.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Background: Some {{previous}} {{researchers have}} shown empirically that visual fields can be restricted by contact lenses with opaque and semi-opaque peripheral zones. However, {{there has been}} no formal statement of the optical theory behind such restriction. Methods: Calculations are made of fields of view with opaque periphery contact lenses, based on paraxial theory and <b>meridional</b> finite <b>ray</b> tracing in the Gullstrand-Emsley schematic eye. Results: This analysis shows that paraxial theory is adequate for predicting 'half fields of full illumination' for ocular pupil diameters smaller than six millimetres, although paraxial estimates of ‘half total field’ can substantially underestimate those obtained by finite ray tracing {{for a wide range of}} ocular pupil sizes. Therefore finite ray tracing may be a more appropriate method of calculating half total field. 'Total field' will be smaller with smaller ocular pupils and smaller contact lens apertures. A clinical method is suggested for assessing total field with such contact lenses in situ. The analysis applied to opaque periphery contact lenses is extended to the semi-opaque periphery contact lenses used for cosmetic alteration of eye appearance. Conclusion: Semi-opaque periphery contact lenses will decrease retinal illuminance most at regions outside those tested by previous empirical static perimetry studies...|$|R
40|$|We use {{the vector}} wedge product in {{geometric}} algebra {{to show that}} Poisson commutator brackets measure preservation of phase space areas. We also use the vector dot product to define the Poisson anticommutator bracket that measures the preservation of phase space angles. We apply these brackets to the paraxial <b>meridional</b> complex height-angle <b>ray</b> vectors that transform via a 2 x 2 matrix, and we show that this transformation preserves areas but not angles in phase space. The Poisson brackets here are {{expressed in terms of}} the coefficients of the ABCD matrix. We also apply these brackets to the distance-height ray vectors measured from the input and output sides of the optical system. We show that these vectors obey a partial Moebius transformation, and that this transformation preserves neither areas nor angles. The Poisson brackets here are expressed in terms of the transverse and longitudinal magnifications. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{techniques have}} {{enabled us to}} record <b>meridional</b> x- <b>ray</b> diffraction patterns from frog sartorius muscle at resolutions ranging from approximately 2, 800 to 38 nm (i. e., overlapping with the optical microscope and the region normally accessible with low angle diffraction cameras). These diffraction patterns represent the transform of the low resolution structure of muscle projected on the sarcomere axis and sampled by its repeat. Altering the sarcomere length results in the sampling of different parts of this transform, which induces changes in the positions and the integrated intensities of the diffraction maxima. This effect {{has been used to}} determine the transform of the mass projection on the muscle axis in a quasicontinuous fashion. The results reveal the existence of maxima arising from long-range periodicities in the structure. Determination of the zeroes in the transforms has been used to obtain phase information from which electron density maps have been calculated. The x-ray diffraction diagrams and the resulting electron density maps show the existence of a series of mass bands, disposed transversely to the sarcomere axis and distributed at regular intervals. A set of these transverse structures is associated with thin filaments, and their 102. 0 -nm repeat suggests a close structural relationship with their known molecular components. A second set, spaced by approximately 230. 0 nm, is also present; from diffraction theory one has to conclude that this repeat simultaneously exists in thick and thin filament regions...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to evaluate the}} light collection of a diffuse light source located {{at the tip of}} an optical fibre. The model is confirmed experimentally and used to evaluate and compare the light collection efficiency of different fibre-coupled luminescence dosimeter probe designs. The model includes contributions from both <b>meridional</b> and skew <b>rays,</b> and considers the light collection from an optically attenuating scintillator. Hence the model enables the optimisation of different, but useful and new probe materials such as BeO ceramic. Four different dosimeter architectures are considered, including previously investigated probe designs; the butt-coupled and reflective wall, along with two novel designs. The novel designs utilise a combination of the scintillating material and transparent media to increase the light collection. Simulations indicate that the novel probes are more efficient in light collection for applications in which it is necessary to minimise the volume of the scintillating material. Alexandre M. C.
