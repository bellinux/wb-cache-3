5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} {{to hold that}} faultless <b>{{mistakes}}</b> <b>of</b> fact justify [...] or, at least, excuse [...] an agent's actions. Less prominent, however, is the view that faultless mistakes about morality similarly come to bear on our attributions of moral blameworthiness. My aim in this dissertation is to defend what I call the symmetry thesis: faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> morality excuse just as do faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> fact. Opposition to this thesis, I think, falls out of an incorrect understanding {{of the way in}} which faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> fact come to bear on our attributions of moral responsibility. Accordingly, much of the dissertation is composed of an analysis of the excusing force <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> fact. Chapter 1 argues that faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> fact are appropriately deemed excused, not justified, by morality and the law. Chapter 2 develops a challenge to what I call the traditional analysis of the excusing force <b>of</b> <b>mistakes.</b> This view holds that an agent's faultless mistake is excusing if, and only if, the mistake undermines, displaces, or, as they say in the criminal law, "negatives" the agent's subjective culpability. I suggest that concerns about voluntariness, not subjective culpability, are in order. Chapter 3 develops an account of voluntariness. I argue that an agent's actions are voluntary enough for an attribution of responsibility only if he did what he is accused of doing because this is something he was willing to do (in the fashion in which it was done) [...] only if, that is, what he did conforms to his will. Chapter 4 then applies this account of the excusing force <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> fact to cases <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> morality. I conclude that an agent is morally blameworthy for his actions only if he believes that what he is doing is wrong, it is true that what he is doing is wrong, and his reasons for so believing properly identify the features of his actions that make them wrong...|$|R

On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E

However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had made the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of}} the Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> not taking Malta.|$|E

5|$|In early April, Dangić {{made the}} <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> {{travelling}} to Serbia, {{where he met}} one of Nedić's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders, and attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly afterwards, Kuntze ordered Dangić's arrest. Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943. The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising, an anti-German rebellion {{which resulted in the}} deaths of 18,000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200,000 Polish civilians.|$|E

At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything.

However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being {{directed against the}} bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis made the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> threatening a mobilization of the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The third {{counter-insurgency}} {{operation in}} Kozara was undertaken {{at the end}} of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and Germans. The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanović had been killed. The Kozara Partisans never repeated the <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> frontal resistance. When stronger enemy forces advanced toward them, they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third counter-insurgency operation, the Ustaše and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanović thought that a significant victory over the enemy would {{be the best way to}} restore the lost support.|$|E
