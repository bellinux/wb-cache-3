40|$|We {{focus on}} a problem {{encountered}} when designing centralized telecommunications networks, namely, the terminal layout problem. Given each terminal's geographical location, the problem consists in creating multipoint lines rooted at a central site (typically a concentrator) {{in order to save}} on connection costs. Well-known <b>multipoint</b> <b>line</b> topologies are the tree, the bus, and the loop. When terminals are assigned a weight representing the average traffic amount exchanged with the central site and lines are constrained by the amount of traffic they can carry, the tree-topology problem {{is referred to as the}} Capacitated Minimum Spanning Tree (CMST) problem. Algorithms that generate solutions for CMST problems create tree structured networks but can also be used to produce bus structured networks by imposing additional constraints. As for the loop topology, the problem is analogous to the Vehicle Routing problem found in Operation Research. These problems are NP-Complete. Finding an optimal solution in an acceptable amount of time is, therefore, unlikely due to the exponential growth in complexity relative to problem size. Nevertheless, techniques yielding exact solutions have been developed but are limited to networks of no more than, say, 50 terminals. Alternatively, heuristics solve the problem to near-optimality with acceptable computational effort. We designed applications with graphical output capabilities for Windows 3. 1 TM using simulated annealing (SA) in an attempt to improve upon well-known heuristic solutions. Our SA programs are presented along with computational results on data sets containing up to 250 terminals. Results are evaluated and compared with those obtained with other heuristic methods...|$|E

5000|$|A {{terminal}} list, {{specified by}} the [...] macro, identified the terminals attached to the line. This macro specified the line characteristics - start-stop, bisync, point-to-point, <b>multipoint,</b> leased <b>line</b> or dial [...] - [...] {{and the type of}} polling required - [...] wrap around or open. The polling characters or telephone number used to identify each specific remote device on the line was coded. The [...] macro could be used to modify information for a specific device in the list during execution. A wrap-around polling list would cause each device in the list to be polled sequentially by the channel until a response was received, This reduced the load on the CPU for continuous polling.|$|R

In this ray-tracing and finite difference time domain (FDTD) techniques are used to consider propagation in the light of changing building techniques. Data from this is seen to agree quite well with measured data available in the literature, and identify propagation mechanisms and characteristics.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{bandwidth}} needed for transmitting the addresses in future symmetric multiprocessor machines (SMP), constructed around a shared bus {{due to the}} critical obligation to preserve the coherence of the memory hierarchy. We show that an address-transaction bandwidth as high as several hundreds of Gbit/s will be necessary not {{to slow down the}} execution of most applications in large SMP's. This communication bandwidth seems incompatible with the operation constraints of shared electrical busses, making necessary the search for other implementations of the address transmission network. We consider the introduction of optical interconnects (OI) in this context. We review several solutions, in the ascending order of complexity of the optical subsystems as one critical issue concerns the degree of sophistication of the optical solutions and their cost. We first consider simple point to point OI's for a SMP chipset. The interest for OI's comes from the low energy consumption and from the possibility, in the future, to integrate several thousands of optical input/outputs per electronic chip. Then we consider the implementation of an optical bus that is a <b>multipoint</b> optical <b>line</b> involving more optical functionality. We discuss the possibility of multiple accesses to the bus, and the constraints related to the necessity to maintain the coherence of caches...|$|R
