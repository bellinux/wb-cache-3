40|$|Problem statement: Two {{methods for}} {{performance}} appraisal that {{are discussed in}} this&# 13; study and they are <b>Management</b> <b>By</b> <b>Objective</b> (MBO) and Assessment Centre techniques. Employees&# 13; are appraised for several reasons, {{the most important of}} which is to realize the best use of human&# 13; resources and to plan for future needs; reward and punishment are secondary. Assessment Centre&# 13; evaluation or appraisal is valuable because it allows a candidate to concentrate on the task at hand. &# 13; Approach: The literature review and arguments were conducted to provide a systematic discussion of&# 13; the study. Results: In <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>Objective</b> performance appraisal, employees are obliged to deal&# 13; with overcoming empirical challenges. In Assessment Centre Appraisal, the different outcomes for&# 13; particular tasks can be evaluated and management can assess employees relative proficiencies in terms&# 13; of these tasks. In both forms, consistency in criteria is crucial, for purposes of comparison and&# 13; standardization. Where comparisons are made with other employees, the criteria need to be parallel for&# 13; employees at similar levels of responsibility. Conclusion: Differences between organizational cultures&# 13; will impact on the way that assessment results are received under MBO performance appraisal as well. &# 13; The outcomes that employees achieve in the tasks provided for appraisal purposes may involve different&# 13; levels of risk, even within firm guidelines. In the assessment centre, the candidate is separated from&# 13; colleagues.
