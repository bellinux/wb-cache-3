By using a <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> <b>system,</b> the surgeon is not exposed to x-rays during the operation because the master tool managed by an operator is located away from the slave tool, which is near the patient. The system must provide vivid realism to the sur-geon, particularly with regard to force information, because this surgery is per-formed in three dimensions while the surgeon watches a two-dimensional mon-itor.

40|$|Bilateral {{teleoperation}} {{is becoming}} one of the far reaching application areas of robotics science. Enabling a human operator the ability to reach and manipulate a remote location will be possible with the various applications of bilateral control. In that sense, ideal bilateral control allows extension of a person's sensing to a remote environment by a master slave structure. So, the coupled goals of bilateral control is to enforce the slave system track the motion generated on the master system and to reflect the forces from the slave system. This thesis investigates {{the current state of the}} art in bilateral teleoperation. For that purpose, design and analysis of bilateral control is made based on the use of disturbance observers. First, a known control structure is investigated in the context of acceleration control. Following this, a case study is made to show a different application of bilateral control, namely grasping force control. Performance improvement in bilateral control is also studied and correspondingly, a novel functional observer is proposed for better estimation of velocity, acceleration and disturbance. In the second half of the thesis, bilateral control with time delay is realized. Design is made via separating the position and force into two different loops. For position control under time delay, a previously proposed control scheme is used in which use of communication disturbance observer with convergence terms was discussed. Observation made about the divergence from the master reference under contact motion is analyzed and a model following control structure is proposed to eliminate the remaining disturbance from the slave plant. For force control under time delay, first the response of a local controller is analyzed. In order to improve the system transparency, a new method is proposed in which environment stiffness was used for force control loop rather than the delayed slave force. In this structure, estimation of environment stiffness was made via an indirect adaptive control scheme. The analyzed structures were also tested experimentally under a <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> consisting of 1 DOF linear motors. Experiments show the validity of the contributions made for bilateral control with and without time delay...|$|E
