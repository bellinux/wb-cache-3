50|$|Operation Chastity {{would have}} seen the {{construction}} of floating piers in the pool, allowing large ships to tie up alongside, with bridges to carry the cargo and troops to the shore. The plan was berths for offloading five ships simultaneously, providing a capability of 2,500 tons of supplies per day directly onto vehicles. A further 7,500 tons per day could be offloaded using lighters carrying supplies directly to the shore from 30 further ships moored in the pool. This was seen as a very efficient scheme, since the two Mulberry prefabricated ports constructed on the Normandy beaches provided 6,000 tons of supplies a day at a construction cost of 120,000 <b>man-months,</b> whilst Operation Chastity facility would provide 10,000 tons per day (compared to 26,000 tons per day through the Normandy beaches and Cherbourg) but would only need 4,000 <b>man-months</b> to construct the prefabricated facilities. A further advantage was the ready access to local rail facilities and the relatively undamaged rail network away from the Normandy region.|$|R

50|$|A {{major reason}} for the compiler's {{portability}} lay in its structure. It was split into two parts: the front end parsed the source and generated O-code for a virtual machine, and the back end took the O-code and translated it into the code for the target machine. Only 1/5 of the compiler's code needed to be rewritten to support a new machine, a task that usually took between 2 and 5 <b>man-months.</b> This approach became common practice later, e.g., Pascal or Java, but the Richards BCPL compiler {{was the first to}} define a virtual machine for this purpose.|$|R
