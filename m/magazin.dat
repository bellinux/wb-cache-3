5|$|In 1778, {{he went to}} Germany to take a {{teaching}} position as a Natural History professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel, where he met Therese Heyne, the daughter of classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. She later {{became one of the}} first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the Enlightenment, including Lessing, Herder, Wieland and Goethe. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal Göttingisches <b>Magazin</b> der Wissenschaften und Litteratur. Forster's closest friend, Samuel Thomas von Sömmering, arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the Rosicrucians in Kassel.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} work of Samuel, however, was in Bible exegesis. As early a writer as Abū al-Walīd (Kitāb al-Luma‘, p.15) {{called him a}} leading advocate of simple, temperate explanation ("peshaṭ"), and Abraham ibn Ezra, although finding fault with his verbosity, placed him in the front rank of Bible commentators of the geonic period (see Bacher, Abraham ibn Ezra's Einleitung zu Seinem Pentateuch-Commentar, etc., p.18). In modern times his significance as a Bible exegete has been given proper appreciation through Harkavy's studies of the manuscripts in the St. Petersburg Library (see Berliner's <b>Magazin,</b> v. 14 et seq., 57 et seq.; Harkavy, l.c. i., iii.; Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. xx. 132 et seq.).|$|E
25|$|Although {{little of}} his entomological work was {{published}} by Róndani himself, it raised him to preeminence. In 1840, he {{became a member of}} the Academy of France, published his first paper, and corresponded with Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville on insects of Sicilian amber. Further publications rapidly followed on species new to Italy, new to science, plans of classifications, taxonomic arguments, and initial work on the his masterwork, the Prodomo, a treatise on Diptera. Many were (confusingly) printed locally at the printing office in Parma, but then, following amendments in the entomological journals Nuovi Annali di Scienze Naturali di Bologna, <b>Magazin</b> de Zoologie de M. J. Guérin Ménéville, and the Annales de la Société Entomologique de France.|$|E
60|$|DEAR JOE,--... I {{have had}} a {{handsome}} success, in one way, here. I left New York under a sort of half promise to furnish to the Harper magazines 30,000 words this year. <b>Magazining</b> is difficult work because every third page represents 2 pages that you have put in the fire; (because you are nearly sure to start wrong twice) {{and so when you}} have finished an article and are willing to let it go to print it represents only 10 cents a word instead of 30.|$|R

Flexibility in reading means increased speed as well as enhanced comprehension: an efficient re­ ader should read fast with needed comprehension. A poor reader is one who reacts everything slowly without getting much meaning from reading.  The article focuses on techniques for developing foreign language reading skills of university students to cape with the reading of English technical texts...|$|R
5000|$|Khan {{was born}} on 24 November 1904 in Belua, Gopalpur, Tangail, Bengal Presidency, British Raj. His father Nayeb Ali Khan was a local landlord. In 1920 he {{graduated}} from Hemnagar High School {{and the next year}} he joined Ripon College, Calcutta. During his time in Kolkata he met Surya Sen, Kazi Nazrul Islam and others. He worked the rights of peasants in Bengal. He graduated from Ripon college in 1924. He campaigned against landlords, and published the magazine [...] "Sarbahara". He published two more <b>magazins</b> afterwards called Chashi-Majur and Din-Majur. He finished in BA in 1926 and MA in 1928 from Calcutta University.|$|R
25|$|From 1835 to 1838 he {{published}} textbooks on geometry and mechanics, largely {{a reaction to}} his former research assistant Bernt Michael Holmboe's textbooks. Compared to Holmboe's method of teaching, Hansteen's books were more practically oriented. After Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} first textbook for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it, a public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Holmboe's textbooks proved more lasting, with Hansteen's textbook not being reprinted. In 1842 Hansteen wrote his Disquisitiones de mutationibus, quas patitur momentum acus magneticae. He also contributed various papers to different scientific journals, especially <b>Magazin</b> for Naturvidenskaberne.|$|E
25|$|Working as a {{lecturer}} from 1814, in 1816 Hansteen {{was promoted to}} professor of astronomy and applied mathematics. He was {{the editor of the}} official Norwegian almanac from 1815, manager of the city astronomical observatory from the same year and co-director of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (then known as Norges Geografiske Oppmåling) from 1817. In 1819 he published a volume of researches on terrestrial magnetism, which was translated into German under the title of Untersuchungen über den Magnetismus der Erde, with a supplement containing Beobachtungen der Abweichung und Neigung der Magnetnadel and an atlas. By the rules there framed for the observation of magnetical phenomena Hansteen hoped to accumulate analyses for determining the number and position of the s of the Earth. In 1822 he co-founded Norway's first journal on natural sciences, <b>Magazin</b> for Naturvidenskaberne. He sat as editor-in-chief for eight years.|$|E
25|$|In November, Anatol E. Baconsky was reelected to the Writers' Union Committee, and, in 1969, his Remember {{was awarded}} Steaua 's annual prize. He visited the Hungarian capital Budapest, invited {{by the local}} branch of the International PEN. Late in 1969, he {{published}} the poetry volume Cadavre în vid ("Thermoformed Dead Bodies"), which was granted the 1970 Award by the Writers' Union. Also in 1970, his Echinoxul nebunilor was translated into German by Austrian author Max Demeter Peyfuss, being released in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland. The Romanian writer attended the event in Vienna, before leaving for Paris. The following year, he traveled to West Germany and again to Austria. Over the following three years, these visits were depicted by Baconsky in his permanent column at the journal <b>Magazin.</b> He also published his first volume {{on the art of}} Romania—a monograph dedicated to and named after painter Dimitrie Ghiaţă.|$|E

The on-line open-loop system combines in-line and off-line analytical measurement procedures including data acquisition and evaluation as well as analytical laboratory organisation {{under the control of}} a computer-supported laboratory automation system. In-line measurements are performed for. density, volume and temperature in processtanks and registration of samples for offline measurements. Off-line computer-coupled experiments are potentiometric titration, gas chromatography and x-ray fluorescence analysis. Organisational sections like sample registration, <b>magazining,</b> distribution and identification, multiple data assignment and especially calibrations of analytical devices are performed by the data processing system...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} {{microsystems}} {{is characterized by}} a demand for customized products with an associated multitude of variants with low piece numbers. To reduce the high production costs arising from this, a kit system for micro-systems will be presented. In this way, cost advantages can also be achieved by miniaturizing conventional products. In order to successfully penetrate the market for microsystem technology, small and mid-sized companies {{need to be able to}} act flexibly. At the same time, the provision of suitable production systems is a pre-requisite for using microsystem technology on marketable products. To enable a flexible, automated industrial production, there is a need not only for extendable modular production systems which can be combined, but also for innovative manufacturing techniques. This article describes developments in the <b>magazining,</b> identification, handling, assembly and cleaning of microsystems...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1840s the {{appearance}} of rival illustrated magazines forced the Pfennig-Magazin to adapt itself to changes in consumer taste. The journal carried beneath its main title the sub-title [...] "für Belehrung und Unterhaltung" [...] ("For instruction and entertainment"). Starting in January 1843 a longer sub-title was added: [...] "Wir glauben dem Zweck unseres <b>Magazins,</b> gemeinnützige Kenntnisse zu verbreiten, dahingehend erweitern zu müssen, daß dies nicht mehr, wie bisher blos in der Form der Belehrung, sondern so weit es möglich ist, auch in der Form der Unterhaltung geschehe." [...] ("We believe it is axiomatic that the objective of our magazine, to disseminate shared practical knowledge, must be broadened, so {{that it no longer}} crudely didactic, but also enhances the entertainment side of things.") Nevertheless, after 1847 circulation declined, and the Pfennig-Magazin ceased publication in 1855.|$|R
25|$|Some of N. D. Cocea's {{writings}} {{enjoyed a}} good standing throughout Romania's communist period. During the early 1960s, official textbooks {{described him as}} one of those who covered the gap between 19th-century Realism and Romanian Socialist Realism. In particular, the communist regime overplayed Cocea's criticism of the Romanian monarchy, glorifying him as someone who had undermined the credibility of Michael I and his predecessors. In one instance, communist historiography even claimed that Cocea and Arghezi had served time for their 1912 anti-monarchy campaign, taking Facla lampoons at face value. Cocea's World War II diaries were passed on to his relatives in Switzerland, and have not been published except for the short fragments hosted in the 1960s by two Romanian reviews: <b>Magazin</b> Istoric and Secolul XX. In 1970, an edition of his Jurnal ("Diary") was issued by the PCR's Editura Politică. A previously unknown novel by Cocea was signaled in the late 1970s, and noted for its virulent attacks on Pamfil Șeicaru.|$|E
25|$|The early nineties {{were a very}} chaotic, but {{exciting}} and optimistic era in terms of comics. Because no one was told {{what is and is}} not to be published, many saw great opportunities in releasing comics. In these years a large variety of comics came into the country (not as direct import, but in the form of translations): all kinds of European, American comics. Although most companies were full of enthusiasm, but only few were strong in capital. In the meantime, the whole newspaper and magazine distribution system went through major changes, leaving magazines in a worse situation. Magazine print numbers dropped by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, most of them disappeared after a few months or years. By 1992 such great series as Menő Manó (Italian comics for teenage readers), Krampusz (Italian comics for adult readers), Hepiend <b>Magazin</b> (Conan, Punisher), Vampi (European and American horror, fantasy, erotic comics) vanished. Besides the inexperience of the small publishing companies, the comics-reading audience might not have been ready for these type of comics. In many cases their true value was only discovered in recent years.|$|E
