40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the existence, status and description of the so-called emergent phenomena believed to occur in certain principally planar electronic systems. In fact, two distinctly different if inseparable tasks are accomplished. First, a rigorous mathematical model is proposed of emergent character, which is conceptually bonded with Quantum Mechanics while apparently non-derivable from the many-body Schrödinger equation. I call the resulting conceptual framework the <b>Mesoscopic</b> <b>Mechanics</b> (MeM). Its formulation is space-independent and comprises a nonlinear and holistic extension of the free electron model. Secondly, the question of relevancy of the proposed "emergent mechanics" to the actually observed phenomena is discussed. In particular, I postulate a probabilistic interpretation, and indicate how the theory could be applied and verified by experiment. The <b>Mesoscopic</b> <b>Mechanics</b> proposed here has been deduced from the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory (NMT) [...] a classical in character nonlinear field theory. This latter theory has already been shown to provide a consistent phenomenological model of such phenomena as superconductivity, charge stripes, magnetic vortex lattice, and magnetic oscillations. The NMT, which arose from geometric considerations, has long been awaiting an explanation as to its ties with the fundamental principles. I believe the MeM provides at least a partial explanation to this effect. Comment: 20 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} single-particle {{model is}} introduced, which captures the characteristic of {{systems in the}} quantum Hall regime. The model entails the magnetic Shrödinger equation with spatially variable magnetic flux density. The distribution of flux is prescribed via the postulates of the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>mechanics</b> (MeM) introduced in my previous articles [cf. J. Phys. Chem. Solids, 65 (2004), 1507 - 1515; J. Geom. Phys., Vol. 55 / 1 (2005), 1 - 18]. The model is found to imply exact integer and fractional quantization of the Hall conductance. In fact, Hall resistance {{is found to be}} R_H = h/ 2 e^ 2 M/N at the filling factor value N/M. The assumed geometry of the Hall plate is rectangular. Special properties of the magnetic Shrödinger equation with the mesoscopic feedback loop allow us to demonstrate quantization of Hall resistance as a direct consequence of charge and flux quantization. I believe results presented here shed light at the overall status of the MeM in quantum physics, confirming its validity. Comment: 10 page...|$|E
40|$|On a {{mesoscopic}} level, {{high performance}} concrete (HPC) {{was assumed to}} be a heterogeneous composite material consisting of aggregates, mortar, and pores. The concrete mesoscopic structure model had been established based on CT image reconstruction. By combining this model with continuum mechanics, damage mechanics, and fracture mechanics, a relatively complete system for concrete <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>mechanics</b> analysis was established to simulate the process of early-age shrinkage cracking in HPC. This process was based on the dispersion crack model. The results indicated that the interface between the aggregate and mortar was the crack point caused by shrinkage cracks in HPC. The locations of early-age shrinkage cracks in HPC were associated with the spacing {{and the size of the}} aggregate particle. However, the shrinkage deformation size of the mortar was related to the scope of concrete cracking and was independent of the crack position. Whereas lower water to cement ratios can improve the early strength of concrete, this ratio cannot control early-age shrinkage cracks in HPC...|$|E

The major obstacle is lacking of insights into fundamental physical laws underlying fractal mesostructures of soft matter.

40|$|The <b>Mesoscopic</b> <b>Mechanics</b> (MeM), as {{introduced}} in [5], {{is relevant to}} the electron gas confined to two spatial dimensions. It predicts a special way of collective response of correlated electrons to the external magnetic field. The dynamic variable of this theory is a finite-dimensional operator, which is required to satisfy the mesoscopic Schrödinger equation, cf. (2) below. In this article, we describe general solutions of the mesoscopic Schrödinger equation. Our approach is specific to the problem at hand. It relies on the unique structure of the equation and makes no reference to any other techniques, {{with the exception of}} the geometry of unitary groups. In conclusion, a surprising fact comes to light. Namely, the mesoscopic dynamics “filters” through the (microscopic) Schrödinger dynamics as the latter turns out to be a clearly separable part, in fact an autonomous factor, of the evolution. This is a desirable result also from the physical standpoint. 1 A brief description of contents and results The mesoscopic Schrödinger equation describes evolution of an operator (denote...|$|E

A kind of spring-slipper model is introduced to reflect the elastic-plastic damage behavior. Uniaxial test was operated, combined with the Computerized Tomography test of concrete, to study the evolution of crack surface from mesoscopic level to macroscopic level. And the rationality of fractal damage constitutive law was verified with their theoretical calculation result and test results.

40|$|Fatigue {{fracture}} of bridge stay-cables {{is usually a}} multiscale process as the crack grows from micro-scale to macro-scale. Such a process, however, is highly uncertain. In {{order to make a}} rational prediction of the residual life of bridge cables, a probabilistic fatigue approach is proposed, based on a comprehensive vehicle load model, finite element analysis and multiscaling and <b>mesoscopic</b> fracture <b>mechanics.</b> Uncertainties in both material properties and external loads are considered. The proposed method is demonstrated through the fatigue life prediction of cables of the Runyang Cable-Stayed Bridge in China, and it is found that cables along the bridge spans may have significantly different fatigue lives, and due to the variability, some of them may have shorter lives than those as expected from the design...|$|R

40|$|Grouting {{technology}} has been widely used in all fields of geotechnical and civil engineering. Prospective engineering objectives including reinforcement of rock mass and groundwater leakage treatment {{can be achieved by}} grouting which will change the mechanical parameters of rock mass such as strength, elastic modulus, and coefficient of permeability. In this paper, rock mass is assumed as a composite material consisting of rock particles and random microcracks initially. Since part or all of the cracks will be filled with cement slurry after grouting, rock mass consists of rock particles, grout condensate, and some or no random microcracks after grouting. The damage constitutional law of the mesoscopic element is established based on the theory of <b>mesoscopic</b> damage <b>mechanics.</b> With the heterogeneity of the components of rock mass considered, the variation of mechanical characteristics of rock mass is studied before and after grouting. And the influence mechanism of grouting on rock mass is investigated at mesoscale level...|$|R

The fractional quantum underlies fractal mesostructures and many-body interactions of macromolecules in soft matter and is experimentally testable. The frequency scaling power law of fractional order appears universal in physical behaviors of soft matter (1 - 5) and is considered “anomalous ” {{compared with those of}} the ideal solids and fluids. For instance, Jonscher (4) concluded that a fractional frequency power law was “the universal dielectric response ” in soft matter.

40|$|A {{framework}} for modeling controlled plastic flow through grain boundaries using a continuum plasticity theory, phenomenological <b>mesoscopic</b> field dislocation <b>mechanics</b> (PMFDM), {{is presented in}} this article. The developed tool is {{used to analyze the}} effect of different classes of constraints to plastic flow through grain boundaries, as it relates to dislocation microstructure development and mechanical response of a bicrystal. It is found {{that in the case of}} low misorientation angle between adjacent grains, impenetrable grain boundaries cause significant work hardening as compared to penetrable grain boundaries due to the accumulation of excess dislocations along them. However, a penetrable grain boundary with a high misorientation angle effectively behaves as an impenetrable boundary, with respect to the stress-strain response...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze and}} depict {{complicated}} fluid behaviours in fractured porous media with various permeable material matrix across different scales, an Enhanced Heterogeneous Porous Media Computational Model is proposed based on Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). LBM is widely employed to model basic fluid dynamics within disordered structures {{due to its}} powerful applicability to <b>mesoscopic</b> fluid <b>mechanics</b> and its potential performance of parallel computing. This paper combines with the force model, statistical material physics and the parallel algorithm to effectively describe the feature changes while fluid passes through the fractured porous media with diverse permeable material matrix of high resolution by using supercomputers. As an application example, a 3 D sandstone sample is reconstructed with 36 million grids using the scanned CT images and characterized with different feature values at each lattice grid to distinguish pores, impermeable solids and permeable material matrix by stating its local physical property. The calculation and comparison results with the conventional LBM are discussed to demonstrate the advantages of our method in modeling complicated flow phenomena in fractured porous media with variable permeable material matrix across different scales, and its sound computing performance that keeps the parallel speedup linearly {{with the number of}} processors...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} {{model of}} plasticity, Phenomenological <b>Mesoscopic</b> Field Dislocation <b>Mechanics</b> (PMFDM), {{is used to}} study the effect of surface passivation, grain orientation, grain boundary constraints, and film thickness on the mechanical response of multicrystalline thin films. The numerical experiments {{presented in this paper}} show that a surface passivation layer on thin films introduces thickness dependence of the mechanical response. However, the effect of passivation decreases in films with impenetrable grain boundaries. The orientation of individual grains of the multicrystal also has a significant effect on the mechanical response. Our results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. A primary contribution of this work is the implementation of a jump condition that enables the modeling of important limits of grain boundary constraints to plastic flow, independent of ad-hoc constitutive assumptions and interface conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{reaction}} (but, more generally, fluctuations and dissipation) {{occurs when}} a system interacts with a heat bath, a particular case being the interaction of an electron with the radiation field.

40|$|This work {{involves}} the modeling {{and understanding of}} mechanical behavior of crystalline materials using a continuum approach, Phenomenological <b>Mesoscopic</b> Field Dislocation <b>Mechanics</b> (PMFDM; Acharya and Roy, 2006). Specifically, this thesis contains three major parts. The first part {{involves the}} modeling of some aspects of dislocation sources that represent the emission of dislocation dipoles. The developed strategy is then used to investigate the dependence of mechanical response on the external dimensions of idealized single crystalline cubical samples with varying source and initial excess dislocation density distribution. The second part involves the modeling of plastic flow through grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. The model is then used to analyze dislocation microstructure development in polycrystalline thin films {{and its effect on}} the mechanical response. The effect of thickness and the presence/absence of surface passivation on the plastic deformation of thin films is also studied. Results from these simulations are found to be in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. The last part involves the numerical implementation of finite deformation PMFDM theory.

40|$|The {{scanning}} tunnelling microscope (STM) {{relies on}} localized electron tunnelling between a sharp probe tip and a conducting sample to attain atomic-scale spatial resolution. In the 25 -year period since its invention, the STM has helped uncover {{a wealth of}} phenomena in diverse physical systems -— ranging from semiconductors to superconductors to atomic and molecular nanosystems. A severe limitation in scanning tunnelling microscopy is the low temporal resolution, originating from the diminished high-frequency response of the tunnel current readout circuitry. Here we overcome this limitation by measuring the reflection from a resonant inductor–capacitor circuit in which the tunnel junction is embedded, and demonstrate electronic bandwidths as high as 10 MHz. This ~ 100 -fold bandwidth improvement {{on the state of}} the art translates into fast surface topography as well as delicate measurements in <b>mesoscopic</b> electronics and <b>mechanics.</b> Broadband noise measurements across the tunnel junction using this radio-frequency STM have allowed us to perform thermometry at the nanometre scale. Furthermore, we have detected high-frequency mechanical motion with a sensitivity approaching ~ 15 fm Hz^(- 1 / 2). This sensitivity is on par with the highest available from nanoscale optical and electrical displacement detection techniques, and the radio-frequency STM is expected to be capable of quantum-limited position measurements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first part explores a 2 -d edge dislocation model to demonstrate characteristics of Field Dislocation Mechanics (FDM) in modeling single and collective behavior of individual dislocations. The second work explores the possibility of modelling adiabatic shear bands propagation within the timespace averaged framework of <b>Mesoscopic</b> Field Dislocation <b>Mechanics</b> (MFDM). It is demonstrated that FDM reduces the study of a significant class of problems of discrete dislocation dynamics to questions of the modern theory of continuum plasticity. The explored questions include {{the existence of a}} Peierls stress in translationally-invariant media, dislocation annihilation, dislocation dissociation, finite-speed-of-propagation effects of elastic waves vis-a-vis dynamic dislocation fields, supersonic dislocation motion, and short-slip duration in rupture dynamics. A variety of dislocation pile-up problems are studied, primarily complementary to what can be dealt by existing classical pile-up models. In addition, the model suggests the possibility that the tip of a shear band can be modelled as a localized spatial gradient of elastic distortion with the dislocation density tensor in continuum dislocation mechanics; It is demonstrated that the localization can be moved by its theoretical driving force and forms a diffuse traveling band tip, thereby extending the thin layer of the deformation band. A 3 -d, parallel finite element framework of MFDM is developed in a geometrically nonlinear context for the purpose of modelling shear bands. The numerical formulations and algorithm are presented in detail.
