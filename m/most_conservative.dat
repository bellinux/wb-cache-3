5|$|In his {{decade in}} Congress, McEwen {{compiled}} a conservative voting record, usually scoring {{in the single}} digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85% or higher in the American Conservative Union's similar polls, though McEwen was never one of the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> Republicans in the House nor the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> Republican in the Ohio delegation.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Several {{organizations}} {{have attempted to}} measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journals 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being <b>most</b> <b>conservative.</b> National Journals subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Union Bank of Switzerland {{entered the}} 1990s {{as the largest}} and <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> of the three large Swiss Banks. The bank's {{investments}} {{had been in the}} conservative asset management and life insurance businesses; further, 60% of the bank's profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{and modern}} historians {{provided}} different estimations {{for the number}} of ships and troops under the command of Basiliscus, {{as well as for the}} expenses of the expedition. Both were enormous; Nicephorus Gregoras speaks of one hundred thousand ships, the more reliable Cedrenus says that the fleet that attacked Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, having each one hundred men on board. The <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Sherman {{began to take}} {{a larger role in}} politics. In 1844, he {{addressed}} a political rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. As with <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} of the Liberal Party to adopt, at its last convention, the legalization of prostitution as an official policy, did not become an issue during the election. Legalization was strongly opposed by <b>most</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and many Liberals, but supported by the NDP.|$|R
50|$|The local section, less doctrinaire {{than its}} Colombian parent, {{included}} {{most of the}} new nation's white minority, and was led by Manuel Amador Guerrero who served as the republic's first President.

50|$|White {{broke with}} <b>most</b> <b>conservatives</b> and {{remained}} loyal to President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., against Ronald Reagan {{in the contest}} for the 1976 Republican nomination. Once in the White House in 1981, President Reagan named White {{as the director of}} Radio Marti, which broadcast pro-U.S. programming to communist Cuba.|$|R
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, {{which resulted in a}} hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by <b>most</b> <b>Conservative</b> MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{served on}} the Court for nearly thirty years, during which time he espoused a {{conservative}} jurisprudence and ideology, advocating textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation. He was a strong defender of {{the powers of the}} executive branch, believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas. He supported the death penalty and opposed abortion, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, as well as most policies that afforded equal or special status to minority groups, earning {{a reputation as one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language.|$|E
50|$|The diocese officially {{subscribes to}} the {{traditional}} Anglican stance on homosexuality. <b>Most</b> <b>conservatives</b> and Evangelicals remain opposed to the blessing of same-sex unions and the ordination of non-celibate gay and lesbian clergy. Some liberal people, such as laywoman Muriel Porter, have been very vocal in their support {{for changes in the}} church's attitudes towards homosexuality.|$|R

50|$|<b>Most</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{strongly}} opposed the gun registry, {{while the other}} parties generally supported it. The Conservatives promised to scrap the long-gun registry (handguns and restricted firearms would remain registered) and introduce tougher gun-related crime laws, including minimum sentencing for gun crimes. A few Liberal backbenchers had spoken against the registry; however, they were overwhelmed by the party support.|$|R
5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first {{years on the}} Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état (Lithuanian: 1926-ųjų perversmas) was a {{military}} coup d'état in Lithuania {{that resulted in the}} replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona. The coup took place on 17 December 1926 and was largely organized by the military; Smetona's role remains the subject of debate. The coup brought the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> party at the time, to power. Before 1926, it had been a fairly new and insignificant nationalistic party: in 1926, its membership numbered about 2,000 and it had won only three seats in the parliamentary elections. The Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, the largest party in the Seimas at the time, collaborated with the military and provided constitutional legitimacy to the coup, but did not accept any major posts in the new government and withdrew in May 1927. After the military handed power over to the civilian government, it ceased playing a direct role in political life.|$|E

25|$|The Nationalist side {{included}} the Carlists and Alfonsists, Spanish nationalists, the fascist Falange, and <b>most</b> <b>conservatives</b> and monarchist liberals. Virtually all Nationalist groups had strong Catholic convictions {{and supported the}} native Spanish clergy. The Nationals {{included the}} majority of the Catholic clergy and practitioners (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army, most large landowners, and many businessmen.|$|R

5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, {{but today the}} language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state of}} Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.|$|E
5|$|Canning's {{views on}} the Catholic Question were not well {{received}} by the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs. Canning died later in that year, leaving Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, to lead the tenuous Tory-Whig coalition. Lord Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by the Duke of Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable. George was never as friendly with Wellington {{as he had been}} with Canning and chose to annoy the Duke by pretending to have fought at Waterloo disguised as a German general. With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the Duke of Cumberland, the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned en masse on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power. Royal Assent was finally granted to the Catholic Relief Act on 13 April.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by <b>most</b> <b>Conservative</b> and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2011, Geymann {{introduced}} House Resolution 27, a measure intended to halt the state from using one-time money, such as cash {{from the sale of}} prisons, to underwrite ongoing government operations. The practice is common in state government though long opposed by <b>most</b> <b>conservatives.</b> The change, known as the Geymann Rule, will require a two-thirds vote to pass state budget bills.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a trusted}} figure in Melbourne {{business}} circles and shared the dissatisfaction that <b>most</b> <b>conservatives</b> {{felt at the}} increasingly erratic and autocratic way Hughes ran the government. He also disliked Hughes personally and felt that Hughes had not acknowledged his efforts as Acting Prime Minister. Although he remained loyal in public, he was keen to leave Hughes's ministry, and was {{seen by many as}} Hughes's likely successor.|$|R
50|$|The centrist and the {{conservative}} parties bitterly confronted {{each other in the}} ensuing legislative elections for many decades, until metapolitefsi. After the metapolitefsi of 1974, the leftist-socialist movement supplanted the centrists and took the main part of their electorate. A smaller part of erstwhile centrists, along with <b>most</b> <b>conservatives,</b> affiliated themselves with the centre-right New Democracy party, which self-defined as a liberal party and drafted the republican Constitution of 1975.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} say how he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the American Conservative Union named Price {{one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>conservative</b> {{members of}} Congress, giving him a 100% {{approval}} rating.

The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|R
