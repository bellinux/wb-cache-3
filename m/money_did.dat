25|$|Development of the {{banknote}} {{began in}} the Tang Dynasty during the 7th century, with local issues of paper currency, although true paper <b>money</b> <b>did</b> not appear until the 11th century, during the Song Dynasty. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.|$|E
25|$|In 1838 {{plans were}} drawn {{up for a}} more {{elaborate}} network of coastal fortifications. <b>Money</b> <b>did</b> not permit all of the batteries to be established, but work was begun on the Queens Battery, located {{at the site of}} the regatta ground on the Queens Domain. The battery was set back by delays and funding problems, and was not completed until 1864 having taken more than 24 years.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the war in July 1921, the IRA was {{hard-pressed by}} the {{deployment}} of more British troops into the most active areas and a chronic shortage of arms and ammunition. It has been estimated that the IRA had only about 3,000 rifles (mostly captured from the British) during the war, with a larger number of shotguns and pistols. An ambitious plan to buy arms from Italy in 1921 collapsed when the <b>money</b> <b>did</b> not reach the arms dealers. Towards {{the end of the}} war, some Thompson submachine guns were imported from the United States; however 450 of these were intercepted by the American authorities and the remainder only reached Ireland shortly before the Truce.|$|E

25|$|Monetarism {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} down inflation, {{but at the}} cost of unemployment rates in excess of 10%, causing the deepest recession seen in the developed countries {{since the end of the}} Great Depression and severe debt crises in the developing world. Contrary to monetarist predictions, the relationship between the money supply and the price level proved unreliable in the short- to medium-term. Another monetarist prediction not borne out in practice was that the velocity of <b>money</b> <b>did</b> not remain constant, in fact it dropped sharply. The US Federal Reserve began increasing the money supply above monetarist-advised thresholds with no effect on inflation, and discarded monetarism in 1984. The Bank of England likewise abandoned its sterling M3 money targeting in October 1985.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that <b>money</b> <b>did</b> not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E
500|$|In late 1910, the new {{government}} introduced legislation to revoke the A's charter and confiscate the proceeds {{from the sale of}} bonds, which were still held by the province. [...] In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated. [...] Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the <b>money</b> <b>did</b> not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis. [...] Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A had defaulted on any of its obligations, and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'." ...|$|E

500|$|Now {{wanting a}} [...] "bigger and stronger-looking" [...] Jason, {{one that was}} also [...] "more {{athletic}} and powerful", Steve Miner hired former British trapeze artist Richard Brooker. After a simple conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that [...] "playing a psychopathic killer" [...] {{was the best way}} into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, [...] "It felt great with the mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn't have anything to wear before that." [...] For The Final Chapter, Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a [...] "real hardcore stuntman"; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the <b>money,</b> <b>did</b> [...] "get into the Jason psychology" [...] when he arrived on the set. White {{went so far as to}} not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star Judie Aronson, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with Friday the 13th Part 2, there was confusion over who performed the role in A New Beginning, partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and made sure he [...] "really got into the character".|$|E

2500|$|Logan {{was born}} in Richland Township, Tama County, Iowa in 1867. His mother died in 1876, and his brothers, Hank, Johnny and Lonny, moved to Dodson, Missouri {{to live with their}} aunt Lee Logan. Until at least 1883, Harvey made his living {{breaking}} horses on the Cross L ranch, near Rising Star, Texas. While there, he met and befriended a man named [...] "Flat Nose" [...] George Curry, from whom he took his new last name. His brothers soon adopted the same last name. The Logan brothers were known as hard workers until they got paid. <b>Money</b> <b>did</b> not stay in their pockets for long. They all had a taste for alcohol and women. Kid Curry would often return from a train or bank robbery, get drunk and lay up with prostitutes until his share of the take was gone. After Kid Curry became famous, the prostitutes would frequently name him as the father when they became pregnant. The children were referred to as [...] "Curry Kids". It is believed that Kid Curry was credited with as many as eighty-five children, though the number of children he actually fathered was probably fewer than five. Descendants of the [...] "Curry Kids" [...] remain scattered throughout Eastland County, Texas and the surrounding areas to this day.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a trustee}} has broken a duty {{owed to the}} trust, there are three main remedies. First, {{specific}} performance may generally be awarded {{in cases where the}} beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to [...] "account" [...] for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a right to see the trust accounts are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and [...] "falsified" [...] to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains). In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given £1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to hold for a loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The <b>money</b> <b>did</b> reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply. Similarly in Swindle v Harrison a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her negligent and dishonest advice about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty.|$|E
