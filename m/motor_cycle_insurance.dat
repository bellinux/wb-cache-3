50|$|The Classic <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> is a UK {{motorcycle}} magazine originally {{launched in}} 1981 with six editions {{a year as}} a spin-off from UK newspaper-format <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> Weekly (previously historically known as The <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle)</b> as under then Editor-in-Chief Mick Woollett at IPC, Surrey House, Sutton, Surrey.|$|R
50|$|Publisher IPC {{decided the}} time was right to {{establish}} in 1981 a completely new magazine, The Classic <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle,</b> reminiscent of their early historic publication named The <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle,</b> to address the increasing public interest and popularity of classic motorcycles. Complete operational control was given to Currie in Birmingham, although overall responsibility remained at head-office in Sutton, Surrey, with former <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> Weekly editor Mick Woollett as Editor-in-Chief. In 1983, IPC sold The Classic <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> to EMAP along with the <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> and <b>Motor</b> Cycling archives, with Currie retained as editor based in Birmingham but with an assistant editor now at the Peterborough base of EMAP.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, after a 10-year {{demise of}} British {{motorcycle}} manufacturing, Currie showed an increasing {{interest in the}} vintage and classic era, establishing a regular feature in <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> Weekly (as <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> was then known) named 'Past Times'. <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> had merged with Motor Cycling in 1967, so their combined archives were available to Currie.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRAK Transportation System is {{used for}} moving people and materials. One of its {{components}} is means of transportation, such as, vehicles, <b>motor</b> <b>cycle,</b> etc. At present, motorcycle dominate Semarang traffics. On the feasibility analysis of transportation project, either economical and financeal analysis, one of the data needed is Vehicle Cost Analysis (VCA) which passes the roads. However the study of VCA <b>motor</b> <b>cycles</b> is rarely done. The purposes of this research are to identify {{the factors that influence}} VCA, to analysis VCA and to find out the suitable VCA model in Semarang area. In collecting the data, quisionaires are distributed to the <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> drivers, such as: students colleges, lectures, employees of college around Tembalang campus, and also the people of Banyumanik region. The questions are : the type, the capacity and the year of <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> assembling, the amount of journey per week, oil consumption, frequency of service, tube and tyre changing, <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> is price, the speed average of <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> journey, over head cost per month,and spareparts per year. The data is compiled and analyses including two means for the influence factors of VCA and the regression model of the factors that influence the journey. The research concludes that VCA consists of fixed costs (price, tax, re-sale cost) and variable cost (fuel, service, oil, tube and tyre, overhead cost, and spare parts cost). The variable cost of <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> inverses to the year of its assembling, it means that the newer the <b>motor</b> <b>cycle,</b> the lower the variable cost. VCA of the <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> is not influenced by its type, its machine capacity, the year of its assembling and tube and tyre changing. The variable cost of <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> sun km in Semarang area is about Rp. 312, 00 to Rp. 478, 0...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{reducing}} {{emissions of}} the harmful gases that {{generated in the}} combustion process of the automobile and other internal combustion engine is absolutely essential to environmental preservation. These emissions pollute the environment {{and contribute to the}} global warming, acid rain, smog, odours, and respiratory and other health problems. Therefore many countries around the world are taking major efforts to toughen emission standards. <b>Motor</b> <b>cycles,</b> the lagers amount, contributed the major air pollution in Indonesia. The hamful gases that generated in the <b>motor</b> <b>cycles</b> especially CO, HC and NOx. As the <b>motor</b> <b>cycles</b> is getting older, many components in the combustion system are getting worst and contribute more hamfull emissions. This research was done on July 2001 to find out the emissions and was done on Honda Astrea Grand which have been used since 1995, 1996 dan 1997 on the variety of gear level. A multigas analyser was used to analyse the emission gas out form the tile pipe.  The result shows that the maximum CO and HC emission are generated by all <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> on the first gear.
