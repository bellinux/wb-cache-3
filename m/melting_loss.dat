40|$|Partial melting {{significantly}} weakens crustal rocks {{by introducing}} a low-viscosity liquid phase. However, near-concomitant melt drainage can remove this weak phase, potentially reversing the rheological effects {{such that the}} strength of a specific lithology depends on when the prograde pressure-temperature path intersects a melting reaction, how much melt is produced, and how long this melt is retained before it is lost. Phase equilibria and mixed rheology modeling of typical metapelite and metagreywacke compositions indicate that these rocks undergo continuous but pulsed melt production during prograde metamorphism. Depending on whether melt removal is continuous or episodic, and assuming geological strain rates, the lithologies can retain a very low strength less than 1 [*]MPa or transiently strengthen to ∼ 5 MPa following <b>melt</b> <b>loss.</b> Lithologies undergoing episodic <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> can therefore cycle between being relatively weak and relatively strong components within a composite crustal section. Melt production, retention, and weakening in the middle to lower crust as a whole is more sustained during heating and melt production, consistent with geodynamic inferences of weak, melt-bearing lower crust. However, the long-term consequence of <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> is a 50 – 400 % increase in the strength of residual lithologies. The strengthening is more pronounced in metapelite than metagreywacke and is achieved through a combination of dehydration and the removal of the weak mica framework coupled to increased proportions of strong feldspars and garnet.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIDisequilibrium melting {{has been}} {{established}} as a common process occurring during crustal anatexis and thus demonstrates that crustal assimilation is not a closed system. Observations of extreme compositional heterogeneity within partial melts derived from crustal xenoliths have been documented in several recent examples, however, the retention or transfer of elements to and from residues and glasses, and their relative contributions to potential crustal contaminants warrants further investigation. Recent eruptive products of the Huoshaoshan volcano in the Holocene Wudalianchi volcanic field of Northeast China contain crustal xenoliths which preserve a spectrum of partial melting both petrographically and geochemically, thus providing an excellent, natural example of crustal anatexis. Correlations exist between the volume of silicic glass preserved within the xenoliths and bulk rock SiO 2 (70 - 83 wt. %), Al 2 O 3 (8 - 16 wt. %), glass Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (0. 715 - 0. 908), abundances of elements common in feldspars and micas (Sr, Ba, Rb) and elements common in accessory minerals (Y, Zr, Nb). These correlations are likely associated with the consumption of feldspars and micas and the varying retention of accessory phases during partial melting. The xenoliths which contain greater volumes of silicic glass and residual quartz (interpreted as being the most melted) were found within pahoehoe lava, whilst the least melted xenoliths were found within scoria of the summit cone of Huoshaoshan; thus it is interpreted that the extent of melting {{is linked to the}} immersion time in the lava, which we estimate to be on the order of days. However, the least partially melted samples display geochemical evidence in support of <b>melt</b> <b>loss,</b> evidenced by the relatively depleted nature of their whole rock compositions and the larger difference between whole rock and glass. Yet the more melted samples appear to have experienced less <b>melt</b> <b>loss.</b> Thus the extent of melting cannot be linked linearly to the volume of <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> which occurs. Small-scale (mm) mingling and transfer of material from the enclosing lava to the xenolith are observed, however, modelling of potential contaminant compositions is inconsistent with crustal contamination during lava petrogenesis. It is thus more likely that any crustal contamination in these eruptives is extremely localized within this open magmatic system and most likely occurs at the contact zone between the xenolith and host lava.

Case studies are presented from four high thermal gradient terranes: the Windmill Islands in Wilkes Land, east Antarctica; the central Aileron Province in central Australia, the Rayner Complex in east Antarctica and the southern Gawler Craton in South Australia. The Windmill Islands region records two stages of high thermal gradient metamorphism between c. 1320 – 1300 Ma and c. 1240 – 1170 Ma. The first stage of metamorphism occurred at conditions of 3. 5 – 4 kbar and 700 – 730 ºC and was associated with the formation of a horizontal fabric. The second stage of metamorphism is most strongly recorded in the southern Windmill Islands where it reached conditions of ~ 4 kbar and 850 ºC, coincident with the emplacement of voluminous isotopically juvenile granitic and charnockitic magmas. The metasedimentary rocks of the Windmill Islands contain both arc- and craton-derived detrital zircon grains, suggesting that they formed in a back-arc setting. An extensional setting is consistent with the high thermal gradients and the formation of a regional horizontal fabric during the first stage of metamorphism. The intrusion of juvenile charnockite further suggests that the overall tectonic regime was extensional and that the crust beneath the Windmill Islands contained little evolved material. The central Aileron Province records long-lived high thermal gradient anatectic conditions between c. 1590 and 1520 Ma. Peak temperatures were in excess of 850 ºC with pressures of 6. 5 – 7. 5 kbar, corresponding to a thermal gradient of > 130 – 140 ºC/kbar. The retrograde evolution involved minor decompression and then slow cooling, culminating with the development of andalusite. The absence of any syn-metamorphic magmatism and the development of contractional structures during metamorphism suggest that long-lived high thermal gradient metamorphism was likely to have been driven to a significant extent by the burial of high heat producing pre-metamorphic granitic rocks that volumetrically dominate the terrane. The Rayner Complex in east Antarctica was extensively deformed and metamorphosed during the Rayner Orogeny between c. 1020 and 900 Ma. Metamorphism was associated with voluminous granitic and charnockitic magmatism. The earliest phase of metamorphism is recorded in the southern Rayner Complex and involved pressures of > 7. 5 kbar. Pervasive metamorphism at 950 – 900 Ma affected the whole Rayner Complex and involved temperatures of 850 – 880 °C and lower pressures of 6 – 7 kbar. The Rayner Complex is interpreted to be a back-arc basin that was closed during two-stage collision between the Archean Antarctic cratons to the south and the arc, followed by collision with the Indian Craton. High thermal gradient metamorphism can occur in both collisional and extensional regimes and in both plate margins and intracontinental settings. The primary thermal driver in the Windmill Islands and the Rayner Complex was likely to have been the thinned lithosphere resulting from back-arc extension, whereas in the central Aileron Province, the primary thermal driver was likely to be anomalously high heat producing crust. However, in all three terranes, the attainment of regional high temperatures was facilitated by the preconditioning (dehydration) of the crust by prior <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> events and slow erosion rates. In all four studied terranes, high thermal gradient metamorphism resulted in <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> that significantly altered the compositions and reactivity of the residual rocks. One implication of <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> during regional high temperature metamorphism is that it creates a terrane comprising anhydrous, residual rock compositions that are relatively resistant to reworking during subsequent metamorphic events. As demonstration of this, the Rayner Complex records a metamorphic event at c. 540 – 500 Ma that reached peak conditions of 800 – 870 °C and 5. 5 – 6. 5 kbar. However, high-T mineral growth at 540 – 500 Ma is only recorded in some locations. The spatial distribution of this mineralogical reworking was controlled by localised rock reactivity that may reflect domains that had undergone hydrous retrogression {{at the end of the}} Rayner Orogeny, locally enhancing the responsiveness of the rock mass during the Cambrian. In the southern Gawler Craton, forward modelling of an Fe-rich phyllite sequence shows that <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> can also have economic implications by increasing the concentration of iron in the residual rock package, leading to enrichment in Fe-oxide minerals (magnetite and hematite). Muscovite-rich rocks with lower iron content are more fertile, produce more melt and therefore show a more significant increase (up to 35 %) in the Fe-oxide content in the residual (melt depleted) rock package. Rocks with primary Fe-rich compositions are less fertile, lose less melt and therefore do not experience the same relative increase in the amount of Fe-oxides in the residuum. The economic implications of the modelling are that the more fertile horizons with lower primary iron contents may be significantly upgraded as a result of <b>melt</b> <b>loss,</b> thereby improving the overall grade of the ore system. In the case of southern Gawler Craton, melt loss-driven Fe enrichment has contributed to the formation of one of Australia’s largest known magnetite resource systems. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In situ partial melting of metagabbroic rocks produced patches and sheets of coarse-grained plagioclase-rich leucosome containing euhedral peritectic clinopyroxene.

This research focus on one of the least researched direct recycling method that is by cold compression. Only one optimum chip size was used, that is (4 - 6) mm x (3. 5 - 4. 5) mm x (1. 45 - 1. 55) mm. The chips were cold compressed with a Force (F) of 35, 40 and 45 tons with variable in Holding Time (t = 1, 5 and 10 minutes). The compressed samples were then placed into the furnace to be sintered at different Temperature (T) namely, 0 °C (no sintering), 500 °C and 600 °C. Both the mechanical properties (Ultimate Tensile Strength, UTS and Elongation to Failure, ETF) and the physical properties (Density, D and Micro-hardness, MH) were then tested. Response surface methodology (RSM) was then applied to identify the optimal variable parameters for specific goals. It was found that an increased in the compression force above the optimum condition will not bring any significant outcome on the compressed specimen. Whereas, sintering process increases the UTS to maximum of 14. 67 MPa at sintering temperature of 600 °C. But at the same time, the specimen that was sintered at 600 °C show low ETF of only 1. 23 %. As for specimen that were not sintered (0 °C), the lowest recorded UTS is 2. 77 MPa but having better microhardness that was even higher if compared to the reference specimen with microhardness of 117. 10 HV. Even though there is an improvement in mechanical and physical properties but the microstructure of the sample reveal that there is lack of bonding in the structure as the chips were more to overlapping each other rather than inter-locking one another.

Petrographic observations and variations of fluid mobile elements (such as Ba, Sr, U, and Re) are consistent with seawater interaction in {{the upper part of}} the core. Nevertheless, major and trace element indicators of the extent of melt depletion indicate extreme <b>melt</b> <b>loss,</b> and suggest that these are amongst the most depleted abyssal peridotites recovered thus far.

40|$|Abstract: Regional {{metamorphism}} {{occurs in}} plate boundary zones. Accretionary orogenic systems form at subduction boundaries {{in the absence}} of continent collision, whereas collisional orogenic systems form where ocean basins close and subduction steps back and flips (arc collisions), simply steps back and continues with the same polarity (block and terrane collisions) or ultimately ceases (continental collisions). As a result, collisional orogenic systems may be superimposed on accretionary orogenic systems. Metamorphism associated with orogenesis pro-vides a mineral record that may be inverted to yield apparent thermal gradients for different meta-morphic belts, which in turn may be used to infer tectonic setting. Potentially, peak mineral assemblages are robust recorders of metamorphic P and T, particularly at high P–T conditions, because prograde dehydration and <b>melting</b> with <b>melt</b> <b>loss</b> produce nominally anhydrous mineral assemblages that are difficult to retrogress or overprint without fluid influx.

This study also reveals that the X Al values in the residual felsic-metapelitic, high-pressure granulites could be significantly reduced by a high proportion of <b>melt</b> <b>loss.</b> We suggest that orthopyroxene-bearing, high-pressure granulites occur in residual overthickened crustal basement under continental subduction-collision zones and arc-continent collision belts. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In addition to modelling of pressure-temperature pseudosections, compositions of garnet core composition, garnet rim- ternary feldspar-kyanite-quartz equilibrium, ternary feldspar composition, and the garnet- biotite equilibrium provide five constraints that were used to constrain the pressure- temperature path from eclogite through the granulite and amphibolite facies.

In this study, we investigate the influence of impurities from the crucible on efficiency losses in mc silicon solar cells, focusing on the limitation due to iron. The applicability of p-type mc silicon, crystallized in G 1 sized crucibles of industrial material quality and very pure electrically fused silica, for a high-efficiency solar cell process is examined by measuring lifetime and interstitial iron concentration in the wafers after different processing steps and by estimating the cell efficiency potential from injection-dependent bulk lifetime measurements. Interstitial iron concentrations extracted from 2 -D simulations of iron precipitation at crystal defects and gettering during processing agree well with Fei measurements at different process stages and explain the observations. Efficiency losses are quantified to losses due to segregated impurities diffused into the silicon <b>melt,</b> <b>losses</b> due to decorated crystal defects and losses due to solid-state diffusion into the crystal.

40|$|Large garnet poikiloblasts {{hosted by}} leucosome in metapelitic gneiss from Broken Hill reflect complex mineral–melt {{relationship}}s. The spatial {{relationship between the}} leucosomes and the garnet poikiloblasts implies that the growth of garnet was strongly linked {{to the production of}} melt. The apparent difficulty of garnet to nucleate a large number of grains during the prograde breakdown of coexisting biotite and sillimanite led to the spatial focussing of melting reactions around the few garnet nuclei that formed. Continued reaction of biotite and sillimanite required diffusion of elements from where minerals were reacting to sites of garnet growth. This diffusion was driven by chemical potential gradients between garnet-bearing and garnet-absent parts of the rock. As a consequence, melt and peritectic K-feldspar also preferentially formed around the garnet. The diffusion of elements led to the chemical partitioning of the rock within an overall context in which equilibrium may have been approached. Thus, the garnet-bearing leucosomes record in situ melt formation around garnet porphyroblasts rather than centimetre-scale physical melt migration and segregation. The near complete preservation of the high-grade assemblages in the mesosome and leucosome is consistent with substantial <b>melt</b> <b>loss.</b> Interconnected networks between garnet-rich leucosomes provide the most likely pathway for melt migration. Decimetre-scale, coarse-grained, garnet-poor leucosomes may represent areas of melt flux through a large-scale melt transfer network...|$|R

Consideration of water vapour potentials at the boundaries of oxide films predicts that. in air-of normal humidity, a slightly hydrated transitional alumina (n - A 1203) is stable at the oxide/atmosphere interface, and the dehydrated a- A 1203 is stable at the metal/oxide interface. Structures observed in oxide films lifted from, the-liquid metal are consistent with this concept. The morphology of alpha-A 1203 growing at the metal/oxide interface depends on the impurities incorporated within the oxide, and according to circumstances it can appear as degenerate dendritic shapes or plate like structures. The oxidation kinetics, in moist-oxygen, are characterised by a rapid initial rate during which n- A 1203 plays a dominant but diminishing role, followed by much-slower kinetics after the alpha- Al 2 O 3 subfilm is fully established and exercises rate control.

The three-year {{project was}} initially funded {{for the first}} year and was then canceled due to funding cuts at the DOE headquarters. The limited funds allowed the research team to visit industrial sites and investigate the status of using immersion heaters for aluminum melting applications.

40|$|This project {{led to an}} {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms of dross formation. The microstructural evolution in industrial dross samples was determined. Results suggested that dross that forms in layers with structure and composition determined by the local magnesium concentration alone. This finding is supported by fundamental studies of molten metal surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that only magnesium segregates to the molten aluminum alloy surface and reacts to form a growing oxide layer. X-ray diffraction techniques that were using to investigate an oxidizing molten aluminum alloy surface confirmed {{for the first time}} that magnesium oxide is the initial crystalline phase that forms during metal oxidation. The analytical techniques developed in this project are now available to investigate other molten metal surfaces. Based on the improved understanding of dross initiation, formation and growth, technology was developed to minimize <b>melt</b> <b>loss.</b> The concept is based on covering the molten metal surface with a reusable physical barrier. Tests in a laboratory-scale reverberatory furnace confirmed the results of bench-scale tests. The main highlights of the work done include: A clear understanding of the kinetics of dross formation and the effect of different alloying elements on dross formation was obtained. It was determined that the dross evolves in similar ways regardless of the aluminum alloy being melted and the results showed that amorphous aluminum nitride forms first, followed by amorphous magnesium oxide and crystalline magnesium oxide in all alloys that contain magnesium. Evaluation of the molten aluminum alloy surface during melting and holding indicated that magnesium oxide is the first crystalline phase to form during oxidation of a clean aluminum alloy surface. Based on dross evaluation and melt tests it became clear that the major contributing factor to aluminum alloy dross was in the alloys with Mg content. Mg was identified as the primary factor that accelerates dross formation specifically in the transition from two phases to three phase growth. Limiting magnesium oxidation on the surface of molten aluminum therefore becomes the key to minimizing <b>melt</b> <b>loss,</b> and technology was developed to prevent magnesium oxidation on the aluminum surface. This resulted in a lot of the work being focused on the control of Mg oxidation. Two potential molten metal covering agents that could inhibit dross formation during melting and holding consisting of boric acid and boron nitride were identified. The latter was discounted by industry as it resulted in Boron pick up by the melt beyond that allowed by specifications during plant trials. The understanding of the kinetics of dross formation by the industry partners helped them understand how temperature, alloy chemistry and furnace atmosphere (burner controls [...] e. g. excess air) effected dross formation. This enables them to introduce in their plant process changes that reduced unnecessary holding at high temperatures, control burner configurations, reduce door openings to avoid ingress of air and optimize charge mixes to ensure rapid melting and avoid excess oxidation...|$|R
