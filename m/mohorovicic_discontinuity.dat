500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} aspects of Newfoundland geology {{is a result of}} the constant movement of tectonic plates. Approximately 500million years ago the action of these plates forced parts of the oceanic crust beneath the Iapetus Ocean up and over the eastern margin of the North American plate. [...] Sections of oceanic crust which overlie continental crust are known as ophiolites. Gros Morne National Park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because it is one of the best places in the world to see the effects of plate tectonics and one of the few places where rocks formed at the <b>Mohorovicic</b> <b>Discontinuity</b> between the crust and the upper mantle of the Earth can be seen.|$|E
500|$|Earth's interior, {{like that}} of the other {{terrestrial}} planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the <b>Mohorovičić</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> The thickness of the crust varies from about [...] (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and [...] below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year. The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Munk and Harry Hess {{suggested}} {{the idea behind}} Project Mohole: [...] to drill into the <b>Mohorovicic</b> <b>Discontinuity</b> and obtain {{a sample of the}} Earth's mantle. [...] While such a project was not feasible on land, drilling in the open ocean would be more feasible, because the mantle is much closer to the sea floor. [...] Initially led by the informal group of scientists known as the American Miscellaneous Society (AMSOC, including Hess, Maurice Ewing, and Roger Revelle), the project was eventually taken over by the National Science Foundation (NSF). [...] Initial test drillings into the sea floor led by Willard Bascom occurred off Guadalupe Island, Mexico in March and April 1961. [...] The project became mismanaged and increasingly expensive after Brown and Root won the contract to continue the effort, however, and Congress discontinued the project toward the end of 1966. [...] While Project Mohole was not successful, the idea led to projects such as NSF's Deep Sea Drilling Program.|$|E

This has led to some novel applications such as using artificially-induced shocks for exploration of the Earth's subsurface and seismic stimulation for increasing the productivity of oil wells. This book demonstrates the latest techniques and advances in seismic wave analysis from theoretical approach, data acquisition and interpretation, to analyses and numerical simulations, as well as research applications.

Receiver function analysis of seismic body wave data {{can be used to}} discern the geological structure under a seismic receiving station [e. g., Langston, 1979; Owens et al., 1984; Ammon et al., 1990, 1991, Reading and Kennett, 2003]. Receiver function analysis of passive (i. e., from earthquakes) teleseismic data is an important method used to estimate the thickness of Earth’s crust in the vicinity of individual seismic stations [Langston and Hammer, 2001]. Teleseismic data is seismic data that is recorded at epicentral distances equal to or greater than 3, 335 km (Δ ≥ 30 o) and is especially useful in providing such estimates. Estimates of the distance from the Earth’s surface to the <b>Mohorovičić</b> seismic <b>discontinuity</b> (Moho) are good approximations of the thickness of the Earth’s crust. The Moho is the compositional and rheological boundary between the Earth’s lower crust and upper mantle.

40|$|Melting of subducted {{sediment}} remains controversial, {{as direct}} observation of sediment melt generation at mantle depths is not possible. Geochemical fingerprints provide indirect evidence for subduction delivery of sediment to the mantle; however, sediment abundance in mantle-derived melt is generally low (0 %– 2 %), {{and difficult to}} detect. Here we provide evidence for melting of subducted sediment in granite sampled from an exhumed mantle section. Peraluminous granite dikes that intrude peridotite in the Oman–United Arab Emirates ophiolite have U-Pb ages of 99. 8 ± 3. 3 Ma that predate obduction. The dikes have unusually high oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) values for whole rock (14 – 23 ‰) and quartz (20 – 22 ‰), and yield the highest δ 18 O zircon values known (14 – 28 ‰; values relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]). The extremely high oxygen isotope ratios uniquely identify the melt source as high-δ 18 O marine sediment (pelitic and/or siliciceous mud), as no other source could produce granite with such anomalously high δ 18 O. Formation of high-δ 18 O sediment-derived (S-type) granite within peridotite requires subduction of sediment to the mantle, where it melted and intruded overlying mantle wedge.

2500|$|Layer silicates, such as {{the clay}} {{minerals}} and the micas, are very common, and are often formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is kaolinite {{in many of these}} minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral SiIV may be replaced by AlIII, octahedral AlIII by MgII, and OH− by F−. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO2 structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the SiIV atoms with AlIII they require more cations {{to be included in the}} structure to balance charge. Examples include feldspars (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), zeolites, and ultramarines. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi3O8–KAlSi3O8–CaAl2Si2O8. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting AlIII to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the <b>Mohorovičić</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks (truncated cuboctahedra being most common, but other polyhedra are also known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl−, , and , but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.|$|E

Here we provide evidence for bulk melting of subducted sediment in the mantle through isotopic analysis of granite sampled from an exhumed mantle section. Peraluminous granite dikes that intrude peridotite in the Oman-United Arab Emirates ophiolite have U-Pb ages of 99. 8 ± 3. 3 Ma that predate obduction at ca. 85 to 90 Ma.

40|$|New swath bathymetric, {{multichannel}} seismic {{and magnetic}} data reveal {{the complexity of}} the intersection between the extinct West Scotia Ridge (WSR) and the Shackleton Fracture Zone (SFZ), a first-order NW-SE trending high-relief ridge cutting across the Drake Passage. The SFZ is composed of shallow, ridge segments and depressions, largely parallel to the fracture zone with an `en echelon' pattern in plan view. These features are bounded by tectonic lineaments, interpreted as faults. The axial valley of the spreading center intersects the fracture zone in a complex area of deformation, where N 120 ° E lineaments and E–W faults anastomose {{on both sides of the}} intersection. The fracture zone developed within an extensional regime, which facilitated the formation of oceanic transverse ridges parallel to the fracture zone and depressions attributed to pull-apart basins, bounded by normal and strike-slip faults. On the multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles, the igneous crust is well stratified, with numerous discontinuous high-amplitude reflectors and many irregular diffractions at the top, and a thicker layer below. The latter has sparse and weak reflectors, although it locally contains strong, dipping reflections. A bright, slightly undulating reflector observed below the spreading center axial valley at about 0. 75 s (twt) depth in the igneous crust is interpreted as an indication of the relict axial magma chamber. Deep, high-amplitude subhorizontal and slightly dipping reflections are observed between 1. 8 and 3. 2 s (twt) below sea floor, but are preferentially located at about 2. 8 – 3. 0 s (twt) depth. Where these reflections are more continuous they may represent the <b>Mohorovicic</b> seismic <b>discontinuity.</b> More locally, short (2 – 3 km long), very high-amplitude reflections observed at 3. 6 and 4. 3 s (twt) depth below sea floor are attributed to an interlayered upper mantle transition zone. The MCS profiles also show a pattern of regularly spaced, steep-inclined reflectors, which cut across layers 2 and 3 of the oceanic crust. These reflectors are attributed to deformation under a transpressional regime that developed along the SFZ, shortly after spreading ceased at the WSR. Magnetic anomalies 5 to 5 E may be confidently identified on the flanks of the WSR. Our spreading model assumes slow rates (ca. 10 – 20 mm/yr), with slight asymmetries favoring the southeastern flank between 5 C and 5, and the northwestern flank between 5 and extinction. The spreading rate asymmetry means that accretion was slower during formation of the steeper, shallower, southeastern flank than of the northwestern flank...|$|R

The transition zone is located at depths approximately coincidental with the continental <b>Mohorovicic</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> At the Cascadia subduction zone, the distribution of LFEs form a surface roughly parallel to intercrustal seismic events, but displaced 5-10 kilometers down-dip, providing evidence that LFEs are generated at the plate interface.Low frequency earthquakes are an active area of research and may be important seismic indicators for higher magnitude earthquakes. Since slow slip events and their corresponding LFE signals have been recorded, none of them have been accompanied by a megathrust earthquake, however, SSEs act to increase the stress in the seismogenic zone by forcing the locked interval between the subducting and overriding plate to accommodate for down-dip movement. Some calculations find that the probability of a large earthquake occurring during a slow slip event are 30-100 times greater than background probabilities. Understanding the seismic hazard that LFEs might herald is among the primary reasons for their research.
