40|$|Abstract: The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> is {{a highly}} dynamic and {{intensely}} competitive industry. The use of ultrasonic is an analytical technique for providing information about the physicochemical properties of foods is becoming increasingly popular in the food industry. Solvent extraction of oils is a common operation in the processing of seeds to obtain edible oils. The molecular interaction studies on oils and oil mixtures with organic solvents are becoming important in recent years because their properties are needed in food technology and oil industries. The present study focuses {{on the nature of}} intermolecular interactions existing between soybean oil and organic solvents using ultrasound. This paper presents data of ultrasonic velocities and densities of mixtures enclosing soybean oil and different solvents such as ethanol, 2 -propanol, n-hexane and n-butyl acetate that have been measured over the entire range of composition at different temperatures i. e. 303 K to 318 K in the interval of 5 K.

The {{development of the}} company can be likened to natural organisms, businesses over time, undergo changes similar to all living organisms.

Analyzed enterprises were engaged in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> employed at least one worker and were doing business continuously from 2008 to 2013. The ultimate goal was to classify individual businesses into specific phases of development: formation, growth, stabilization, maturation, decline and extinction. Breakdown into various life stages was based on three methods. The first method examined developments in terms of sales for each company and compared it with the industry average. The second procedure was stricter, setting out the order of enterprises {{through the development of}} the three criteria. Third method chose only examples of companies which results of selected financial indicators best characterize a particular stage of development.

40|$|Lipases {{have been}} widely applied in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> and {{in some areas of}} the industry, {{nowadays}} they are used in synthetic organic chemistry catalyzing the hydrolytic/esterification reactions under very mild conditions in the field of protecting groups or enantiomer resolution. In this study, the commercial lipase from bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens was immobilized using the sol-gel process into organosilicate materials with propyl, octyl or phenyl substituents. The highest hydrolytic activity was found in the enzyme on the octyl-derived carrier. The immobilized enzymes differ in their hydrolytic activities on 4 -nitrophenyl esters of various lengths. Subsequent experiments revealed quite good pH stability of the enzymes in a buffer (incubations in pH 3 through pH 11), as well as good temperature stability in isooctane (incubations at up to 100 řC). The majority of organic solvents seem to have no substantial effect on the lipase activity. The biocatalytic properties were studied on a model compound from the group of the acyclic nucleoside analogues - 9 -(2 ', 3 '-dihydroxypropyl) adenine (DHPA). It was found for example that the best acyl donors are vinyl esters, that the lipase shows a preference towards longer vinyl esters, that the reaction proceeds faster in non-polar solvents or that it [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus thermophilus is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the group of lactic acid bacteria, among which several genera play an essential role in <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Recently, a genomic consortium sequenced and annotated its entire genome, which has been demonstrated to contain 1900 coding sequences. In this study, we have revealed the expression products of almost 200 different genes using a proteomic strategy combining 2 -DE plus MALDI-TOF PMF and differential 1 -DE plus muLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Thus, a number of cellular pathways related to important physiological processes were described at the proteomic level. Almost 50 genes were related to multiple electrophoretic species, whose heterogeneity was mainly due to variability in pI values. A 2 -DE reference map obtained for lactose-grown cells was compared with those obtained after heat, cold, acid, oxidative and starvation stresses. Protein up/down-regulation measurements demonstrated that adaptation to different environmental challenges may involve the contribution of unique as well as combined physiological mechanisms. Common regulatory sites in the promoter region of genes whose expression was induced after stress were identified. These results provide a better comprehension of biochemical processes related to stress resistance in S. thermophilus, allowing defining the molecular bases of adaptative responses or markers for the identification of strains with potential industrial applications...|$|E
