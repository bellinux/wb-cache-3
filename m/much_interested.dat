5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting. At {{the same time he}} was also very <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in music and sports and discovered his love for flying at the Gaisberg near Salzburg. Here he attended the glider flying school of the Austrian Aëro Club. He attended a basic flying course with the second air regiment in Graz and Wiener Neustadt even before he joined the military service.|$|E
5|$|Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made {{preparations}} {{to return}} to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing his current novel, The Mating Season, in {{the peace of the}} French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, {{and for the first time}} in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.|$|E
25|$|He became <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in a Federation of New England Natural History Societies, {{and this}} he {{considered}} {{as the most}} useful way of stimulating interest in Natural History. He was the Secretary and principal support of this society until his death.|$|E

25|$|He {{had also}} little trust in Lord Gort, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, whom Brooke thought too <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in details and {{incapable}} {{of taking a}} broad strategic view. Gort, on the other hand, regarded Brooke as a pessimist who failed to spread confidence, and was thinking of replacing him.|$|E

25|$|The area to {{the west}} of {{northern}} Lake Malawi was occupied by two indigenous peoples, the Tumbuka and Ngonde, and the recently-arrived Ngoni. Although the Tumbuka were already involved in the East African ivory trade, in the 1820s and 1830s Swahili traders from the Indian Ocean coast and backed by Indian financiers in Zanzibar, as <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in slaves as ivory, entered the area and displaced the earlier merchants. Finally, in the late 1870s, the African Lakes Company began trading in ivory along the shores of Lake Malawi, establishing trading posts in the early 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. She was <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, and she could tell a story. She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was not <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in architecture. Aurangzeb {{constructed}} a small marble mosque {{known as the}} Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Red Fort complex in Delhi. He ordered {{the construction of the}} Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. He also {{constructed a}} mosque on Benares. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in Kashmir. The structure of Bibi Ka Maqbara in Aurangabad, which now is a historical monument was constructed by the sons of Aurangzeb in remembrance of their mother. The inspiration came from Taj mahal as is quite visible from its architecture.|$|E

25|$|In {{parallel}} to his military service at Gießen, Joppien was very <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> {{and involved in}} glider construction and glider flight. His transfer to the Luftwaffe was somewhat delayed as Joppien had been tasked with the training of new officer recruits. On 15 October 1935, his transfer to the Luftwaffe was finally authorized. Until Christmas 1935, he had logged 100 solo flights and in June 1936 he became a flight instructor. He was promoted to Unterfeldwebel (junior non-commissioned officer) on 1 October 1936, to Feldwebel (non-commissioned officer) on 1 February 1937, and to Oberfeldwebel (staff sergeant) on 1 July 1937.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to small base-metal coins, the Ming issued fiat paper currency {{as the standard}} currency {{from the beginning of}} the reign until 1450, by which point – like its predecessors – it was suffering from hyperinflation and rampant counterfeiting. (In 1425, Ming notes were trading at about 0.014% of its original value under the Hongwu Emperor.) Monetary needs were initially met by bullion trading in silver sycee, but a shortage of silver in the mid-15th century caused a severe monetary contraction and forced a great deal of trade to be conducted by barter. China had not been <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in European or Japanese goods but the silver of Iwami Ginzan and Potosí was too profitable and important to restrict. Inflows of Japanese and Spanish silver monetized China's economy, and Spanish dollars became a common medium of exchange.|$|E

25|$|But {{in spite}} of the {{pressure}} of debt and poverty, which was not diminished during his term of office, the prior was as <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> as his predecessors had been in the course of public events. Like most of the clergy and religious of the period, he was in sympathy with Simon de Montfort, whom he looked upon as the champion of the Church; and in 1263, when the earl visited Dunstable, the prior went out to meet him, and admitted him to the fraternity of the house. In 1265 a council was held at Dunstable to consider the possibility of peace with the defeated barons, and the king and queen visited the house {{in the course of the}} year; but though Simon de Montfort had been there quite recently, and the sympathy of the prior with his cause could not have been altogether a secret one, no fine was imposed upon the priory on that account.|$|E
25|$|A fourth attempt {{came from}} the state of Virginia. Former President John Tyler, a private citizen of Virginia who was still <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in the fate of the nation, had been {{appointed}} as a special Virginia envoy to President James Buchanan to urge him {{to maintain the status quo}} in regard to the seceded states. Later, Tyler was an elected delegate to the Virginia convention called to consider whether or not to follow the Deep South states out of the Union. Tyler thought that a final collective effort should be made to preserve the Union and in a document published on January 17, 1861, he called for a convention of the six free and six slave border states to resolve the sectional split. Governor John Letcher of Virginia had already made a similar request to the state legislature, agreed to sponsor the convention while the list of attendees to all of the states was expanded. Corwin agreed to hold off any final vote on his House plan pending the final actions of the Peace Conference.|$|E

500|$|The {{contests}} were refereed {{by officials}} called sticklers, {{from which the}} phrase [...] "a stickler for the rules" [...] is derived. Sticklers were so-named because they carried sticks, with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen. No scores or times are recorded {{for any of the}} events. Portable watches of the time were [...] "rare, costly, and relatively unreliable devices", but perhaps just as importantly [...] "nobody in Dover's time was <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in sports record-keeping or record-breaking".|$|E

[...] Finally, Johannes succeeds in having Cordelia break the engagement herself. [...] He will use irony, artifice, caprice, imagination and arbitrariness to engineer poetically satisfying possibilities; he is not so <b>much</b> <b>interested</b> in the act of seduction as in willfully creating its interesting possibility.|$|E
