40|$|A classiﬁcation {{system of}} catastrophic events is a {{methodology}} assembling all the catastrophe groups. There are many classiﬁcations of catastrophes. The most widely known are classiﬁed into: nature, {{consequences of the}} event, duration, aﬀected territories and areas of the destroyed zone, and at last into the needed intervention measures. It is diﬃcult to study the complexity of catastrophes with these classiﬁcations. We propose {{a new system of}} classiﬁcations of catastrophes based on “Complexity Criteria”. Within the scope of this paper, we focus ﬁrst on organization, self-organization and emergence of the event, and then on spatial and temporal scales of the catastrophes. The organization is a key concept of complexity. In the catastrophe ﬁeld, complexity of organization results essentially from the self-organization of the systems (the system develops its internal constitution and its behaviour because of the interactions between its various components and not because of an external strength). Phenomena as diﬀerent as <b>mantels</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> seismic hazards, behaviours of the persons and the crowd have characteristics of selforganization allowing the emergence <b>of</b> new events: <b>snow</b> avalanches, earthquakes, collective panic. A particular attention will be given to the emer- gence of collective panic in a context of catastrophe. We observe that emergent properties appear after the interactions between the individuals and the crowd happened It means that we need {{to take into account the}} multi-scales aspect in order to be able to study the behaviours.

It {{is possible to}} identify several catastrophes classifications. The most widely known are classified into: nature, consequences of the event, duration, affected territories and areas of the destroyed zone, and at last into the needed intervention measures. But these criteria of classification allow with difficulty to apprehend {{the complexity of the}} catastrophe. Thus we propose a classification based on the complex characteristics of the risks and catastrophes. Within the scope of this paper, we focus first on the complexity of the organization and the emergence of the phenomenon which result from it, and then, on the complexities resulting to the spatial and temporal scales of the catastrophe. The organization is considered as a central concept of the complexity. In the field of the catastrophe, the complexity of organization results essentially from the self-organization of the systems (the system develops its internal constitution and its behaviour thanks to the interactions between its various components and not thanks to an external strength). Phenomena as different as <b>mantels</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> seismic hazards, behaviours of people and population have characteristics of self-organization allowing the emergence of new events: snowslides, earthquakes, collective panic. A particular attention will be given to the emergence of this kind of panic in situation of disaster. There is indeed a double-way within two levels, a double action of the crowd on the individual and the individual on the crowd, without leader. It means that we need {{to take into account the}} multi-scales aspect in order to be able to study the behaviours. The complex systems of catastrophe have characteristics able to emerge at higher or lower levels of scales. It allows us to apprehend the complexity of the disasters through the scales. The disasters belong to the multifarious temporal- and space scales. First, the disasters can not be classified in one single category of spatial scale. Some of them appear on the scale of a territory, a region, a country or the planet. If we speak about a natural or technological disaster, none of them will be automatically associated with a spatial scale. Furthermore, a local disaster can have large-scale impacts. Various events (attacks of September 11 th, 2001 in New-York, the tsunami which ravaged the South of Asia in December 2004, the hurricane Katrina who destroys New-Orleans in 2005) remind us that the catastrophe is not always an event restricted at the affected area but can have consequences outside this area. The increase of the complexity of the disaster can result from the movement between different spatial levels and from systemic relations between these levels. The complexity also results from various temporal scales of the risks and the disasters. Three temporal phases can be found. The first one is relative to the temporality of the potential risk I mean what takes place before the disaster. The second phase refers to the temporality of the disaster I mean all what happens during the catastrophe. We show that during the disaster, the temporalities of the hazard, the vulnerability and the domino effects rarely happen together. The third and last phase refers to the time after the disaster and to the experience feedback for the risk management. These three temporal phases are based on two scales of time: a short time, I mean a time - action, inherent to the functioning of any dynamic system (Ch. -P. P´eguy, 2001) and a long time. Thus, the catastrophe must be approached in various scales. And the study in each of the scales gives several information of the disaster in its whole, or about some of its components (hazard, vulnerability and domino effects) ...|$|R

40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other substances, snow {{responds}} visco-elastically to a force applied to it provided that the force remains so small that it does not break down the snow. M. de Quervain studied the visco-elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and ice by twisting a pillar <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> or ice and found that their mechanical properties could be qualitatively represented by a rheological model composed of a Maxwell unit and a Voigt unit in series connection (1). Exten-sive investigations on the viscous properties <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> namely the creep phenome-non <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> were performed by R. Haefeli as early as 1939 (2), and recently Edwin Bucher, from the rheological point of view, made studies on creep <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> by applying to it torsional, tensile and compressive force (3).
