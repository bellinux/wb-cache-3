Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers.

40|$|New {{environmental}} regulations {{all over the}} world encourage the use of alternatives to cadmium plating for corrosion-protection systems used on steels. Boeing patents are pending on a non-cyanide replacement zinc nickel alloy electroplating process with superior properties, including low hydrogen embrittlement and good corrosion protection, for use on highstrength steels and other substrates. Another advantage of this process is low cost because conventional electroplating tank facilities can be used and waste treatment cost can be reduced. The feasibility of this zinc-nickel plating process has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and is scheduled for manufacturing scale-up during 1983. ALTHOUGH THE CADMIUM AND CYANIDE HAZARDS to human health are well known and documented W*, cyanide cadmium electroplating is widely used on steel for its many beneficial properties (2, 3, 4). In the United States alone, the annual cadmium consumption for plating is approximately five million pounds (5). Increasingly stringent {{environmental regulations}} {{all over the world}} encourage the use of alternatives to cadmium plating for corrosion-protection systems used on steel. For aircraft highstrength steel parts, a substitute for cadmium plating must ensure long-term corrosion protection and provide low hydrogen embrittlement (LHE) (6, 7, 8, 9). <b>Mechanical</b> <b>plating,</b> ion vapor deposition (IVD) of aluminum, aqueous coating dispersion, and bonded solid-film lubricants are mentioned (10, 111 as possible alternative candidates to cadmium plating.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report some {{experimental}} archaeology research consisting in applying a two-step electrochemical displacement {{procedure in order}} to simulate the fabrication route {{which could have been}} used by coin counterfeiters of the 3 rd century BC for the silvering of a Pb substrate. A material characterisation of a relevant archaeological item [5] has revealed a bi-layer coating, with a Cu interlayer and an Ag top layer. SEM morphology and XRD textures of the Cu and Ag layers cannot be explained with thermal or mechanical procedures and exhibit typical features of electrochemical displacement processes. We replicated a coating process with materials that are documented for the historical period of interest and that lead to the formation of a bi-layer coating exhibiting essentially the same morphological and structural properties of the archaeological object. The direct displacement coating of Pb with Ag has been shown not to be feasible with period chemicals, whilst the duplex coating could be achieved by sequential use of a Cu(II) -acetate solution, displacing Pb, and of a Ag(I) solution obtained by dissolving AgCl in dilute ammonia. The coatings obtained have been characterised by SEM; XRD and colorimetry. The double displacement process yields a cauliflower-like agglomerate structure, showing close similarities with the morphology of residual white-metal coating of the coin. Cu and Ag displacement layers exhibit a typical (111) texture that cannot be reconciled with that obtained by thermal or <b>mechanical</b> <b>plating</b> techniques and that matches the texture found in the counterfeit coin.
