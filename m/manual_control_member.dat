40|$|Abstract—It {{is known}} that {{limitations}} of human accuracy in manual manipulation hinder the quality of work performed by human operators of <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> systems. Indeed, movements of operators are apt to cause undesirable vibrations in <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> systems. In this paper, we propose a new operator-support control scheme for suppressing harmful oscillatory motions in such systems without disturbing human operator’s manipulation. The proposed scheme {{is based on the}} fact that steady-state blocking zeros of a feedback controller do not affect the steady-state control input. A finite-dimensional feedback controller with steady-state blocking zeros, called a washout controller in this paper, plays the central role in support for operator’s manipulation. However, the dynamics of a <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> system may become different significantly from its initial model used for the design of an initial washout controller when it is applied to the <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> system. Such difference can result in poor performance of operator-sup-port control. In order to improve it, an iterative procedure is presented for redesign of washout controllers based on closed-loop subspace identification. Closed-loop identification is performed to refine the model for the control design, and then a more sophisti-cated washout controller is obtained using the identified model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by an experiment on <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of an inverted pendulum.

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{adaptive}} {{changes in how}} inertial cues from the vestibular system are integrated with other sensory information leads to perceptual disturbances and impaired <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> following transitions between gravity environments. The primary goals of this ongoing post-flight investigation are to quantify decrements in <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of tilt motion following short-duration spaceflight and to evaluate vibrotactile feedback of tilt as a sensorimotor countermeasure. METHODS. Data is currently being collected on 9 astronaut subjects during 3 preflight sessions and during the first 8 days after Shuttle landings. Variable radius centrifugation (216 deg/s, 30 % based on the gain or the amount of tilt disturbance successfully nulled. <b>Manual</b> <b>control</b> performance tended to return to baseline levels within 1 - 2 days following landing. Root-mean-square position error and tilt velocity were significantly reduced with vibrotactile feedback. CONCLUSIONS. These preliminary {{results are consistent with}} our hypothesis that adaptive changes in vestibular processing corresponds to reduced <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> performance following G-transitions. A simple vibrotactile prosthesis improves the ability to null out tilt motion within a limited range of motion disturbances...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to describe the ability of human operators to interact with adaptive automation (AA) applied to various stages of complex systems information processing, defined in a model of human-automation interaction. Forty participants operated a simulation of an air traffic control task. Automated assistance was adaptively applied to information acquisition, information analysis, decision making, and action implementation aspects of the task based on operator workload states, which were measured using a secondary task. The differential effects of the forms of automation were determined and compared with a <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> condition. Results of two 20 -min trials of AA or <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> revealed a significant effect of the type of automation on performance, particularly during <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> periods as part of the adaptive conditions. Humans appear to better adapt to AA applied to sensory and psychomotor information-processing functions (action implementation) than to AA applied to cognitive functions (information analysis and decision making), and AA is superior to completely <b>manual</b> <b>control.</b> Potential applications of {{this research}} include the design of automation to support air traffic controller information processing...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} concerned with experimental studies of the effects of translational whole-body vibration on continuous <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> performance is presented.

Studies of the effects of vibration duration on <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> performance are reviewed separately. A behavioural model is presented to summarize the mechanisms (including vibration breakthrough, visual impairment, neuro-muscular interference and central effects) by which whole-body vibration may interfere with the performance of continuous <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> tasks.
