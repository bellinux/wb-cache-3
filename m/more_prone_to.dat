5|$|Women and {{men have}} {{different}} {{experiences of the}} same illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression and dementia, and are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> urinary tract infections than men.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} mostly subarctic, more {{continental}} in the hinterland and <b>more</b> maritime and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> monsoons on the coast.|$|R
50|$|Oxidation is {{a change}} in the {{chemical}} composition of the material due to environmental factors. The oxidized material is <b>more</b> brittle and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> crack creation.|$|R
50|$|Armoured buses weigh {{considerably}} more than ordinary buses. As a result, they use <b>more</b> fuel, are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> mechanical breakdowns, have very high maintenance costs and wear out faster.|$|R
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, {{that makes them}} <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Human-raised R. norvegicus are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> {{specific}} {{health risks}} and diseases than their wild counterparts, {{but they are}} also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet.|$|E
5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> hydrolysis.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{integrity}} {{for expansion}} and flexion of hoof, making it <b>more</b> brittle and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> sand & quarter cracks. Narrow white line {{makes it hard}} to hold shoes on.|$|R
50|$|The {{aetiology}} of thoracic endometriosis is unknown. Patients {{with multiple}} previous operations are <b>more</b> <b>prone,</b> due <b>to</b> the manipulation that may cause embolisation of the endometrial tissue into the thoracic cavity. Some thoracic endometriosis patients {{have been described}} as having a congenital defect in the diaphragm. There is also an association between thoracic and pelvic endometriosis.|$|R
5000|$|Zone valves are {{inherently}} <b>more</b> unreliable and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> {{a very high}} failure rate. Zone valves operated by electric timing motors aren't [...] "fail safe" [...] (failing to the [...] "open" [...] condition).|$|R
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to {{reduce the likelihood of}} breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found that American audiences were less attentive and <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quality of}} a {{relationship}} between offended and offending partners can affect whether forgiveness is both sought and given. [...] In essence, the more invested one is in a relationship, the <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> they are <b>to</b> minimize the hurt associated with transgressions and seek reconciliation.|$|R
50|$|One {{complication}} {{to watch}} out for later on in the cat's life with a tendonectomy is the nails getting brittle. Nails that are <b>more</b> brittle are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> splitting and shattering when trimmed by the owner, which is quite painful for the cat.|$|R
2500|$|A metapopulation {{generally}} {{consists of}} several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied. [...] Each population cycles in relative {{independence of the}} other populations and eventually goes extinct {{as a consequence of}} demographic stochasticity (fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events); the smaller the population, the <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> it is <b>to</b> extinction.|$|R
5|$|Women are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> UTIs {{than men}} because, in females, the urethra is much shorter {{and closer to}} the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons why}} women are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> than men <b>to</b> develop a {{syndrome}} X condition {{are still not}} clear. However, {{it is believed that}} hormones along with other risk factors unique to women play a very important role. The constant changing of the estrogen levels {{may be one of the}} reasons along with the changes brought by birth.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, as {{computing}} power grew, more advanced (and more difficult) card-counting systems came into favor. Many card counters agree, however, that a simpler and less advantageous {{system that can}} be played flawlessly for hours earns an overall higher return than a <b>more</b> complex system <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> user error.|$|R
25|$|In {{artificial}} selection studies, specific strains of rats were bred to prefer alcohol. These rats preferred drinking alcohol over other liquids, {{resulting in a}} tolerance for alcohol and exhibited a physical dependency on alcohol. Rats that were not bred for this preference did not have these traits. Upon analyzing the brains of these two strains of rats, {{it was discovered that}} there were differences in chemical composition of certain areas of the brain. This study suggests that certain brain mechanisms are <b>more</b> genetically <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> alcoholism.|$|R
5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was found that women who are raising children and are in the workforce are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} two extinct lemur species were {{previously}} classified under the genus Varecia. Found at sites {{in central and}} southwestern Madagascar, Varecia insignis and V. jullyi were very similar to modern ruffed lemurs, but more robust and assumed to be more terrestrial, and thus <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> predation by early human settlers. More {{recent studies have shown}} that these extinct species had a diet similar to that of modern ruffed lemurs, and that they were also arboreal in nature. Enough differences were demonstrated to merit a separate genus, Pachylemur. These close relatives of ruffed lemurs are now named Pachylemur insignis and P. jullyi.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> flooding.|$|E
50|$|Surface piercings can be <b>more</b> or less <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> rejection, {{depending}} on where on the body they are situated. For example, the {{nape of the neck}} is less likely to reject a surface piercing than the sternum.Microdermals and Skin Divers are becoming more popular than surface piercings, as they last much longer and {{are less likely to be}} rejected.|$|R
40|$|Flash {{fire test}} results on 86 materials, {{evaluated}} using the USF flash fire screening test, are presented. The materials which appear least <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> flash fires are PVC, polyphenylene oxide and sulfide, and polyether and polyaryl sulfone; these {{did not produce}} flash fires under these particular test conditions. The principal value of these screening tests {{at the present time}} is in identifying materials which appear <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> flash fires, and in identifying which formulations of a generic material are <b>more</b> or less <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> flash fires...|$|R
50|$|On July 23, 2004, {{news reports}} claimed that a former spouse of a {{prominent}} international track athlete said that the ex-spouse had used insulin {{as a way of}} 'energizing' the body. There is no evidence to suggest it should act as a performance enhancer in non-diabetics. Poorly controlled diabetics are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> than others <b>to</b> exhaustion and tiredness, and properly administered insulin can relieve such symptoms.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
50|$|Some {{women are}} however <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> than others <b>to</b> {{developing}} DCIS. Women considered at higher risks {{are those who}} {{have a family history of}} breast cancer, those who have had their periods at an early age or who have had a late menopause. Also, women who have never had children or had them late in life are also more likely to get this condition.|$|R
5000|$|Process {{variation}} - As photolithography techniques {{get closer}} to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires is becoming <b>more</b> difficult and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> errors due to variation. Designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication process corners before a chip is certified ready for production, or use system-level techniques for dealing with effects of variation.|$|R
40|$|NEEDLE ICE EROSION IN THE SERRA DO GERÊS (NW PORTUGAL) - After a short {{review of}} the studies on needle ice in the world, its {{morphogenetic}} significance in the Serra do Gerês is discussed. Several needle ice induced morphological features were identified in the field. Nevertheless, cryogenic features are in most cases ephemeral, being destroyed {{by the action of}} processes with higher morphogenetic capacity (i. e. runoff). Needle ice acts mostly as a disruptive agent, causing the desagregation of weathered granite or other non-choesive deposits. The resultant material is easily transported by other processes, like runoff or wind. The <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> areas <b>to</b> needle ice formation are also discussed...|$|R
