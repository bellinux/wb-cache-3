2500|$|Hymes {{formulated}} {{a response}} to Noam Chomsky's influential distinction between competence (knowledge of grammatical rules necessary to decoding and producing language) and performance (actual language use in context). Hymes objected to the marginalization of performance {{from the center of}} linguistic inquiry and proposed the notion of communicative competence, or knowledge necessary to use language in social context, as an object of linguistic inquiry. Since appropriate language use is conventionally defined, and varies across different communities, much of Hymes early work frames a project for ethnographic investigation into contrasting patterns of language use across speech communities. Hymes termed this approach [...] "the ethnography of speaking." [...] The SPEAKING acronym, described below, was presented as a lighthearted heuristic to aid fieldworkers in their attempt to document and analyze instances of language in use, which he termed [...] "speech events." [...] Embedded in the acronym is an application and extension of Jakobson's arguments concerning the <b>multifunctionality</b> of language. He articulated other, more technical, often typologically oriented approaches to variation in patterns of language use across speech communities in a series of articles.|$|E

40|$|ABO 3 perovskites have fascinated {{solid-state}} chemists and physicists {{for decades}} because they display a seemingly inexhaustible variety {{of chemical and}} physical properties. However, despite the diversity of properties found among perovskites, very few of these materials are ferroelectric, or even polar, in bulk. In this Perspective, we highlight recent theoretical and experimental studies that have shown how a combination of non-polar structural distortions, commonly tilts or rotations of the BO 6 octahedra, can give rise to polar structures or ferroelectricity in several families of layered perovskites. We discuss the crystal chemical origin of the polarization {{in each of these}} families – which emerges through a so-called ‘trilinear coupling’ or ‘hybrid improper’ mechanism – and emphasize areas in which further theoretical and experimental investigation is needed.

40|$|Biomacromolecules usually form complex {{superstructures}} {{in natural}} biotissues, such as different alignments of collagen fibres in articular cartilages, for <b>multifunctionalities.</b> Inspired by nature, there are efforts towards developing multiscale ordered structures in hydrogels (recognized {{as one of}} the best candidates of soft biotissues). However, creating complex superstructures in gels are hardly realized because of the absence of effective approaches to control the localized molecular orientation. Here we introduce a method to create various superstructures of rigid polyanions in polycationic hydrogels. The control of localized orientation of rigid molecules, which are sensitive to the internal stress field of the gel, is achieved by tuning the swelling mismatch between masked and unmasked regions of the photolithographic patterned gel. Furthermore, we develop a double network structure to toughen the hydrogels with programmed superstructures, which deform reversibly under large strain.

40|$|A {{possible}} Ge-on-insulator (GOI) structure, namely, stripe arrays with nanospacing, {{was proposed}} as a promising epitaxial template {{structure for the}} Ge epitaxial layer. Agglomeration-free single-crystalline GOI stripe arrays with thickness of 50 nm and spacing down to 0. 5 μm were successfully grown by the Si-seeded rapid-melting growth technique. The growth of GOI stripe arrays with a spacing of 0. 1 μm was not achieved owing due to the severe agglomeration of Ge during the heat treatment. This {{may be due to}} the small adhesion area of the capping layer between the stripes where it could not withstand the force caused by Ge agglomeration. From the electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) measurement, the rotational growth was confirmed by the observation of various orientations when the thickness of the Ge layer was reduced to 20 nm.
