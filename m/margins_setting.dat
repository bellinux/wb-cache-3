The provenance of middle to late Miocene clastic sediments of Cibao basin in northern Hispaniola has been assessed via integrated methods including detrital framework modes, clay mineral assemblages and ratios, the composition of individual feldspar grains, and the distribution and abundance of trace elements and rare earth elements (REE). Framework modes of middle to late Miocene clastic samples suggest a source mainly from recycled orogen provenance. Individual feldspar compositions determined by electron microprobe analysis indicate derivation from plutonic, metamorphic, and possibly volcanic sources. Trace elements and REE data demonstrate that the middle and late Miocene sediments in the central to eastern Cibao basin display two geochemically distinctive type features. Type 1 sediments, with relatively lower total REE, Th, Sc and Cr+Ni values, correspond to relatively higher chlorite/illite ratio and varied feldspar abundance. Type 2 sediments, with relatively higher total REE, Th, Sc and Cr+Ni values, are consistent with lower chlorite/illite ratio and lower percentage of feldspar. These geochemical characteristics suggest that middle to late Miocene clastic sediments in Cibao basin are related to an active continental <b>margins</b> <b>setting.</b> Multiple sources are suggested by this study.

The framework grains in the sandstones suggest mixing of sediments from spatially separated gneissic, quartzitic and phyllitic source rocks. Modal values of different framework minerals suggest that recycled sediments in an orogenic setting were deposited in the Middle Siwalik basin in the area. The major and trace element ratios suggest dominantly felsic input and mixing with subordinate basic material in an upper continental crustal setup.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present an {{alternative}} method of computing volatility for the purpose of <b>setting</b> <b>margins.</b> The <b>setting</b> of <b>margins</b> is closely related to the volatility of futures price changes. If volatility for the forthcoming week is expected to be high, then <b>margins</b> should be <b>set</b> larger. If volatility is expected to be low, then margins may be smaller. Margins posted by trading members are costly to them, so excessively large margins are not desirable.

Characterized bylarge areas ofchevron-folded turbidite sequences, linked contractional nd strike-slip faults, and superposed thrust-belts of different age and vergence, it has {{large volumes of}} granite and low pressure/high temperature metamorphic rocks. Surface structural elements uggest hat it formed by massive telescoping and strike-slip translation within a continental margin sediment prism along the former margin of Gondwanaland during the mid-Palaeozoic. Migrating, sporadic compressional nd extensional events over the 100 Ma deformational history of the belt produced acrustally thickened, high geothermal gradient orogen, involving non-craton directed thrusting in an inferred convergent <b>margin</b> <b>setting.</b> Compressional periods were marked by eastward-migrating deformation zones involving detachment-related fol ing and reverse faulting in the largely turbidite dominated sequences.

Extension was marked by localized evelopment of rift basins and half grabens accompanied byextensive granitic magmatism andsilicic volcanism. Subsequent basin collapse was by reactivation/inversion of the extensional faults and folding of the basinal sequence.

40|$|Permian (Guadalupian and Lopingian) reefs in Ziyun County, {{southern}} Guizhou, southwestern China, {{occur in}} a carbonate platform <b>margin</b> <b>setting.</b> Guadalupian reefs (Maokouan) are characterized by sponges, calcimicrobes, microbialites (as microencrusters) and syndepositional calcite cement. Global sea level falling in the latest Guadalupian changed the reef biotopes. Lower Lopingian (Wuchiapingian) deposits reflect a rapid transgressive-regressive cycle; reefs were not developed during that time, although coral biostromes are common. However, microbial carbonates occur commonly in these biostromes, including dark-coloured, homogeneous microbialite, free-growing microbes, Shamovella and Archaeolithoporella (interpreted to be problematic microbial deposits). Upper Lopingian (Changhsingian) reefs were formed by sponges, microbialites, Shamovella, Archaeolithoporella, automicrite and syndepositional calcite cement. Common primary encrustations consist of thin, homogeneous, subparallel layers of Archaeolithoporella, which is an important reef builder particularly throughout the Lopingian reef succession. Secondary encrustations are characterized by dark-coloured, homogeneous microbialite containing thin thalli that alternate with light-coloured microspar/pseudospar. Reef-building organisms (e. g., sponges, Archaeolithoporella, calcimicrobes and hydrozoans) were bound, lithified and preserved by syndepositional calcite cement and microbially precipitated micrite (automicrite). In Changhsingian reefs of the Shitouzhai Limestone, microbial carbonate (e. g., micritic peloidal crusts and automicrite layers) encrusted the top, sides and undersides of in situ organisms and also grew on their upper surface as thick accumulations. Radiaxial fibrous calcite cement is present, but is not common. Abundant microbial carbonates in the Guadalupian to Lopingian reefs in Ziyun indicate that microbial precipitation of calcium carbonate played {{a vital role in}} the development of Permian reefs in this platform <b>margin</b> <b>setting.</b> (c) 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether sediments with subtly different provenances could be recognised within a passive <b>margin</b> <b>setting,</b> samples {{were taken from}} Westphalian sedimentary rocks of the Pennine Basin, South Wales Coalfield, Culm Basin of Britain and from Northern Ireland. Although previous work has shown that 3 major source areas {{were responsible for the}} infill of the Pennine Basin, this study is restricted to sediments believed to have been derived from the west. Their nominally similar western provenance was confirmed using Sm–Nd isotope techniques and their deposition in a passive <b>margin</b> <b>setting</b> was established using elemental discrimination diagrams. While the overall sediment provenance may have been from the west, the trace element geochemistry indicates that at least two major sediment pathways can be distinguished. Plots of Eu/Eu*–GdN/YbN, along with ternary plots of Cr/V–Ti/Zr–GdN/YbN or Sc/Cr suggest different source areas for the Culm Basin and the South Wales Coalfield. In the Culm Basin the Cr/V ratio generally exceeds 1. 25, with a small Eu anomaly and a low GdN/YbN ratio. The Cr/V ratio is less than 1. 25 in the South Wales with a larger Eu ratio and a higher GdN/YbN than the Culm Basin. Significant separation of the Culm Basin and the South Wales Coalfield during the early Westphalian by the Bristol Channel–Bray Fault may have been a factor contributing to the provenance differences. Late Carboniferous dextral displacement along this fault brought these basins into close juxtaposition, and {{it is unlikely that the}} ‘Bristol Channel Landmass’ formed a common source area for these two basins. ...|$|R
