The <b>mini</b> SEPP consist of solar cells, boost converter, and ATmega 128 microcontroller. Fuzzy logic as control method is used to control output voltage of <b>mini</b> SEPP. In this research, error tolerance of <b>mini</b> SEPP output voltage is 5 % of set voltage. Testing of <b>mini</b> SEPP has done in three conditions: cloudy weather, sunny with cloud weather, and sunny weather. Result of the test had shown that <b>mini</b> SEPP worked in sunny weather properly but it didn’t work properly in cloudy weather and sunny weather with cloud because output power of solar cells was not at maximum point but the <b>mini</b> SEPP still charged notebook battery...|$|R
