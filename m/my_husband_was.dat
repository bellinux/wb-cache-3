25|$|When <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote {{a part of}} it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the statue}} was very positive. [...] The New York Times {{described it as}} producing [...] "an impression of dignity, beauty, and power." [...] But in the weeks following the dedication ceremony, praise turned to criticism and reporters noted [...] "absurdities" [...] in the relief panels. [...] They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely. [...] The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President Chester A. Arthur was called [...] "impossible" [...] and [...] "ridiculous." [...] Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881. [...] Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877. [...] Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered. [...] In a heated letter to the Evening Star, she said the reliefs were {{not meant to be}} historically accurate: [...] "Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it because we wanted these panels to portray the most prominent men {{of the history of the}} country who were in the Senate during the 16 years that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> Senator." [...] She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been [...] "absurd." ...|$|E

Her husband, Emil Uzunov, in a 2003 interview with Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) {{said that the}} defence lawyer Bizanti {{was one of the}} torturers who beat the six medics during the initial interrogations. Chervenyashka had to correct the story. [...] "I suppose <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> too nervous and over-reacted," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody {{was going to try}} to take me out, I was going to take them with me.|$|E
2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Friedan {{stated in}} her memoir Life So Far (2000) that Carl had beaten her during their marriage; friends such as Dolores Alexander {{recalled}} having {{to cover up}} black eyes from Carl's abuse in time for press conferences (Brownmiller 1999, p.70). But Carl denied abusing her {{in an interview with}} Time magazine shortly after the book was published, describing the claim as a [...] "complete fabrication". She later said, on Good Morning America, [...] "I almost wish I hadn't even written about it, because it's been sensationalized out of context. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> not a wife-beater, and I was no passive victim of a wife-beater. We fought a lot, and he was bigger than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I want to {{just give}} you a {{personal}} anecdote about terrorism, because less than 20 years ago, I {{was the target of}} a terrorist group. It was the New World Liberation Front. They blew up power stations and put a bomb at my home when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> dying of cancer. And the bomb was set to detonate at two o'clock in the morning, but it was a construction explosive that doesn't detonate when it drops below freezing. [...] It doesn't usually freeze in San Francisco, but on this night, it dropped below freezing, and the bomb didn't detonate. I was very lucky. But, I thought of what might have happened. Later the same group shot out all the windows of my home.|$|E
2500|$|Abed Abu Jamal's widow, Nadia, {{was served}} with a {{demolition}} order on her house in East Jerusalem. her residency rights have been revoked, and she will be expelled to her family home in the West Bank. Her 3 children, Walid (6), Salma (4) and Mohammed (3), the last of which suffers from a heart condition, are permitted to stay in East Jerusalem, as their birth-place, but their rights to all social benefits, including medical coverage has been cancelled. She is protesting the measures, which she calls an example of collective punishment. She said that [...] "If we'd known that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> planning an attack, of course we would have stopped him" [...] while her in-laws said [...] {{that they could not}} come to terms with what pushed Ghassan and Uday to attack the place of worship.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
