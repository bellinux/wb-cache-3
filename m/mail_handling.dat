2500|$|The main {{waiting room}} {{on the main floor}} was modeled after an ancient Roman bathhouse, with walls of marble and vaulted ceilings. The {{building}} also housed a large hall adorned with Doric columns that housed the ticket office and arcade shops. Beyond the arcade was the concourse, which had brick walls and a large copper skylight. From here, passengers would walk down a ramp to a tunnel from which the platforms could be accessed by stairs and elevators. [...] Under the shed there were ten passenger platforms consisting of one side platform and five island platforms along ten paired tracks. In addition, one track served the Railway Express Agency (REA) mail service {{at the southern end of}} the shed. Immediately outside the shed were seven additional freight tracks. Below the tracks and building was a large area for baggage and <b>mail</b> <b>handling</b> and offices.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the original contract specifications, Airtrans was originally built to support both freight and passenger service. Inter-terminal baggage was handled by 89 LD3 containers, which were loaded {{on a series of}} semi-automated conveyor belt systems at each terminal. During construction the airport demanded a lower required time for inter-terminal handling, and a different system had to be installed that could meet these increased speeds - the Airtrans baggage handling system was never used in operations. Likewise, the <b>mail</b> <b>handling</b> services were demonstrated at the [...] "Air Mail Facility", but the USPS declined to use it as they felt it was too demanding in that it required their employees to interface with an automatic system. An incinerator was built for trash handling, but never worked properly and was never put into use. Instead, trash from the terminals was moved on the existing passenger vehicles after hours. In the end, only the supplies facility would use the cargo vehicles, operating with great success until 1991 when increased demands for passenger services forced the cargo vehicles to be converted to passenger bodies.|$|E

5000|$|The first Frankfurt {{train station}} was a built is a {{terminal}} station with one platform for departures and arrivals and stabling for passenger traffic. The station building {{was on the}} north side of the tracks. At the end of the platform on the east side of the station there was a shed for wagons, locomotives and freight and a <b>mail</b> <b>handling</b> facility. After the construction of the through station workshop facilities were built on the site. The <b>mail</b> <b>handling</b> facility became a residence for rail officials and the passenger station building was used for administrative purposes. It was destroyed in an air raid in 1945. One of the buildings (Bahnhofstrasse 7) built as a workshop in the mid-1850s has been preserved and is a listed building.|$|E

50|$|The building's {{principal}} designing architect was Arthur Blakeslee, and it {{was built}} in 1937 with funding from the Public Works Administration (PWA), following that body's guidelines for design and construction. The building's location on a side street (as opposed to a more prominent corner or main street location) was an evolutionary step in the PWA's practices for post office location, allowing the <b>mail</b> <b>handling</b> area to be accessed from the side rather than the rear.|$|E
