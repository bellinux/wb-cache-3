5|$|The {{fighting}} at Buna {{ended on}} 23 January, freeing up aircraft to support Wau, and 52 brand-new Dakotas of the US 317th Troop Carrier Group {{had arrived in}} Australia, their movement from the United States having been expedited in response to urgent requests from General Douglas MacArthur arising from the Buna fighting. After a quick <b>maintenance</b> <b>check,</b> they were flown up to Port Moresby to help the 374th Troop Carrier Group fly the 17th Infantry Brigade into Wau. This meant that up to 40 aircraft were now available daily.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1940, I. Gruppe {{was moved}} to a forward {{airfield}} at Grandvilliers in preparation for missions over the Channel Coast, but the following day, all Bf109s were sent to Wiesbaden, via Brussels, for a thorough <b>maintenance</b> <b>check.</b> The overhaul detachment arrived in Wiesbaden {{in the late afternoon}} and the pilots were sent on home leave. The cease-fire of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 went into effect on 25 June 1940, ending the Battle of France. During the French campaign, Lützow flew 64 combat missions and claimed nine victories. Under his leadership, I. Gruppe {{was one of the most}} successful units in this campaign. It was credited with 88 aerial victories for the loss of six pilots killed and ten Bf109s destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. The plane {{was scheduled to}} depart from Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications that anything {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type. The plane was carrying no unusual payload such as freight or mail and the plane was not due for its next regular <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> for another 21 days, on 31 January 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise {{arrives at}} Starbase74 for a routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>check.</b> Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) and {{two pairs of}} small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars' claimed upgrades to the holodeck and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet (Carolyn McCormick), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, {{but also by the}} level of sophistication in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is amazed by the simulation.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} time an Airbus A340 series was {{involved}} in a crash, ending its 14-year clean record. The aircraft involved entered service in 1999 and had had its last <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> in France on 5 July 2005. It made 3,711 flights for a total of 28,426 flight hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Boeing 747-412, registered as 9V-SPK with manufacturer's serial number 28023, powered by four Pratt & Whitney PW4056 engines. It was the 1099th Boeing 747 built and had been delivered to Singapore Airlines on 21 January 1997. It had its last <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> on 16 September 2000, and had no defects.|$|E

25|$|On 10 October 1957, the Windscale Piles {{were shut}} down {{following}} a fire in Pile 1 during a routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>check,</b> which destroyed the core and released an estimated 750 terabecquerels (20,000 curies) of radioactive material, including 22 TBq of Cs-137 and 740 TBq of I-131 into the shafts. Thanks to innovative filters installed by Nobel laureate Sir John Cockcroft 95% of the material was captured. As a precautionary measure, milk from surrounding farming areas was destroyed. Following the fire, Pile 1 was unserviceable, and Pile 2, although undamaged by the fire, was shut down as a precaution.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft, {{destroyed}} in the accident, was a Fairchild SA 227-BC Metro III, c/n BC-789B, registration EC-ITP. It was owned by a Spanish bank and leased to Líneas Aéreas de Andalucía, known as Air Lada based in Seville, Spain. The aircraft was subleased to Flightline S.L. {{and was on the}} Air operator's certificate (AOC) of Flightline, which is based in Barcelona, Spain. Tickets were sold by a company called Manx2, which was based in the Isle of Man. The aircraft was 19 {{years old at the time}} of the accident, and it had undergone a <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> in the week prior to the accident.|$|E

The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines {{and the most}} comprehensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Regularly-scheduled [...] 600-flight hour, [...] 2200-flight hour, and 760-day {{maintenance}} checks {{were completed}} {{in the six months}} prior to the accident, all with no discrepancies. The aircraft's last major <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> was on September 22, 2014, in Jacksonville, Florida and included, among other things, tests of the autobrake, anti-skid and auto-spoiler systems. The aircraft's last overnight service check was completed March 2, 2015 in Tampa, Florida.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the right}} engine had backfired during the <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> in San Juan, 13 new spark plugs (AC-LS-87) were installed. The AC-LS-87 {{sparkplug}} accounted for 30 of the 36 {{required for the}} engine to run. This type of sparkplug was not approved {{for use in the}} Curtiss C-46A by the engine manufacturer or the United States Air Forces (which specifically prohibited the use of this type of sparkplug in the C-46A's Pratt and Whitney engines). Furthermore, the rear right engine sparkplugs suffered from extreme heat damage. This was linked to the right engine ignition switch found in the left magneto position, only allowing the rear sparkplugs to fire. Finally, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) determined [...] "the spark plug terminals for this engine were found to be oily and dirty and spark plug electrodes were found to have too much clearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, Allegiant {{purchased}} six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for {{flights to}} Hawaii with {{the delivery of}} the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii. Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton. [...] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. [...] Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly <b>maintenance</b> <b>check</b> that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient on the aircraft they fly to Hawaii.|$|E
