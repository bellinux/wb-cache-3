5|$|Officials {{distributed}} emergency relief {{items to}} the affected areas, including rice, sugar, soap, candles, matches and water purification tablets. In Morondava in Toliara Province, the government distributed 4tons of rice seed, while in Ambatolampy in Antananarivo Province, the government sent 10tons of rice; additionally, the World Food Programme sent 80tons of flour to the nation. The combined {{efforts of the}} United Nations and aid agencies repaired the schools and distributed <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> the families affected by the disaster.

5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E
5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas. By 12weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2million (2003USD, ($ USD)).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkennessâ€”both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Hurricane Dennis, 190,000people {{were ordered to}} evacuate, though many opted not to. Jackson County issued a mandatory evacuation for its residents, while Hancock County called for a voluntary evacuation. Governor Haley Barbour issued a state of emergency, and 600National Guard soldiers were on standby. Harrison County issued a mandatory evacuation for residents living in low-lying areas, and ordered the closing of its casinos. Also, the Red Cross provided 60mobile canteens capable of serving 30,000hot <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> staging areas in Hattiesburg and Jackson. 32law officials were sent to Hattiesburg to assist with traffic control near the intersection with I-59 and U.S. Route 49. Additionally, a horse park in Starkville was caring for over 50horses belonging to residents who were forced to evacuate and had no other location for them.|$|E

40|$|Mineral {{content and}} {{bioaccessibility}} of 4 home-made composite meals and 6 commercial ready-to-eat (RTE) foods were assessed. Bioaccessibility of Fe from composite meals based oil 4 staple cereals ranged from 1. 5 % (finger millet <b>meal)</b> <b>to</b> 4. 7 % (wheat meal), while that of Zn, from 8. 5 % (rice <b>meal)</b> <b>to</b> 0. 31 % (sorghum meal) and of Ca, from 5. 1 % (wheat <b>meal)</b> <b>to</b> 9. 8 % (rice meal). Rice and finger millet meals provided more bioaccessible Zn and Ca, while wheat and sorghum meals had more bioaccessible Fe. Commercial RTE foods provided more bioaccessible Zn and Ca than the corresponding whole meals. Thus, intake of minerals is not compromised by consuming the traditional RTE foods instead of regular home-cooked meals...|$|R

5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm, {{the first time a}} launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston. Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm. In New Iberia, Louisiana, hardware stores ran out of stock, and businesses in Lafayette, Louisiana reported similar shortages.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for the Townsville area, making an initial $7,000 in emergency aid available for distribution among 84 individuals left homeless. Immediately after the storm, the Salvation Army began collecting and distributing donated clothing, while providing hot <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> hundreds of destitute storm victims. Australian Prime Minister William McMahon soon traveled to Townsville to assess the damage and authorise the distribution of emergency grants for affected residents. At the end of December, officials announced that {{the state and federal}} governments would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants, ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,000 for pensioners; for the latter, higher allocations to cover the full cost of rebuilding homes were soon considered. The Townsville City Council received a special $25,000 grant with the goal of repairing schools {{for the start of the}} new academic year. By 27 December, $150,000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout Queensland sought assistance for the disaster area. Western Australia provided $72,000 of relief funding, while Tasmania contributed $2,000. The Australian federal government reimbursed Queensland for an estimated $5.5â€“6 million spent by the state on recovery.|$|E

5|$|The Capitol Hill station's {{design was}} {{finalized}} in 2007 and 2008, during {{a series of}} public hearings and meetings with the city's design commission. Businesses and residents at the station site were moved after Sound Transit acquired properties in 2008, leaving vacant buildings that were temporarily filled with pieces of art coordinated by Sound Transit. Salvaging and recycling of materials in the vacant buildings began in late 2008, including a community event to remove small plants for re-planting by neighborhood residents; approximately 90 percent of material was recycled, and proceeds {{from the sale of}} scrap metal were used to provide hot <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> the homeless. Demolition of buildings on the station site began in March 2009, shortly before the formal groundbreaking for the University Link project, and was completed by August. Among the 20 demolished buildings were a three-story apartment building, a used book store, the Espresso Vivace coffee shop, a nail salon, and a copy shop. Many of the displaced and nearby businesses moved to the northern end of the Broadway district during construction, relying on mitigation funds from Sound Transit and the neighborhood's chamber of commerce.|$|E

5|$|The George McGovernâ€“Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the floods}} in Costa Rica, the country's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims. The {{government}} advised residents not to drink {{water out of}} fear it could be polluted from the flooding. A state of emergency was declared on October18 due to the effects in Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, officials deployed about 3,000soldiers to assist in flood operations. The World Food Programme provided about 8tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding. Then-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October19. In Honduras, pre-positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and medical kits, raising fears for the spread of disease. The World Food Programme provided about 58tons of food to 5,500families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1,300Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000people. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided <b>meals</b> <b>to</b> about 9,000people following the floods.|$|E
