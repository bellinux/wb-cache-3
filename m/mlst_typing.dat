50|$|To {{strike the}} balance between the {{acceptable}} identification power, time and cost for the strain typing, about seven to eight house-keeping genes are commonly used in the laboratories. Quoting Staphylococcus aureus as an example, seven housekeeping genes are used in <b>MLST</b> <b>typing.</b> These genes include carbamate kinase (arcC), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE), glycerol kinase (glpF), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqiL) as specified by the MLST website. However, {{it is not uncommon}} for up to ten housekeeping genes to be used. For Vibrio vulnificus, the housekeeping genes used are glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (glp), DNA gyrase, subunit B (gyrB), malate-lactate dehydrogenase (mdh), methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG), phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (purM), threonine dehyrogenase (dtdS), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysA), transhydrogenase alpha subunit (pntA), dihydroorotase (pyrC) and tryptophanase (tnaA). Thus both the number and type of housekeeping genes interrogated by MLST may differ from species to species.|$|E

In this study, we hypothesized a high prevalence of A. baumanni ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) among all collected isolates. Methods: A. baumannii isolates (n = 107) from ICU (Intensive care unit) of local hospitals in Makkah were phenotypi-cally and genotypically characterized. The identity and antibiotic susceptibility of A. baumannii strains were deter-mined using the Vitek- 2 system. The identified ESBL producers were further analyzed by PCR and sequencing followed by <b>MLST</b> <b>typing.</b> blaTEM, blaSHV, and the blaCTX-M-group genes 1, 2, 8, 9, and 25 were investigated. Furthermore, blaOXA 51 -like and blaOXA 23 -like genes were also examined in the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates. Results: Our data indicated a high prevalence of A. baumannii ESBL producers among the collected strains. Of the 107 A. baumannii isolates, 94 % {{were found to be}} resistant to cefepime and ceftazidime, and aztreonam using the Vitek 2 system. The genes detected encoded TEM, OXA- 51 -like and OXA- 23 -like enzymes, and CTX-M-group proteins 1, 2, 8, 9, and 25. <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> identified eight sequence type (ST) groups. The most dominant STs were ST 195 and ST 557 and all of them belong to worldwide clonal complex (CC) 2. Conclusions: This study has shown that there is a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii. The diversity of STs may suggest that new ESBL strains are constantly emerging. The molecular diversity of the ESBL genes in A. baumannii {{may have contributed to the}} increased antimicrobial resistance among all isolates...|$|E
40|$|A multilocus {{sequence}} typing (MLST) {{scheme was}} established and evaluated for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the etiologic agent of enzootic pneumonia in swine {{with the aim}} of defining strains. Putative target genes were selected by genome sequence comparisons. Out of 12 housekeeping genes chosen and experimentally validated, the 7 genes efp, metG, pgiB, recA, adk, rpoB, and tpiA were finally used to establish the MLST scheme. Their usefulness was assessed individually and in combination using a set of well-defined field samples and strains of M. hyopneumoniae. A reduction to the three targets showing highest variation (adk, rpoB, and tpiA) was possible resulting in the same number of sequence types as using the seven targets. The established MLST approach was compared with the recently described typing method using the serine-rich repeat motif-encoding region of the p 146 gene. There was coherence between the two methods, but MLST resulted in a slightly higher resolution. Farms recognized to be affected by enzootic pneumonia were always associated with a single M. hyopneumoniae clone, which in most cases differed from farm to farm. However, farms in close geographic or operational contact showed identical clones as defined by <b>MLST</b> <b>typing.</b> Population analysis showed that recombination in M. hyopneumoniae occurs and that strains are very diverse with only limited clonality observed. Elaborate classical MLST schemes using multiple targets for M. hyopneumoniae might therefore be of limited value.

The isolates represented pairs or larger sets from individual sources, which allowed {{the determination of}} strain diversity within patients. A comparison of replicate sequence data determined a reproducibility threshold for regarding isolates as MLST indistinguishable. For 36 isolate sets, <b>MLST</b> and ABC <b>typing</b> showed indistinguishable or highly related strain types among isolates from different sites or from the same site at different times from each patient. This observation included 11 sets {{with at least one}} isolate from a blood culture and a nonsterile site from the same patient. For one patient, strain replacement was evidenced in the form of two sets of isolates from different hospital admissions where the strain types within each set were nearly identical but where the two sets differed both by <b>MLST</b> and ABC <b>typing.</b> <b>MLST</b> therefore confirms the existing view of C. albicans strain carriage.

Among isolate sets that showed major strain type differences, some isolates could be excluded as likely examples of handling errors during storage. However, for a minority of isolates, intermittent differences in ABC type for tightly clustered <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> and intermittent appearances of MTL homozygosity lead us to propose that some C. albicans isolates, or all isolates under yet-to-be-determined conditions, maintain a high level of genetic diversity by mechanisms such as recombination, gene conversion, or chromosomal ploidy change...|$|R

A set of 25 Salmonella enterica isolates, representing five clinically relevant serotypes (serotypes Agona, Heidelberg, Schwarzengrund, Typhimurium, and Typhimurium var. Copenhagen) was initially used to develop a multilocus sequence <b>typing</b> (<b>MLST)</b> scheme for Salmonella targeting seven housekeeping and virulence genes (panB, fimA, aceK, mdh, icdA, manB, and spaN). A total of eight <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> were found among the 25 isolates sequenced. A good correlation between <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> and Salmonella serotypes was observed; only one serotype Typhimurium var. Copenhagen isolate displayed an <b>MLST</b> <b>type</b> otherwise typical for serotype Typhimurium isolates. Since manB, fimA, and mdh allowed for the highest subtype discrimination among the initial 25 isolates, we chose these three genes to perform DNA sequencing of an additional 41 Salmonella isolates representing a larger diversity of serotypes. This “three-gene sequence typing scheme” allowed discrimination of 25 sequence types (STs) among a total of 66 isolates; STs correlated well with serotypes and allowed within-serotype differentiation for 9 of the 12 serotypes characterized. Phylogenetic analyses showed that serotypes Kentucky and Newport could each be separated into two distinct, statistically well supported evolutionary lineages. Our results show that a three-gene sequence typing scheme allows for accurate serotype prediction and for limited subtype discrimination among clinically relevant serotypes of Salmonella. Three-gene sequence typing also supports the notion that Salmonella serotypes represent both monophyletic and polyphyletic lineages...|$|R

The use of molecular typing methods is essential for determining the origin of the isolates, their clonal relations, and also epidemiological investigations. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant MRSA investigate the accessory gene regulator (agr) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types and perform multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentration of MRSA isolates was determined for vancomycin and daptomycin. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-nine MRSA isolates were collected from Tertiary Care Hospitals in Coimbatore. Disk diffusion method was employed to assess the sensitivity of MRSA isolates to selected antibiotics and genetic analysis was performed using SCCmec, agr, and <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction strategy. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using Ezy MIC (vancomycin) and Biomerieux (daptomycin) E-test strip. Results: Of 259 MRSA isolates, 209 (80. 7 %) were confirmed as methicillin resistant. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern revealed that all the MRSA isolates were 100 % sensitive to linezolid, rifampicin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. MIC results showed that of 209 MRSA isolates, 10 were found to be vancomycin intermediate S. aureus and 100 % of the MRSA isolates were daptomycin-susceptible. The agr group I and SCCmec Type III were the major type among MRSA isolates. In addition to these <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> revealed the prevalence of sequence type (ST) 239 (SLV of ST 8) among the MRSA isolates. Conclusion: This study confirms that ST 239 (Brazilian clone) of MRSA is predominant in this region which is responsible for the hospital-acquired MRSA infections. Thus, the study also suggests that vancomycin and daptomycin can still be used as an alternative drug for treating severe MRSA infections...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 35 - 44). Candida {{species are}} the most common opportunistic pathogens in debilitated or immunocompromised hosts and cause systemic candidiasis, which has high rates of morbidity and mortality. Most of these infections are nosocomial and raise the issue of hospital hygiene. As such the identification and subtyping of Candida species is epidemiologically important for recognizing outbreaks of infection, detecting cross-transmission, determining the source of the infection, and recognizing particularly virulent strains, or detecting the emergence of drug resistant strains. In this study our objective is to compare Candida albicans hospital identification rates with conventional laboratory employed methods such as API, CHROMagar and germ tube formation and a more reliable molecular method such as ITS typing. Furthermore our aim was to assess biofilm-forming capacities with drug resistance profiles and correlate them with <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> of isolates. ITS typing was performed for 75 isolates and the misidentification rate for each method is considered significant: 9. 3 % for API and CHROMagar, and 17. 3 % for the hospital. Moreover, antifungal susceptibility testing was performed for 4 antifungal drugs encompassing different antifungal classes, and antifungal resistance to 3 and to the 4 drugs was found to occur amongst 25 % of isolates tested which was unexpected and raises serious questions concerning the methods of treatment. Interestingly some strains with significant biofilm forming capabilities correlated well with strains that were multidrug resistant and such strains grouped closely together in a neighbor-joining tree generated by <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> indicating phylogenetic relatedness or strain microevolution or recurrent infection. In conclusion, this pilot study gives insight about many aspect of Candida albicans isolates circulating in hospitals, unfortunately the small sample size and lack of information about patient history, preclude any firm conclusions. 1 bound copy: xvi, 51 leaves; ill.

Methods: A total of 14 SNPs were selected following in silico analysis of available N. gonorrhoeae MLST sequence data. Real-time PCR methods were developed for characterization of each SNP and applied to 86 N. gonorrhoeae isolates exhibiting a range of ceftriaxone MICs. Twenty-one isolates had previously been characterized by MLST. The ability of the real-time PCR methods to generate SNP profiles and of the 14 SNP profiles to predict <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> were assessed. Results: In silico analysis of the 217 different <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> available on the Neisseria web site showed 181 different 14 SNP profiles (Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s index of diversity = 0. 998). When the real-time PCR methods were applied to the isolates, 29 different 14 SNP profiles were obtained for 83 isolates. Predicted <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> were consistent with those for the 21 isolates previously characterized by MLST. For 46 isolates with raised ceftriaxone MICs (≥ 0. 03 mg/L), there were 14 different 14 SNP profiles observed, with two profiles accounting {{for more than half of}} these isolates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Avian {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, {{which results}} in significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. However, the diversity between isolates remains poorly understood. Here, a total of 272 APEC isolates collected from the United Kingdom (UK), Italy and Germany were characterised using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting 22 equally weighted factors covering virulence genes, R-type and phylogroup. Following these analysis, 95 of the selected strains were further analysed using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: The most prevalent phylogroups were B 2 (47 %) and A 1 (22 %), although there were national differences with Germany presenting group B 2 (35. 3 %), Italy presenting group A 1 (53. 3 %) and UK presenting group B 2 (56. 1 %) as the most prevalent. R-type R 1 was the most frequent type (55 %) among APEC, but multiple R-types were also frequent (26. 8 %). Following compilation of all the PCR data which covered a total of 15 virulence genes, {{it was possible to}} build a similarity tree using each PCR result unweighted to produce 9 distinct groups. The average number of virulence genes was 6 - 8 per isolate, but no positive association was found between phylogroup and number or type of virulence genes. A total of 95 isolates representing each of these 9 groupings were genome sequenced and analysed for in silico serotype, Multilocus Sequence <b>Typing</b> (<b>MLST),</b> and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The UK isolates showed the greatest variability in terms of serotype and MLST compared with German and Italian isolates, whereas the lowest prevalence of AMR was found for German isolates. Similarity trees were compiled using sequencing data and notably single nucleotide polymorphism data generated ten distinct geno-groups. The frequency of geno-groups across Europe comprised 26. 3 % belonging to Group 8 representing serogroups O 2, O 4, O 18 and <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> ST 95, ST 140, ST 141, ST 428, ST 1618 and others, 18. 9 % belonging to Group 1 (serogroups O 78 and <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> ST 23, ST 2230), 15. 8 % belonging to Group 10 (serogroups O 8, O 45, O 91, O 125 ab and variable <b>MLST</b> <b>types),</b> 14. 7 % belonging to Group 7 (serogroups O 4, O 24, O 35, O 53, O 161 and <b>MLST</b> <b>type</b> ST 117) and 13. 7 % belonging to Group 9 (serogroups O 1, O 16, O 181 and others and <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> ST 10, ST 48 and others). The other groups (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) each contained relatively few strains. However, for some of the genogroups (e. g. groups 6 and 7) partial overlap with SNPs grouping and PCR grouping (matching PCR groups 8 (13 isolates on 22) and 1 (14 isolates on 16) were observable). However, {{it was not possible to}} obtain a clear correlation between genogroups and unweighted PCR groupings. This may be due to the genome plasticity of E. coli that enables strains to carry the same virulence factors even if the overall genotype is substantially different. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion to be drawn from the lack of correlations is that firstly, APEC are very diverse and secondly, it is not possible to rely on any one or more basic molecular or phenotypic tests to define APEC with clarity, reaffirming the need for whole genome analysis approaches which we describe here. This study highlights the presence of previously unreported serotypes and MLSTs for APEC in Europe. Moreover, it is a first step on a cautious reconsideration of the merits of classical identification criteria such as R typing, phylogrouping and serotyping...|$|R

Fourteen methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were subjected to an extensive genotype characterization, including SCCmec, dru, spa, PFGE and <b>MLST</b> <b>typing.</b> Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and resistance genes were detected by PCR. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of four biocides [chlorhexidine acetate (CHA), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), triclosan (TCL) and glutaraldehyde (GLA) ] were determined following the recommendations of document NF EN 1040. The presence of qac and sh-fabI genes was investigated by PCR. Several antimicrobial resistance patterns and genes were detected. When MRS strains were exposed for a longer period of time, a lower concentration of the biocide was needed to achieve lethality. TCL had the lowest MBC values. All MBC values were lower than the recommended in-use concentrations for veterinary medicine. S. haemolyticus and S. cohnii subsp. cohnii carried plasmid-borne qacA and sh-fabI or qacB and a qacH-like genes, respectively. Biocides appear to be a reliable antiseptic option against MRS, since even in the presence of bacterial efflux mechanisms, the recommended concentration is much higher than the in vitro MBC...|$|E

Population studies revealed no strong correlation between CPS type and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) cluster, with the remarkable exception of the worldwide spread of hypervirulent GBS CC 17, which were all until recently CPS type III. Methods.  A total of 965 GBS strains from invasive infection isolated in France were CPS typed {{and the presence of}} the CC 17 -specific surface protein encoding gene hvgA gene was investigated. Three hvgA-positive GBS strains screened were surprisingly CPS type IV and thus further characterized by <b>MLST</b> <b>typing,</b> pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and whole genome sequencing. Results.  MLST and PFGE demonstrated a capsular switching from CPS type III to IV within the highly homogeneous GBS CC 17. Sequence analysis revealed that this capsular switch was due to the exchange of a 35. 5 -kb DNA fragment containing the entire cps operon. Conclusions.  This work shows that GBS CC 17 hypervirulent strains have switched one of their main vaccine targets. Thus, continued surveillance of GBS population remains of the utmost importance during clinical trials of conjugate GBS vaccines...|$|E

The survey for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage among HCWs has mostly been conducted to investigate outbreaks or endemics. Community-associated MRSA are prevalent among children in Taiwan. We conducted this study {{to better understand the}} carriage rate of MRSA among pediatricians in non-outbreak situations in Taiwan,. Methods: A total of 220 pediatricians from Taiwan who attended the annual meeting of Taiwan Pediatric Association in April, 2010 were recruited to participate in this study and were sampled from the nares for the detection of MRSA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and further by culture. The following molecular analyses were performed, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (<b>MLST),</b> <b>typing</b> of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. Results: MRSA was detected from 15 attendees (6. 8 %) by PCR. MRSA-colonized attendees had a significantly lower rate (0. 041) of working in the medical center, while borderline significantly higher rate of working in the Regional Hospital (p= 0. 056), than those without MRSA colonization.

Among 31 carbapenem resistant strains, we have detected three carbapenem resistance genes: 28 carried the blaOXA- 23 gene, 1 the blaOXA- 24 gene and 2 strains the blaOXA- 58 gene. This is the first detection of blaOXA- 23 and blaOXA- 24 in Lebanon.

Methods: PFGE and multilocus sequence <b>typing</b> (<b>MLST)</b> genotypes, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, the presence of enterococcal surface protein (esp) and hyaluronidase (hyl) genes and conjugation frequencies were determined. In addition, Tn 1546 elements were characterized. Results: PFGE and MLST analysis revealed the presence of 31 and 6 different genotypes, respectively. Further, three new ST types were discovered. Ninety-seven percent (33 / 34) of the isolates were associated with clonal complex 17 (CC 17), with all isolates but one being resistant to ampicillin and all isolates being susceptible to linezolid. The esp and hyl genes were found in 44 % (15 / 34) and 53 % (18 / 34) of the isolates, respectively. Tn 1546 analysis revealed that the isolates belonged to five different groups, including two new lineages. The IS-element insertions described did not abolish the transfer of VanA resistance. Conclusions: VanA vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates obtained from Saudi Arabian hospitals include CC 17 <b>MLST</b> <b>types,</b> a clonal cluster associated with E. faecium nosocomial infection worldwide. Novel E. faecium <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> are circulating in Saudi Arabia, as well as novel Tn 1546 types.

40|$|Background: The aim {{of present}} study was {{evaluation}} and comparison of widely used molecular techniques including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi locus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus aureus protein A typing (spa), Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome typing (SCCmec), and SCCmec typing with recently introduced method using direct repeat unit (dru) sequencing in the hyper-variable region of the SCCmec cassette for clustering and discrimination of MRSA isolates. Material and Methods: Out of 389 already molecularly established methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates 61 representative samples were subjected to PFGE and dru typing methods according to guideline. Results: The results showed that isolates were typed by PFGE typing, <b>MLST</b> <b>typing,</b> spa typing, SCCmec was typing and dru typing to 7, 6, 6, 12, 19 different types respectively. Evaluation of the discriminatory power for each method identified dru typing and PFGE as the most discriminatory methods. Conclusion: Although the discriminatory ability of dru typing, especially with closely related MRSA ST 239 strains underscore its utility as a feasible and cheap method in epidemiological investigation of MRSA, we suggest {{the use of the}} conjugation of dru typing and PFGE typing for epidemiological surveillance studies, since this combination provides more discriminatory and typeability which is useful for the control of nosocomial infection...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} whether multilocus sequence types (MLST) of Campylobacter from poultry in 2 {{farms in}} Grenada, West Indies, differed by farm, antimicrobial resistance and farm antibiotic use. Farm A used fluoroquinolones {{in the water}} and Farm B used tetracyclines. The E-test was used to determine resistance of isolates to seven antibiotics. PCR of the IpxA gene confirmed species and MLST was used to characterize 38 isolates. All isolates were either C. jejuni or C. coli. Farm antibiotic use directly correlated with antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates. Almost 80 % of the isolates from Farm A were fluoroquinolone resistant and 17. 9 % of the isolates from Farm B were fluoroquinolone resistant. All Campylobacter isolates from Farm A were tetracycline sensitive, whereas 35. 7 % of isolates from Farm B were tetracycline resistant. Six previously recognized sequence types (STs) and 2 novel STs were identified. Previously recognized STs were those overwhelmingly reported from poultry and humans globally. Isolates with the same ST did not always have the same antibiotic resistance profile. There was little ST overlap between the farms suggesting that within-farm transmission of Campylobacter genotypes may dominate. <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> was useful for tracking Campylobacter spp. among poultry units and can help elucidate Campylobacter host-species population structure and its relevance to human health...|$|E

The aim of this study was determining the enterotoxins A, C, and TSST- 1 and molecular characterization of S. aureus strains with PFGE and <b>MLST</b> <b>typing</b> methods. Materials and methods: In the present study during the sixmonths sampling, fifty S. aureus strains were isolated from patients admitted to Al-Zahra university hospital. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Multiplex PCR for detection of enterotoxin A, C and TSST- 1, pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for molecular typing. Results : In antibiogram the highest and lowest percentage of resistance was belonged to tetracycline and rifampin respectively. Multiplex PCR indicated that 30 % of the strains harbored sea and 34 % harbored sec genes. However, only 4 % of our collected isolates had tsst gene. In PFGE method analysis on all S. aureus strains, a total of 19 different patterns were identified. Nine various sequence types in 27 selected S. aureus isolates were identified by MLST. Conclusions : Present study indicates a possible higher variability among our S. aureus strains by two different molecular typing methods; nevertheless four main common types (CT 1, CT 7, CT 9, and CT 11) with at least one toxin genes were determined...|$|E
40|$|Background Avian {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, {{which results}} in significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. However, the diversity between isolates remains poorly understood. Here, a total of 272 APEC isolates collected from the United Kingdom (UK), Italy and Germany were characterised using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting 22 equally weighted factors covering virulence genes, R-type and phylogroup. Following these analysis, 95 of the selected strains were further analysed using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Results The most prevalent phylogroups were B 2 (47 %) and A 1 (22 %), although there were national differences with Germany presenting group B 2 (35. 3 %), Italy presenting group A 1 (53. 3 %) and UK presenting group B 2 (56. 1 %) as the most prevalent. R-type R 1 was the most frequent type (55 %) among APEC, but multiple R-types were also frequent (26. 8 %). Following compilation of all the PCR data which covered a total of 15 virulence genes, {{it was possible to}} build a similarity tree using each PCR result unweighted to produce 9 distinct groups. The average number of virulence genes was 6 - 8 per isolate, but no positive association was found between phylogroup and number or type of virulence genes. A total of 95 isolates representing each of these 9 groupings were genome sequenced and analysed for in silico serotype, Multilocus Sequence <b>Typing</b> (<b>MLST),</b> and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The UK isolates showed the greatest variability in terms of serotype and MLST compared with German and Italian isolates, whereas the lowest prevalence of AMR was found for German isolates. Similarity trees were compiled using sequencing data and notably single nucleotide polymorphism data generated ten distinct geno-groups. The frequency of geno-groups across Europe comprised 26. 3 % belonging to Group 8 representing serogroups O 2, O 4, O 18 and <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> ST 95, ST 140, ST 141, ST 428, ST 1618 and others, 18. 9 % belonging to Group 1 (serogroups O 78 and <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> ST 23, ST 2230), 15. 8 % belonging to Group 10 (serogroups O 8, O 45, O 91, O 125 ab and variable <b>MLST</b> <b>types),</b> 14. 7 % belonging to Group 7 (serogroups O 4, O 24, O 35, O 53, O 161 and <b>MLST</b> <b>type</b> ST 117) and 13. 7 % belonging to Group 9 (serogroups O 1, O 16, O 181 and others and <b>MLST</b> 51 <b>types</b> ST 10, ST 48 and others). The other groups (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) each contained relatively few strains.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} sets of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected longitudinally from different flocks of broiler breeders, meconium of one-day-old broilers from theses breeder flocks, as well as from these broiler flocks before slaughter. Methods: Five sets of ESBL-producing E. coli were studied by multi-locus sequence <b>typing</b> (<b>MLST),</b> phylogenetic grouping, PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) and resistance profiling. The blaCTX-M- 1 -harbouring plasmids of one set (pHV 295. 1, pHV 114. 1 and pHV 292. 1) were fully sequenced and subjected to comparative analysis. Results: Eleven different <b>MLST</b> sequence <b>types</b> (ST) were identified with ST 1056 the predominant one, isolated in all five sets either on the broiler breeder or meconium level. Plasmid sequencing revealed that blaCTX-M- 1 was carried by highly similar IncI 1 /ST 3 plasmids that were 105 076 bp, 110 997 bp and 117 269 bp in size, respectively. Conclusions: The fact that genetically similar IncI 1 /ST 3 plasmids were found in ESBL-producing E. coli of different <b>MLST</b> <b>types</b> isolated at the different levels in the broiler production pyramid provides strong evidence for a vertical transmission of these plasmids from a common source (nucleus poultry flocks) ...|$|R
