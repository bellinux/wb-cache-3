25|$|After a given {{discipline}} {{has changed}} from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a scientific revolution or a paradigm shift. It is often this final conclusion, {{the result of the}} long process, that is <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> the term paradigm shift is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.|$|E
25|$|In Big Brother 2012 {{there was}} a small, {{rectangular}} shaped room, linked to the lounge. This room was the Naughty Corner. This room {{was similar to the}} Punishment Room of the sixth and seventh series. The eighth and ninth series' featured no fines system at all. Instead, Big Brother used the original striking system more frequently that <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> a housemate received three strikes they were evicted.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting {{a drink of water}} are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between cognitive and behavioral science.|$|E

500|$|The CDC {{agrees to}} allow Olivia {{to enter the}} {{building}} and use the air ventilation system to spread some fentanyl gas, which will gain them time while the cure is synthesized. While inside, Peter attacks her, but Olivia is able to turn the air on, successfully knocking out the building's occupants. Peter and everyone else are successfully cured. Astrid later approaches Walter and asks what he <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> he said he couldn't let Peter die again, to which he responds by saying [...] "some things {{are meant to be}} left alone." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{scoffed at}} White's {{claim that the}} calls to {{activism}} were possibly instrumental in creating a predisposition to offend: [...] "The most one finds is letters advocating legislative action to liberalize obscenity laws, letters which could easily be ignored or thrown away ... Nor did the Government claim to be organizing a civil disobedience movement, which would protest the pornography laws by breaking them." [...] It {{was up to the}} jury, she said, to decide what Jacobson <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> he said on the stand that he wanted to see [...] "what all the trouble and hysteria was about", and they had done so.|$|E
500|$|Bridget Daley of Hollyscoop was {{impressed}} with the song saying, [...] "It’s super beat, and now we understand what RedOne <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> he told Hollyscoop how much we were going to love Nicole’s 'new' sound!" [...] However, Becky Bain of Idolator thought the [...] "pulsating dance song" [...] was underwhelming. [...] "We have to admit, we’re not bowled over by this one, which pretty much follows a standard, predictable dance-pop formula from the double shout-out at the start to the 'woosh'ing fade-out finish". However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable, [...] "then again, since when has the Hot 100 shyed away from generic pop tunes we’ve heard over and over again? This one could go either way, folks." ...|$|E

500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with {{a kick in the}} shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, you look like a guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E
500|$|Tensions also {{developed}} between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones {{soon after the}} election. During the campaign, Jones {{was quoted as saying}} that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a [...] "yes man" [...] for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson {{said he did not know}} what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> he said he did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and {{there had to be a}} reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E

500|$|Ralph M. Cole, {{a member}} of the golf team of 1926-1928, later wrote of a humorous {{incident}} involving the septuagenarian Coach Trueblood. Cole recalled: [...] "As golf coach he could add very little about the mechanics of the game. But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed, and which he drilled into us at every practice session. It was: 'Up and out in two, boys.' As any golfer would know, it <b>meant,</b> <b>when</b> hitting a short approach shot, get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt. [...] Now for the humorous part of that admonition. We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday. The Professor was to call us at 4:30a.m. to catch a 5:30 train for Urbana. Well, he got confused on our room number and awakened a man who called the front desk and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4:30a.m. and shouting, 'Up and out in two boys!' [...] We did make the train, anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1909, the British Parliament {{authorized}} {{an additional}} four capital ships, holding out hope Germany {{would be willing}} to negotiate a treaty about battleship numbers. If no such solution could be found, an additional four ships would be laid down in 1910. Even this compromise solution <b>meant</b> (<b>when</b> taken together with some social reforms) raising taxes enough to prompt a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four [...] super-dreadnoughts, and augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period, Germany laid down only three ships, giving the United Kingdom a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve demonstrated by their construction programme led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. The Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, but talks foundered on the question on whether British Commonwealth battlecruisers {{should be included in the}} count, as well as non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of ownership of Alsace-Lorraine.|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

2500|$|The Band also {{inspired}} Grace Potter, of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, to {{form the}} band in 2002. In {{an interview with the}} Montreal Gazette, Potter said, [...] "The Band blew my mind.

2500|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the fact that there is more than one noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution is obtained if balls are sampled one by one in such a way that there is competition between the balls. Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution is obtained if the balls are sampled simultaneously or independently of each other. Unfortunately, both distributions are known in the literature as [...] "the" [...] noncentral hypergeometric distribution. It is important to be specific about which distribution is <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> using this name.|$|E

25|$|At Breitengüßbach and Zapfendorf {{stations}} between Bamberg and Ebensfeld, {{the access}} to the platforms was over a passenger level crossing, which <b>meant</b> that <b>when</b> regional services stopped, the track next to the station building had to be blocked {{for the safety of}} passengers.|$|R
2500|$|... 2. Lack of {{historical}} authenticity. Similarly, {{it has been}} noted that the ḥijāb as worn today is historically alien to the Islamic world. This is illustrated by an incident involving Gamal Abdel Nasser. During his rule as the 2nd President of Egypt (1956-1970), Nasser was given a list of demands by the Supreme Leader of the [...] Brotherhood {{as part of a}} process of political reconciliation. This list included “imposing ḥijāb on Muslim women”: “The audience members didn't understand what the word 'ḥijāb' <b>meant.</b> <b>When</b> Nasser explained that the Brotherhood wanted Egyptian women to wear a headscarf, the audience members burst out laughing.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One similar example Breyer cited was the 1796 case Ware v. Hylton, which, Breyer wrote, was {{illustrative of}} what [...] "the Founders <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> they wrote [...] that 'all Treaties ... {{shall be the}} supreme Law of the Land.'" [...] In Ware v. Hylton, the Supreme Court had agreed with a British {{creditor}} that a provision of the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which had been ratified by the United States's Congress of the Confederation, overruled a Virginia state law regarding the repayment of debts to Britons; and, as the treaty was [...] "addressed to the Judicial Branch", Congress had not had to enact a domestic law enforcing the treaty provision.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{interpreted}} [...] where Moses told Aaron, [...] "This is {{what the}} Lord <b>meant</b> <b>when</b> He said: ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.'"
