40|$|International audienceSmart devices {{equipped}} with multiple network interfaces are becoming commonplace. Nevertheless, even though multiple interfaces {{can be used}} to connect to the Internet, their capabilities have not been fully utilized yet because the default TCP/IP stack supports only a single interface for communication. This situation is now changing due to the emergence of multipath protocols on different network stack layers. For example, many IP level approaches have been proposed utilizing tunneling mechanisms for hiding <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> from the transport protocols. Several working groups under IEEE and IETF are actively standardizing <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> on the link layer and transport layer. Application level approaches enable <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> capability by establishing multiple transport connections and distributing data over them. Given all these efforts, it is beneficial and timely to summarize the state-of-the-art, compare their pros and cons, and discuss about the future directions. To that end, we present a survey on <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> and make several major contributions: 1) we present a complete taxonomy pertaining to <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission,</b> including link, network, transport, application, and cross layers; 2) we survey the state-of-the-art for each layer, investigate the problems that each layer aims to address, and make comprehensive assessment of the solutions; and 3) based on the comparison, we identify open issues and pinpoint future directions for <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Quantum {{networks}} are communication networks in which adjacent nodes enjoy perfectly secure channels thanks to {{quantum key distribution}} (QKD). While QKD is renowned for perfect point-to-point security and its eavesdropping detec-tion capabilities, end-to-end security is nontrivial to achieve. More importantly, the eavesdropping detection can indeed be turned against the system itself. It is known that perfect end-to-end security can be created from point-to-point security by means of <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> (in fact, {{there is no other}} way to do this, assuming no pre-shared secrets and avoiding public-key cryptography). However, <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> requires node-disjoint paths, which in turn are to be assured by the underlying routing protocol. At this point, an active or passive adversary may intentionally eavesdrop on the QKD protocol to temporarily cut a channel and to cause key-buffers running empty and enforcing local rerouting of packets towards nodes under his control. Consequently, the <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> channels might no longer be non-intersecting, thus defeating the overall security by exploiting QKD’s eavesdropping detec-tion facilities. Alternatively, an active adversary may as well insert bogus traff c to cause local congestion, thus even sparing the effort of eavesdropping on a QKD link. In this work, we use Markov chains to model a <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission,</b> and we discuss the extent to which secure <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> is resilient against local congestions caused by an adversary. We argue that a protection against an active adversary who uses bogus traff c to f ddle with the routing, calls for additional security measures, perhaps even beyond the capabilities of QKD or <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission.</b> It turns out that robustness against passive and active adversaries can be retained as long as no bogus traff c is observed...|$|E

Applications can exploit all available interfaces {{and benefit from}} <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission.</b> Recently Multipath TCP (MPTCP) was proposed to implement <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> at the transport layer and has attracted lots of attention from academia and industry. However, MPTCP only supports TCP-based applications and its multipath routing flexibility is limited. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of orchestrating <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> from the network layer of end devices, and develop a Multipath IP (MPIP) design consisting of signaling, session and path management, multipath routing, and NAT traversal. We implement MPIP in Linux and Android kernels. Through controlled lab experiments and Internet experiments, we demonstrate that MPIP can effectively achieve multipath gains at the network layer. It not only supports the legacy TCP and UDP protocols, but also works seamlessly with MPTCP. By facilitating user-defined customized routing, MPIP can route traffic from competing applications in a coordinated fashion to maximize the aggregate user Quality-of-Experience.

40|$|International audienceSome bioacousticians {{have used}} a single {{hydrophone}} to calculate the depth/range of phonating diving animals. The standard one-hydrophone localization method uses <b>multipath</b> <b>transmissions</b> (direct path, sea surface, and seafloor reflections) of the animal phonations {{as a substitute for}} a vertical hydrophone array. The standard method requires three <b>multipath</b> <b>transmissions</b> per phonation. Bioacousticians who study foraging sperm whales usually do not have the required amount of <b>multipath</b> <b>transmissions.</b> However, they usually detect accurately (using shallow hydrophones towed by research vessels) direct path transmissions and sea surface reflections of sperm whale phonations (clicks). Sperm whales emit a few thousand clicks per foraging dive, therefore researchers have this number of direct path transmissions and this number of sea surface reflections per dive. The author describes a Bayesian method to combine the information contained in those acoustic data plus visual observations. The author's tests using synthetic data show that the accurate estimation of the depth/range of sperm whales is possible using a single hydrophone and without using any seafloor reflections.

In this paper, we quantify the efficiency of parallelism in systems that are prone to failures and exhibit power law processing durations. We focus on the context of transmitting a data unit in communication networks, where parallelism can be achieved by <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> (e. g., multipath routing). We investigate two types of transmission schemes: redundant and split transmission techniques. We find that the power-law transmission delay phenomenon still persists with <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission.</b> In particular, we show that when the transmission delays of each path are characterized by the same power law, redundant <b>multipath</b> <b>transmission</b> can only result in a constant factor performance gain, while order gains are possible when the delays are light tailed. We further compare the performance of redundant transmission and split transmission, and show that there is no clear winner. Depending on the packet size distribution properties {{and the manner in which}} splitting is performed, one scheme results in greater performance over the other. Specifically, split transmission is effective in mitigating power law delays if the absolute value of the logarithm of the packet size probability tail is regularly varying with positive index, and becomes ineffective if the above quantity is slowly varying. Based on our analysis, we develop an optimal split transmission strategy, and show that this strategy always outperforms redundant transmission. I...|$|E

The idea of Transport Virtualization (TV) progresses the capabil-ities of NV and enables the independence from a specific network transport resource. The independence is achieved by pooling multiple transport resources and selecting the best resources for exclusive or concurrent use. However, the application and selection of concurrent paths is rather complex and introduces inevitable packet re-ordering due to different stochastic delay characteristics on the used paths. Packets arriving at the desti-nation out-of-order have to be stored in a re-sequencing buffer before reassembled packets are forwarded to the application.
