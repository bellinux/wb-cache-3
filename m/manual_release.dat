5000|$|The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} irregular operation of the block apparatus by the signalman at Barnes Junction.

A <b>manual</b> <b>release</b> key could be used to circumvent this interlocking if, for example, a broken mechanical link or track circuit gave a false indication of a train on the line. The signalman for Point Pleasant, the block behind Barnes, offered the passenger train forward improperly, without waiting for the [...] "Train out of section" [...] acknowledgement from Barnes. The Barnes signalman had forgotten about the freight train and used his release key to clear the signals.|$|E

5000|$|... 7 August 1943: Lieutenant (jg) E. C. Scully {{and crew}} {{attacked}} and damaged a surfaced U-boat {{off the coast}} near Elizabeth City. On the ﬁrst and second bomb run, the bomb release malfunctioned. By the third bombing run the submarine was below the surface. The <b>manual</b> <b>release</b> was used and the U-boat was blown back to the surface. Lieutenant (jg) Scully made several straﬁng passes on the damaged submarine, but one after another of his aircraft’s machine guns froze up until only the tail gun, ﬁring single shots, remained. By this time the heavy anti-aircraft ﬁre from the U-boat had severely damaged the hull of the Mariner. Scully {{was forced to leave}} the area before leaking fuel tanks forced him down. He managed to land safely and beach the aircraft on a spit of sand before it sank.|$|E
50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during <b>manual</b> <b>release</b> and application of the brake and during emergency application of brake. The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the <b>manual</b> <b>release</b> of air pressure from tire.|$|E

Chuck reviews the day's events in his mind and recalls finding a positive pregnancy test in Josie's bag, explaining her emotions. He then accuses Bentley of being the murderer, as she was absent during every murder. When he moves closer to Bentley, however, he whispers that the actual murderer is Damien. As they draw their guns, Damien rises from his cot and threatens to detonate a boombox full of explosives {{if they do not}} get him to a doctor. Had Brody not seen him planting the explosives, Damien would have escaped. When he was forced to murder Brody and [...] "cover his tracks", Damien strategically detonated the explosive and shielded himself with the door. He also planted the bomb under the chair during his interrogation and used the distraction to hide Lewis's body. Just as Damien reveals that he came for Chuck, Bentley shoots him and retrieves the boombox. She runs to the Intersect room and uses a <b>manual</b> <b>release</b> to lock the boombox in with her and save everyone else. As the one-minute timer counts down, Chuck hacks the door's control panels to save Bentley and they evacuate. The explosion sends the Large Mart piglet flying into Chuck's arms.|$|E
