40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare some fleece and fibre {{characteristics}} of kids of Coloured mohair goat with F 1 cross-bred kids of Angora × Coloured mohair goat to reveal the effects of this cross-breeding on mohair production, clean yield, and fibre quality. This study was carried out using goats of the Coloured mohair goat breed at the Experimental Farm of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Yüzüncü Yıl University. Four Angora goats were used as male material. In 2001, greasy fleece weight, clean mohair yield, fibre diameter, fibre length, fibre elasticity, breaking strength, kemp fibre content, and <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre</b> content of kids at 12 months of age (36 F 1 cross-bred, 18 pure) were examined. Greasy fleece weight and clean mohair yield were 420 g and 74. 3 % for kids of Coloured mohair goat, and 830 g and 75. 9 % for F 1 cross-bred kids. Mean values for fibre diameter, fibre length, fibre elasticity, breaking strength, kemp fibre content, and <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre</b> content were 36. 4 μm, 7. 4 cm, 32. 4 %, 8. 2 g, 16. 2 %, and 13. 1 % for kids of Coloured mohair goat, and 30. 1 μm, 7. 8 cm, 31. 6 %, 6. 3 g, 3. 4 %, and 2. 3 % for F 1 cross-bred kids, respectively. The effect of genotype (but not sex) on greasy fleece weight, fibre diameter, breaking strength, kemp fibre content, and <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre</b> content were significant (P 0. 05). In conclusion, an overall improvement of mohair production traits was observed on F 1 kids developed by crossing Angora goat an...|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} {{methods to}} improve growth and mohair production of weaned Angora goats (mean liveweight 18 - 20 kg) {{during their first}} winter, two supplementary feeding experiments using whole-grain barley and lupins were conducted {{on a farm in}} southern New South Wales, in a region where weaner illthrift had been reported. Experiment 1 was a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial with 16 replicate goats; two feeding levels (115 or 230 g/day of whole-barley grain) × two periods of feeding (4 or 8 weeks) + Control (grazing only). Experiment 2 had five treatments × 13 replicate goats; three treatments fed 230 g/day of whole-barley grain for periods of 2 or 3 months and two treatments fed a 50 : 50 mixture of lupin and barley grain at 350 g/day for 2 or 4 months. Goats were individually fed and then all returned together for grazing. There were no effects of feeding in Experiment 1 and variations of feeding 230 g/day of barley in Experiment 2 provided no benefit. Feeding lupin/barley for 4 months increased liveweight (gain 59 g/day), mohair production, mohair fibre diameter and the incidence of <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre.</b> About 25 % of this ration was not eaten by eight goats, reducing treatment average intake to 295 g/day. By the end of spring, {{there was no difference in}} treatment liveweights. Regression constants indicated that for each 1 μm increase in mean fibre diameter, greasy fleece weight increased 35 g and for each 1 kg increase in pre-shearing liveweight, greasy fleece weight increased 26 g. The results show that Angora weaner goats can grow during winter, provided their energy and protein needs for growth are met. Improved pasture management and higher levels of supplementary feeding to weaned Angoras are indicated compared with current practices on farms in Australia...|$|E

40|$|Vasopressin {{facilitates}} the baroreflex {{control of the}} circulation. The peptide may act at several sites to augment the baroreflex. In this study we examined the effect of vasopressin on aortic baroreceptors in anaesthetized rabbits and on left ventricular mechanoreceptors in anaesthetized cats. Vasopressin (16 mu. /kg. min) did not change resting nerve discharge in single fibres from aortic baroreceptors. Vasopressin (16 mu. /kg. min) significantly enhanced the response of single aortic nerve fibre discharge to elevation in arterial pressure. The slope relating nerve activity to mean arterial pressure increased from 0. 24 +/- 0. 05 (mean +/- S. E. of mean) to 0. 50 +/- 0. 16 impulses/cardiac cycle. mmHg (P less than 0. 05) in ten aortic <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres</b> and from 0. 06 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 18 +/- 0. 04 impulses/cardiac cycle. mmHg (P less than 0. 05) in three non-medullated fibres. Vasopressin (16 mu. /kg. min) did not change resting nerve discharge in single fibres from left ventricular mechanoreceptors. Vasopressin (16 mu. /kg. min) significantly enhanced the response of single nerve fibre discharge from left ventricular mechanoreceptors in response to elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The slope relating nerve activity to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 0. 24 +/- 0. 07 to 0. 32 +/- 0. 07 impulses/cardiac cycle. mmHg (P less than 0. 05) in six <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres</b> and from 0. 10 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 15 +/- 0. 02 impulses/cardiac cycle. mmHg (P less than 0. 05) in four non-medullated fibres.

The bimodal distribution of both medullated length and diameters indicated also two coats.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of even a}} small amount of <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre,</b> in otherwise high quality mohair, may have a pronounced adverse effect on its value and end-use potential. However, there is considerable confusion about the effects, if any, of environmental variables and management upon the incidence of medullated fibres in mohair. This study examined how the incidence of medullated fibres (Med, % by number) is related to the fleece-free live weight (FFLwt) of Angora goats of different genetic origins over their lifetime, and how the relationship varies with other lifetime factors. Measurements were made over 11 shearing periods of 6 months, on a population of Angora goats representing the current range and diversity of genetic origins in Australia, including South African, Texan and interbred admixtures of these and Australian sources. Records of breed, sire, dam, date of birth, dam age, birth weight, birth parity, weaning weight, live weight, fleece growth and fleece quality were taken for castrated males (wethers) (n = 94 animals). A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) model was developed for log 10 (Med + 1), which allowed the observations of the same animal at different ages to be correlated in an unstructured manner. Med varied between 0. 1 % and 4. 3 %. The median average FFLwt during a shearing interval increased from 15 kg at 1 year old to 59 kg at 6 years old. Generally, within each shearing interval, Med increased with increasing average FFLwt. However, {{the size and shape of}} the relationship differed greatly between shearing ages. For example, at 3. 5 years of age Med increased from about 1. 1 % at an average FFLwt of 26 kg to 2. 6 % at 50 kg, whilst at 5. 0 years of age Med only changed from 1. 4 % at 32 kg to 1. 6 % at 56 kg. Goats with mixed genetic parentage showed an increase in Med at some shearings, particularly at younger ages. Variation in animal nutrition, as measured by live weight change during shearing periods, did not affect Med. The results supplement our earlier findings that mohair mean fibre diameter and clean mohair fleece weight, but not staple length, are greater in larger Angora goats. Live weight needs to be taken into account in genetic evaluation of the incidence of medullated fibres. We conclude that any advantage in handling fewer but larger Angora goats rather than more but smaller goats will come at the detriment of producing lower quality mohair, both in terms of increased Med and mean fibre diameter...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} factors affecting the reflectance attributes of Australian white mohair sourced from five different farms and {{to evaluate the}} effect of season and year on mohair grown by goats of known genetic origin in a replicated study. For the season study the mohair was harvested every three months for two years. All goats and their fleeces were weighed. Mid-side samples were tested for fibre diameter attributes, clean washing yield (CWY), staple length (SL) and for tristimulus values X, Y, Z and Y-Z. For the farm study (n = 196), linear models, relating Y, Z and Y-Z were fitted to farm of origin and other objective measurements. For the season and year study (n = 176), data were analysed by ANOVA and then by linear analysis. The variation accounted for by farm alone was: X, 22 %; Y, 24 %; Z, 12 %; Y-Z, 30 % (P < 0. 001). Once farm had been taken into account, the regression models for X, Y and Z had similar significant terms: mean fibre diameter (MFD), CWY, SL and fibre diameter CV; and correlation coefficients (057 – 0. 65). For Y-Z, in addition to farm only MFD was significant (P = 1. 8 × 10 − 9). While X, Y, Z and Y-Z {{were significantly associated with}} clean fleece weight (CFwt), CFwt was not significant in any final model. Season affected mohair Y (P = 2. 5 × 10 − 24), Z (P = 2. 3 × 10 − 20) and Y-Z (P = 6. 8 × 10 − 22). Autumn grown mohair had higher Y and Z, and summer grown mohair had lower Z than mohair grown in other seasons. This resulted in summer grown mohair having the highest Y-Z and winter grown mohair having the lowest Y-Z than mohair grown in other seasons. The differences between years in Y, Z and Y-Z were significant but not large. When Y, Z and Y-Z were modeled with season and other mohair attributes, MFD, CWY, CFwt, incidence of <b>medullated</b> <b>fibre</b> (Med) and sire were also significant terms. This model accounted for 62. 1 % of the variance. Over the range of Med (0. 3 – 4. 2 %), Y-Z increased by 11 T units. Increasing CFwt 0. 5 kg was associated with a decline in Y-Z of 7. 5 T units. The variation in Y, Z and Y-Z associated with sire effects were respectively 2. 66, 3. 77, and 1. 04 T units. In the farm and the season studies increasing MFD was associated with lower Y and Z and higher Y-Z. The extent of the differences in tristimulus values between seasons and years, were unlikely to be of commercial importance. The extent of the differences between farms, and to variations in MFD and Med were large enough to be of commercial importance. Clean mohair colour was artefactually biased by MFD...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results {{obtained}} in the search of chromosomal regions affecting fleece traits in a population of Angora goats in the Argentinean Patagonia. Six hundred thirty-four offspring from 14 parental half-sib families were used. Nine phenotypic fleece traits were recorded at 4 and 11 months of age. A genome examination using 85 informative molecular markers was conducted. A linkage analysis was performed using a regression interval analysis. Our study identified 10 genomic regions affecting the average fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of the average fibre diameter, percentage of fibres with diameters over 30 µm, greasy fleece weight, staple length, average curvature of fibres, percentage of continuous <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres</b> and percentage of kemp fibres located on five goat chromosomes (1, 2, 5, 13 and 19). These {{results show that the}} average size of the quantitative trait loci effect was 1. 6 phenotypic standard deviations for different traits and families.

40|$|The {{potential}} for adopting a genetic solution to protect sheep from blowfly strike on the breech {{was investigated in}} a flock of sheep that contained several animals expressing a trait characterised by low wool coverage over the breech and through a wide channel from the anus to the udder or scrotum. A scoring system (1, bare to 5, woolly) was developed and {{used to determine the}} heritability of the trait and its phenotypic and genetic correlations with other traits of importance in a sheep enterprise. In comparison to animals with woolly breeches, the skin in the breech of animals with a low bareness score was characterised by a low density of follicles producing short, <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres,</b> with histological evidence of immune rejection and follicular atrophy. The bareness score of progeny was influenced by the score of their respective sires suggesting a strong genetic component. The heritability of bareness score was moderate to high (h 2 = 0. 45 ± 0. 02, 0. 53 ± 0. 01 and 0. 38 ± 0. 02 at lamb, hogget and adult ages, respectively). The lactation status and age of ewes influenced their bareness score, resulting in a low repeatability (0. 42) of the trait between ages in females. Genetic correlations between bareness score and most other economically important traits were low. The weight of belly wool and the weight of skirtings was genetically related to bareness score (rg = + 0. 52 and + 0. 48 respectively), indicating that animals with barer breeches tend genetically towards lighter belly wool weights and lower weight of skirtings at wool classing. Selection and breeding for bareness score should achieve relatively rapid progress towards fixing the trait in a flock and without adverse effects on other important traits. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to other bloodlines and environments where genetic mechanisms or environmental influences may be different. N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart and P.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{genotype}} and of frequency {{and timing of}} shearing, on mohair attributes and production of modern Angora goats was studied. Goats in the southern hemisphere grazed pastures between February 2004 and 2006. There were seven shearing treatments by three genetic strains with four or eight replicates of individual goats. Treatments were: three different 6 -month shearing intervals and two of 12 -month shearing intervals with different months of shearing, a 7 -month winter shearing interval and a 3 -month shearing interval. Genetic strain was based on sire line: 1 · 0 South African; 1 · 0 Texan; and Mixed 0 · 5 South African and 0 · 5 Texan. Annual greasy mohair production was 5 · 08 kg, and average clean fleece production was 4 · 37 kg. The Angora goats produced an annual clean fleece equivalent to 0 · 122 of their mean fleece-free live weight which was equal to 0 · 34 g/kg/day. Measurements were analysed over the period of spring 2004 shearing to spring 2005 shearing, excluding the June–December shearing treatment. Increased frequency of shearing increased fleece growth and affected 13 objective and subjective attributes of mohair that were evaluated including clean washing yield, fibre diameter and fibre diameter variation, incidence of <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres,</b> staple length, fibre curvature, crimp frequency, style, staple definition, staple fibre entanglement and staple tip shape. The direction of these effects were generally favourable and for most attributes {{the magnitude of the}} response was linear and commercially important. Each additional shearing resulted in an additional 149 g of clean mohair representing 0 · 034 of the annual clean mohair production. This increase was associated with a 0 · 6 cm increase in staple length and 0 · 32 μm increase in mean fibre diameter. In conclusion, Angora goats shorn less frequently grew less mohair that was more likely to be entangled in spring. Managers of Angora goats should take note of these findings. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{repeatability}} and heritability of body weight, greasy fleece {{weight and}} mean fibre diameter, {{as well as}} various subjective fleece traits of South African Angora goats were estimated. The first of two data sets analysed, was collected through the Angora goat performance-testing scheme (AGPTS), while the second comprised data collected on the experimental flocks kept at the Jansenville Experimental Station (JEF). The following traits were assessed subjectively on a linear scale ranging from 1 to 50 at the second, third and fourth shearings, namely fullness of face covering, fullness of the neck, fullness of belly and points, style, character, evenness of fleece, softness of face and ears, pigmentation {{in the face and}} on the ears, and kemp and <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres.</b> Heritability and repeatability estimates were obtained by fitting repeatability animal models under a DFREML programme. Heritability for body weight was higher in the JEF (0. 47 ± 0. 01) than in the Angora studs (0. 35 ± 0. 05), while the same heritabilities were estimated for fleece weight (0. 22 ± 0. 04) and fibre diameter (0. 30 ± 0. 05) in both data sets. The repeatability of body weight was higher in the JEF (0. 63) than in the studs (0. 53), but it was lower for weight (0. 27 vs. 0. 41) and fibre dianleter (0. 35 vs. 0. 68) in the JEF. Heritability and repeatability estimates for all subjectively assessed traits, with the exception of face cover in the JEF and pigmentation in both data sets, were moderate, too. Due to the fact that young bucks in South Africa are sold at 14 - 16 months of age with their full third fleece, perfornance has to be done at 8 - 9 months of age at the second shearing. As fleece weight had the lowest repeatability of the three production traits, it was recommended that the fleece weight be left out of the selection index. The possible inclusion of style in the selection index needs to be investigated further. As far as the other subjectively assessed traits are concerned, it is recommended that any selection for the further improvement of these traits should be based on independent culling levels and they could not be included in the selection index...|$|R

Skin biopsies were taken at 2, 4, 6, and l 0 months of age in order to monitor four follicular parameters: i) follicular density (FD), ii) ratio of secondary to primary follicles(S/P), iii) percentage of <b>medullated</b> secondary <b>fibres</b> (PMS), and iv) percentage of active secondary follicles (PAS). As a general trend, three parameters, i. e. FD, PMS, and PAS, reached maximum values at the 2 nd month, minimum values at the 6 th month (i. e. during the winter season) and increased again until observations stopped at month 10. A slightly different trend was shown by the S/P parameter which, after having gained its maximum value at month 4, progressively decreased {{until the end of the}} observations.

40|$|In a {{range of}} animals, {{increasing}} mean fibre diameter (MFD) of fibre is associated with an increasing incidence of <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres</b> (Med). It would thus be expected that Med in mohair fleeces, from animals in a flock, would {{be related to the}} MFD of those fleeces. MFD of mohair is not the only dimensional attribute of fibres. Med in mohair is phenotypically and genetically related to the size of animals. This study examined how Med is related to dimensional properties of mohair over the lifetime of Angora goats and how the relationship varies with other lifetime factors. The relationship found is then examined to determine the extent that the relationship can be explained by variations in animal size of the goats. Measurements were made over 11 shearing periods on a population of Angora goats representing the current range and diversity of genetic origins in Australia, including South African, Texan and interbred admixtures of these and Australian sources. Records of breed, sire, dam, date of birth, dam age, birth weight, birth parity, weaning weight, live weight, fleece growth and fleece attributes were taken for castrated males (wethers). Animals’ fleece-free live weight (FFLwt, kg) were determined for each goat at shearing time by subtracting the greasy fleece weight from the live weight recorded immediately prior to shearing. The average of the FFLwt {{at the start of the}} period and the FFLwt at the end of the period was calculated. Two restricted maximum likelihood (REML) models were developed to relate Med to MFD, staple length (SL) and other lifetime factors. One model allowed FFLwt in the model and the other excluded FFLwt. With the exception of the 1. 5 years shearing, Med strongly increased with increasing MFD whether or not adjustments were made for FFLwt measurements. In particular Med increased by 2. 0 % for each 1 μm increase in MFD, with no adjustment for FFLwt measurements, and increased by 1. 5 % for each 1 μm increase in MFD, with adjustment for FFLwt measurements. Within each shearing interval increasing average FFLwt was associated with increasing incidence of Med in a similar way to that which has been previously reported without including MFD in the model. There was no evidence that SL needed to be included in the models for Med. Mohair grown by the goats of Mixed genetic background grew mohair which had a higher incidence of Med at ages 2 and 2. 5 years and the trend was apparent in other shearing periods. We can conclude that there is both a large response of Med to live weight and a large response to MFD, and that these responses are largely functionally separate. While the response to MFD is in accord with earlier work, there is an unrelated and unreported physiological mechanism that favours the production of Med in larger Angora goats. Clearly, larger Angora goats are biologically different compared with smaller animals from the same flock, in ways that are not purely related to the allometrics of size...|$|R
40|$|Selection {{responses}} and genetic parameters were estimated on wool, body and reproductive traits in a New Zealand Romney flock. In 1956 the flock {{was divided into}} 3 sub-flocks, {{each of which has}} been a closed breeding group (consisting approximately 80 ewes and 4 rams) since 1958. In one group the most open-faced yearlings were retained for breeding, in another, those with heaviest yearling fleece weights, while in the third replacements were chosen at random. Traits examined included post-shearing live weight (LW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean fleece weight (W), quality number (QN), character grade (CHG), staple length (SL), total crimp number (TCN), crimp frequency (CF), clean scoured yield (Y) and mean fibre diameter (MFD) for the ewes and ram and ewe hoggets; number of lambs born (LB) and number of lambs reared (LR) per ewe joined; date-of-birth (DOB), birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), medullameter index (MI) and face-cover grade (FC) for the ram and ewe hoggets and the standard deviation of the fibre diameter (SFD) and percent <b>medullated</b> <b>fibres</b> (PMF) for the ewe hoggets. The average inbreeding coefficient increased by approximately 0. 10 in all 3 flocks over the 21 years evaluated. Within years, sheep with the highest inbreeding coefficients generally suffered a depression in the level of performance. Heritabilities (h 2) and genetic correlations (rg) were calculated using the paternal half-sib correlation approach. Most h 2 estimates were similar to already published values. Estimates of the h 2 of ram hogget GFW were substantially smaller than corresponding ewe hogget values (0. 07 to 0. 15 cf 0. 28 to 0. 34). Face-cover grade h 2 in the face-cover flock appeared to be much reduced, suggesting a possible decline in genetic variation for this trait. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were calculated amongst all hogget traits and between ewe hogget and ewe average lifetime performance traits. Very high genetic and phenotypic correlations were found between hogget GFW and hogget W. Ewe hogget GFW tended to be positively associated with LB and LR, both genetically and phenotypically. Hogget FC was generally unrelated to other hogget and ewe traits. Ewe hogget performance in LW, GFW, W, QN, SL, TCN, Y and MFD were generally moderately to strongly related with the performance of the same ewe in corresponding traits at older ages. There was often wide variation in the three (one from each group) genetic correlation estimates for pach pair of traits. This variation was attributed to either the small number of observations available (about 80 sires per flock with 5 to 7 progeny per sire) or changing genetic variance and covariance components in the selection flocks. Realized heritability (h 2 r) estimates for FC and hogget GFW ranged between 0. 39 to 0. 54 and 0. 06 to 0. 19, respectively. The h 2 r estimates of hogget GFW were in good agreement with the paternal half-sib correlation estimates of h 2 derived from the ram hogget data but were markedly less than equivalent estimates obtained from the ewe hogget data. The h 2 r estimates of FC were generally higher than paternal half-sib estimates, but were in good agreement with estimates derived by other workers. In the face-cover flock correlated responses were generally small. Positive correlated responses of about 10 % were recorded in LB and LR over the 21 years evaluated. In the fleece weight group the components contributing toward increased GFW all showed positive correlated responses. Lamb production (LB and LR) of the fleece weight group showed an increase of about 30 %, relative to the control flock, over the 21 years studied...|$|R

A total of 28 camels were allocated at random {{on the basis of}} age to one of four groups (2, 4, 6 and older than 8 years). All groups of camels were fed a maintenance level of ration throughout the experiment. To determine hair follicle cycle and other follicle characteristics samples of skin were taken using a trephine from the right midside of animals at approximately 28 day intervals for a period of 12 months. Using a small hand clipper, 15 g of fibre sample was taken from the left midside region to determine fibre characteristics. Analysis of variance was performed using a one-way SAS package and the means and the standard deviations of means were generated with this program. Mean S/P ratio, primary and secondary and total follicle densities of all groups of camels were 6. 85 ± 0. 75, 3. 76 ± 0. 63, 22. 29 ± 3. 57 and 25. 33 ± 3. 85, respectively.
