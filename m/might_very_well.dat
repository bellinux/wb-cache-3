If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way.

On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
25|$|Before his consecration Edmund {{became known}} for {{supporting}} ecclesiastical independence from Rome, {{maintenance of the}} Magna Carta and the exclusion of foreigners from civil and ecclesiastical office. Reluctant to accept appointment as archbishop, Edmund was persuaded when {{it was pointed out}} that if he refused, the Pope <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> appoint a foreign ecclesiastic. He chose as his chancellor Richard of Wich, known to later ages as St Richard of Chichester.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E

25|$|Wilkens {{was named}} the 1971 All-Star Game MVP, but the big news of the season came when owner Sam Schulman managed to land American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year and MVP Spencer Haywood {{following}} a lengthy court battle (see Haywood v. National Basketball Assn.). The following season, the SuperSonics went on to record their first winning season at 47–35. The team, led by player-coach Wilkens and First Team forward Haywood, held a 46–27 mark on March 3, but late season injuries to starters Haywood, Dick Snyder, and Don Smith contributed to the team losing eight of its final nine games; otherwise, the 1971–72 team <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have become the franchise's first playoff team.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Austria, {{there is}} no law in effect in Germany {{requiring}} the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. Any failure {{on the part of the}} German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> prove to be a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.|$|E

25|$|The {{fate of the}} Swedish nation largely rested {{upon the}} {{outcomes}} of distant battles and the policies of distant governments—events outside the control of Swedish politicians and diplomats. Had certain battles or policies during the war been different, Sweden's ability to attain a successful policy of neutrality <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> not have succeeded. The British invasion of Norway and Germany's counter-attack on, and occupation of both Norway and Denmark, coupled {{with the fact that}} Finland was battling the Soviets, made Sweden's position extremely tenuous, in that countries {{on both sides of the}} European conflict were poised on Sweden's borders and could potentially strike at any moment. Germany had considered a Swedish invasion, and with Germany occupying both Norway and Denmark, Germany's ability to attack Sweden was a significant concern. Sweden was forced to act upon the whims and orders of a belligerent Germany.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} focal point of dissension was the Jesuit Ricci's {{contention}} that the ceremonial rites of Confucianism and ancestor veneration were primarily social and political in nature and could be practiced by converts. The Dominicans, however, charged that the practices were idolatrous, meaning that all acts of respect to the sage and one's ancestors were nothing less than the worship of demons. A Dominican carried the case to Rome where it dragged on and on, largely because no one in the Vatican knew Chinese culture sufficiently to provide the pope with a ruling. Naturally, the Jesuits appealed to the Chinese emperor, who endorsed Ricci's position. Understandably, the emperor was confused as to why missionaries were attacking missionaries in his capital and asking him to choose one side over the other, when he <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have simply ordered the expulsion of all of them.|$|E
25|$|In two of {{the general}} elections, in 1940 and 1968, they got more than 50%; however, both cases had special circumstances. In 1940 all {{established}} Swedish parties, except for the Communist Party, had a coalition government due to {{the pressures of the}} Second World War, and it can be speculated that it led to voters most likely wanting one party to be in majority to give a parliament that couldn't be hung. In 1944 the tides of the war had turned and the allied nations looked to win, giving voters more confidence in voting by preference and explaining the more normal electoral result of 46.6%. Also there <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have been some resentment among parts of the public regarding how the Communist Party was held out of the government, and in 1944 they got 10.3%. In 1968 the established Communist Party, most likely due to bad press about the communist overtaking of Czechoslovakia, got a historically very bad result of 3% of the votes, while the Social Democrats enjoyed 50.1% and their own majority in parliament.|$|E

25|$|During the {{campaign}} in Greece under Glabrio, Plutarch's account (albeit rejected by historian Wilhelm Drumann) suggests that before the Battle of Thermopylae, Cato was chosen to prevent Corinth, Patrae, and Aegium from siding with Antiochus. During this period, Cato visited Athens where, in trying to prevent the Athenians from listening to the propositions of the Seleucid king, Cato addressed them in a Latin speech, which required an interpreter to be understood by the audience. Whether this was out of necessity or merely a choice by Cato remains unclear, however, since the assertion that he <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have already known Greek at the time {{can be made from}} anecdotal evidence. For example, Plutarch said that while at Tarentum in his youth he had developed a close friendship with Nearchus, who was himself a Greek philosopher. Similarly, Aurelius Victor stated he had received instruction in Greek from Ennius while praetor in Sardinia. Nevertheless, because his speech was an affair of state, it is probable that he complied with the Roman norms of the day in using the Latin language, which compliance was considered in diplomacy as a mark of Roman dignity.|$|E

The story is a short crossover that presents characters from both Dragon Ball and One Piece. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 Mistwalker Xbox 360 exclusive RPG Blue Dragon, working with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, both of whom he had previously worked with on Chrono Trigger.

500|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} concerns precisely how, and by what means, the individual was beaten. In his 1920 essay [...] "The Lex Pompeia and the Poena Cullei", Max Radin observes that, as expiation, convicts were typically flogged until they bled (so some commentators translates the phrase to [...] "beaten with rods till he bleeds"), but that it <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be that the rods themselves were painted red. Radin also points to a third option, namely that the [...] "rods" [...] actually were some type of shrub, since it documented from other sources that whipping with some kinds of shrub {{was thought to be}} purifying in nature.|$|E

She <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{have been talking about}} witchcraft, for today it is used to describe anything that one wishes to use it for. From the simple meaning 'the craft of the Wica', it is used in connection with Black Magic, Satanism, Black Masses..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{power of}} expert systems {{came from the}} expert {{knowledge}} they contained. They {{were part of a}} new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. [...] "AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony—that intelligence <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways," [...] writes Pamela McCorduck. [...] "he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay". Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of James Campbell, the bias in the sources has led historians to see Æthelwold's {{rebellion}} as a [...] "somewhat odd episode", {{but he had a}} justifiable claim to the kingship, and he was nearly successful; if he had not been killed at the Holme, he might have united England with much less warfare than ultimately proved to be necessary. [...] "Had {{it not been for the}} chances of battle and war Æthelwold <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have been regarded as one of the greatest figures in our island's story". Lavelle argues that [...] "it is important to acknowledge the audacity of Æthelwold's actions" [...] and that he [...] "well deserves to be ranked amongst the 'Nearly Men' of early Medieval Europe". The twelfth-century Annals of St Neots called him [...] "king of the pagans".|$|E

500|$|On March29, in the {{aftermath}} of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of closure on the budget debate. Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an interim supply motion instead. The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated. That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the Social Credit Measures Act to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of [...] "experts" [...] to implement social credit.|$|E
500|$|Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were {{emergency}} boats with {{a capacity}} of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch {{in case of a}} person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the [...] "women and children first" [...] policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board {{in the vicinity of the}} launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it <b>might</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> have been able to rescue some of them.|$|E
2500|$|Hide and Seek was {{her first}} release in 2005, {{opposite}} Robert De Niro.
