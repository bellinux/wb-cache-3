5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E
5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} {{to the river and}} the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used,</b> along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the days}} when long-distance {{telephone}} calls were expensive and often very low quality, three-inch or smaller reels of triple-play or even thinner tape were used for sending long recorded messages by post, <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>using</b> 17⁄8-ips tape speed. These were known as message tapes.|$|R

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> in animal testing, {{due to their}} size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
