40|$|It {{has been}} {{the purpose of this}} {{investigation}} to determine the progressive changes that occur in the growth of the soybean plant under normal field conditions, and especially to note variation among varieties in these respects. The plant characters under observation at successive intervals after emergence included (1) the green and dry weight of the entire plant (except the roots), the seed and the pods; (2) plant height; (3) time of flowering; (4) pod elongation; (5) percentage dry matter of the plant, the seed, and the pods; (6) time of seed maturity. The soybean varieties were grown comparatively to study their growth characteristics. Periodic weight and length measurements were taken on representative random plants of each variety. Some varietal differences are indicated, and these are found to be related to earliness of variety. In all the varieties, the four plants characters, total <b>moisture-free</b> <b>weight</b> of plant, <b>moisture-free</b> <b>weight</b> of seed, length of atom, and length of pod, exhibited the normal growth pattern of most annuals, i. e., the daily increments of length and weight increased progressively during the first two-thirds of the growth period, followed by a gradual recession until their termination. On the whole, before the early varieties began to mature, all varieties except H- 5 and Illini gained in dry weight at rather similar rates. In general there was a direct relation between plant height and lateness of maturity. Although pod length varied significantly between varieties, there was no correlation between pod length and days to maturity. The rate of gain in <b>moisture-free</b> <b>weight</b> of the seed varied inversely with days to maturity. Advisor: T. A. Kiesselbach...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies {{reported}} in this thesis were: (1) to determine the uniformity of {{size and shape of}} seed which must be attained to give good planting results with planter plates which implement companies manufacture; (2) to determine {{the nature and extent of}} the variation in seedlings produced from various sizes and shapes of hybrid seed by: (a) sprout-value determinations, which in this study have been designated as the <b>moisture-free</b> <b>weight</b> of the maximum plant growth derived from the seed when grown in the essentially nonnutritive sand (quartz) medium in absolute darkness; (b) emergence of the seedlings from several depths of plantings; (c) emergence of the plants at different planting dates; (d) size of the seedling when planted at a normal depth and date; (e) obtaining yield from the various grades of seed. Three Nebraska certified double crosses were used in this study with the seeds uniformly graded for thickness and width. A study of the dropping accuracy for all grades was made to insure sufficient uniformity of size and shape within a grade to give good planting results. An electric motor was attached to a nationally known make of planter so that the planting mechanism was run steadily at a rate comparable to field planting. The kernels were dropped on a revolving belt so that each drop could be noted. Advisor: T. A. Kiesselbac...|$|E
