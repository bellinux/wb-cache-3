5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for <b>more</b> <b>patients.</b> By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E

25|$|Some in {{the medical}} {{community}} do not recognize CFS as a real condition, nor is there agreement on its prevalence. There has been much disagreement over proposed causes, diagnosis, and treatment of the illness. This uncertainty can significantly affect doctor-patient relations. A 2006 survey of GPs in southwest England found that despite more than two thirds of them accepting CFS/ME as a recognizable clinical entity, nearly half did not feel confident with making the diagnosis and/or treating the disease. Three other key factors that were significantly, positively associated with GPs' attitudes were knowing someone socially with CFS/ME, being male and seeing <b>more</b> <b>patients</b> with the condition in the last year.|$|E
25|$|Employment of {{registered}} nurses and nurse practitioners {{is expected to}} increase immensely in the next ten years through legislation and the idea of short-term savings. Much of the growth is expected to come as a result of legislation and proliferation of online schools, leading to the idea of better health care and a greater variety of solutions for health problems which have not been proven through appropriate research. Also, life expectancy is getting longer; therefore <b>more</b> <b>patients</b> are living longer and living more active lives. It is further anticipated that the need for NPs will increase because of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} placebos is a {{standard}} control component of most clinical trials, which attempt to {{make some sort of}} quantitative assessment of the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a placebo-controlled study, and its control is of the negative type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather than no treatment, is called a positive-control study, because its control is of the positive type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients respond to them, but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting <b>more</b> <b>patients,</b> by affecting responders more strongly, or both).|$|E

Cobbett accused Rush of killing <b>more</b> <b>patients</b> than he had saved. Rush ultimately sued Cobbett for libel, winning a judgment of $5,000 and $3,000 in court costs, which was only partially paid before Cobbett returned to England. Nonetheless, Rush's practice waned {{as he continued to}} advocate bloodletting and purges, much to the chagrin of his friend Thomas Jefferson. Some even blamed Rush's bleeding for hastening the death of Benjamin Franklin, as well as George Washington (although the only one of Washington's medics who opposed the bleeding was Rush's former student), and Rush insisted upon being bled himself shortly before his death (as he had during the yellow fever epidemic two decades earlier).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} world war, new {{medicines}} {{were found to be}} effective in the treatment of many of the major mental illnesses, see Chlorpromazine. Following refinement and clinic trials they were introduced {{at the end of the}} 1950s and made a massive positive impact on the hospital. At last there was an effective treatment, and as a result the containment aspect of segregated patients within wards could for most wards be relaxed. As their illnesses responded to treatment patients recovered and started to be discharged. In the early 1960s the hospital reached its maximum size (around 3.800 patients in over 100 wards) but now started for the first time to discharge <b>more</b> <b>patients</b> than it admitted. Later the main and secondary gates were unlocked during the day removing forced segregation from the outside world and in 1975 the eastern wall was removed to make way for a new general hospital to be built in the asylum grounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although <b>more</b> <b>patients</b> discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} reputation {{effects in}} a repeated game between two long-run players, {{one of whom}} is relatively patient and may be committed to a fixed strategy which punishes the opponent for increasingly long periods whenever inappropriate actions are taken.

For an arbitrary degree of patience of the less patient player a weaker result is established: the <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> player is guaranteed an average equilibrium payoff close to the static Stackelberg payoff. This latter result generalizes that of Schmidt (1993), who established the same result for the restricted class of games of conflicting interests...|$|R
