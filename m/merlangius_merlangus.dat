25|$|The Sillaginidae, {{commonly}} known as the smelt-whitings, whitings, sillaginids, sand borers and sand-smelts, are a family of benthic coastal marine fish in the order Perciformes. The smelt-whitings inhabit a wide region covering much of the Indo-Pacific, from the west coast of Africa east to Japan and south to Australia. The family comprises only five genera and 35 species, of which a number are dubious, with the last major revision of the family in 1992 unable to confirm the validity of a number of species. They are elongated, slightly compressed fish, often light brown to silver in colour, with a variety of markings and patterns on their upper bodies. The Sillaginidae are not related to a number of fishes commonly called 'whiting' in the Northern Hemisphere, including the fish originally called whiting, <b>Merlangius</b> <b>merlangus.</b>|$|E

40|$|Carbon stable {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} {{to trace}} the sources of energy supporting food chains and to estimate the contribution of different sources to a consumer's diet. However, the d 13 C signature of a consumer is not sufficient to infer source without an appropriate isotopic baseline, because {{there is no way to}} determine if differences in consumer d 13 C reflect source changes or baseline variation. Describing isotopic baselines is a considerable challenge when applying stable isotope techniques at large spatial scales and/or to interconnected food chains in open marine environments. One approach is to use filter-feeding consumers to integrate the high frequency and small-scale variation in the isotopic signature of phytoplankton and provide a surrogate baseline, but it can be difficult to sample a single consumer species at large spatial scales owing to rarity and/or discontinuous distribution. Here, we use the isotopic signature of a widely distributed filter-feeder (the queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis) in the north-eastern Atlantic to develop a model linking base d 13 C to environmental variables. Remarkably, a single variable model based on bottom temperature has good predictive power and predicts scallop d 13 C with mean error of only 0. 6 ‰ (3 %). When the model was used to predict an isotopic baseline in parts of the overall study region where scallop were not consistently sampled, the model accounted for 76 % and 79 % of the large-scale spatial variability (101 - 104 km) of the d 13 C of two fish species (dab Limanda limanda and whiting <b>Merlangus</b> <b>merlangius)</b> and 44 % of the d 13 C variability in a mixed fish community. The results show that source studies would be significantly biased if a single baseline were applied to food webs at larger scales. Further, when baseline d 13 C cannot be directly measured, a calculated baseline value can eliminate a large proportion of the unexplained variation in d 13 C at higher trophic levels...|$|R

Inadequate storage conditions are the main reason and bacteria growth that cause illness differs from species to species. The aim of this research is to observe, compare and contrast the bacterial growth on the surface of four different fish species after four days of storage duration in refrigerator. 	The research question of this investigation is: “How bacteria reproduction differs on the surface of different types of fishes; Sparus aurata, Dicentrarchus labrax, <b>Merlangius</b> <b>merlangus,</b> Engraulis encrasicolus kept in refrigerator for four days at 4 °C, indicated by counting the number of colonies reproduced on eosin methylene-blue lactose sucrose agar plate in 24 hours at 37 °C under controlled conditions (temperature, light intensity, moisture etc.) in a culture incubator?” 	The method used in this experiment is viable cell counting method. The fishes are bought freshly from the fish market and kept in the refrigerator for four days in stretch wrapped plates at 4 °C. A sample is taken from each fish surface, incubation of the sample is done on EMB agar plates for 24 hours at 37 °C. Bacterial colonies are counted after 24 hours. 	The mean results of living bacteria colony number are as follows: 50 on <b>Merlangius</b> <b>merlangus,</b> 98, 4 on Dicentrarchus labrax, 153, 6 on Engraulis encrasicolus, and 198, 6 on Sparus aurata.
