She storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus {{is about to begin}} the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).|$|E
500|$|The third main {{theory is}} that Quistclose trusts could be {{constructive}} trusts, which are created when the future trustee uses the money in an [...] "unconscionable" [...] manner. In Quistclose situations, the requirement of [...] "unconscionableness" [...] could be met by the borrower using the money for a purpose {{other than the one}} for which it was lent, allowing the lender to claim an equitable interest in it. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, the Quistclose trust principle was said by Peter Gibson J. to be that [...] "equity fastens on the conscience of the person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's [...] own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose"; this reference to [...] "conscience" [...] could make Quistclose trusts constructive in nature. However, no constructive trust could be created until the money is misused, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for an effective remedy.|$|E
500|$|St. Anger {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; the album holds {{a score of}} 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying: [...] "While it's an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion {{for the first time}} in years." [...] Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like [...] "a band jamming together in a garage for the first time, and the band just happened to be Metallica." [...] Talking about the album, Greg Kot of Blender said, [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to rehabilitate Metallica's image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage." [...] Writing for NME, Ian Watson said that: ...the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. You get the sense that, as with their emotional selves, they've taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There's no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a [...] "punishing, unflinching document of internal struggleâ€”taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield's brain. St. Anger is an immediate record." [...] Barry Walter of Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in [...] "St. Anger", stating: [...] "No wonder there's an authenticity to St. Anger's fury that none of the band's rap-metal followers can touch." [...] He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: [...] "There's no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, a {{hydrogen}} sulfide release from an oil drilling operation in Denver City, Texas, killed nine people and caused {{the state legislature}} {{to focus on the}} deadly hazards of the gas. State Representative E L Short took the lead in endorsing an investigation by the Texas Railroad Commission and urged that residents be warned [...] "by knocking on doors if necessary" [...] of the imminent danger stemming from the gas.

2500|$|The {{retreat of}} Army Group North from the {{surroundings}} of Leningrad made the commanders of Finland realise that soon it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to start {{negotiations with the}} Soviet Union. On 31 January 1944, General Field Marshal Keitel {{sent a letter to}} the Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, claiming that the retreat of Army Group North to the Panther Line constituted no danger whatsoever to Finland. Marshal Mannerheim did not share the optimism, expressing his concern that the road in Narva would be open not only to Estonia, but also to Finland. As the German condition worsened in the Narva front, President of Finland Juho Kusti Paasikivi was presented with Stalin's peace terms on 8 February. However, Finland resumed in the war. To separate Finland from Germany and make her defence hopeless, Stalin needed to conquer Estonia. Stalin hoped that a breakthrough at Narva would make Finland sign a peace treaty quickly. The perspective of an invasion to East Prussia through Estonia appealed even more to the Soviet Main Command, as it appeared bringing German resistance to a collapse. Stalin gave a short and clear order to the Leningrad Front on 14 February: ...|$|E
