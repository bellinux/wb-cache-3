30|$|According to Nestmann et al. (2009) the {{construction}} phase {{was started in}} 2004 with the drilling of the vertical shaft (using an innovative vertical drilling machine of the German industry partner Herrenknecht AG) for insertion of building material {{as well as for}} the plant’s future operation and maintenance. Subsequently the installation of the flood relief lines (leading the inflowing water during {{the construction}} phase), mining activities for widening the cavern in the area of the rock abutment as well as further preparing measures for the construction of the <b>machinery</b> <b>platform</b> were carried out.|$|E
30|$|The cave roof {{above the}} <b>machinery</b> <b>platform</b> was secured using 100  kN rock nails (0.5  nails/m 2) of 4  m length. Further nails {{in the floor}} provide {{additional}} safety for the platform and the sliding valve chamber (see Figs.  1, 7) against buoyancy. Below the barrage’s base, a stiffening “shoe plate” on three rows of short micropiles was provided, improving the underlying weathered rock’s resistance against mechanic and hydraulic impact (Mutschler and Triantafyllidis 2009). An alternative concept of stepwise investigation and strengthening by soil replacement, usage of longer piles and contact grouting, was also discussed, but not realized by the Indonesian partners.|$|E

30|$|To {{successively}} {{increase the}} tightness of the barrage-surrounding karst rock between 2009 and 2013 three grouting measures {{were carried out}} radial to the barrage and to a drilling depth of 15  m (Breiner et al. 2011). Hereby washout processes {{were meant to be}} prevented by hindering the water from flowing through the surrounding rock. The first measure was the general startup to implement the injection curtain. The second and third measures were of minor extent to locally reduce the occurring seepage water. In addition to the single layer grouting curtain a double layer drainage system was implemented to avoid an increase of the water pressure inside the hanging wall resp. cave roof above the <b>machinery</b> <b>platform.</b> Through this drainage system, the residual seepage flow is drained through boreholes dedicated to this purpose.|$|E
500|$|The noise {{made by the}} submarines, which {{compromised}} {{their ability}} to stay hidden, was another major problem with the design. In the original requisition, the RAN guidelines for the noise signature of the new submarines were vague; for example, asking that they be [...] "twice as quiet" [...] as the Oberons. Expectations and operational requirements also changed between the 1987 contract signing and when the submarines began operating in the late 1990s. The major element of the noise signature for the Oberon class was machinery noise transmitted through the hull; this was successfully avoided during construction of the Collins class by mounting <b>machinery</b> on <b>platforms</b> isolated from the hull.|$|R

40|$|Van Winkle 2 ̆ 7 s mill in Benton County, Arkansas, {{was home}} to the most {{productive}} and powerful 19 th-century mill in the Arkansas Ozarks. Today only <b>machinery</b> <b>platforms</b> and a flywheel trench remain. Archaeological investigation in Van Hollow, the locale of this mill, has taken place since 1997, yet the nature of industrial technology and {{the layout of the}} saw- and gristmill remain neglected. This study examines the industrial archaeology of this mill complex within the context of its social and cultural framework. The result illustrates that despite being on the frontier, daily operations were integrated with local, regional, and national institutions. The nature of this interpretation is apparent in terms of the labor force, where enslaved African-Americans and free whites worked side-by-side in the mill facility. Archaeology of the blacksmith shop demonstrated the partial adoption of new technologies (indicating knowledge of new methods yet the inability to fully implement them) and the layout of the shop. Excavation of the mill complex yielded a determination of the layout of that facility and a comparison of the technology there within national trends. Of particular importance was the determination that Van Winkle 2 ̆ 7 s mill could be supported by solely local demand, yet Van Winkle developed his business to serve the region. Using comparative archaeological studies, least cost models, and friction surface analyses, it became apparent that Van Winkle had little interest in the local population and manipulated the development of transportation networks and his satellite mills to distribute his products in the four-county area and to neighboring states. Finally, using census records, a context was developed for the Arkansas Ozarks to gauge the level of technological development in the Hollow. This analysis demonstrated how the regional impact of Van Winkle 2 ̆ 7 s mill was a combination of high rates of production, power, and value of products. The result is an archaeological and historical study that is anthropologically oriented in its attention to the human element of industry. It is a unified view of the industrial operations in Van Hollow and the Arkansas Ozarks with a dynamic and balanced interpretation of industrialization and development...|$|R

40|$|Distributed, wireless, microsensor {{networks}} {{promise to}} enable {{a myriad of}} applications for sensing and controlling the physical world. Rockwell Science Center has created a development environment for wireless integrated networked sensors (WINS) that includes customizable, sensor-laden networked nodes and both mobile and internet-hosted user interfaces. The WINS development system allows examination of issues relative to design, deployment and usage of microsensor networks. WINS nodes sense their environment via multiple sensors, process sensor data both autonomously and in cooperation with neighboring nodes into information, and communicate this information to users via a variety of network topologies. WINS are self-organizing in that they establish and maintain the network without user intervention. Minimizing power consumption is a primary driver in WINS development. Each node processes sensor data into information, thereby reducing power-hungry communications requirements. Power minimization also drives the design of integrated WINS hardware {{and the creation of}} new networking protocols specific to the needs of microsensor networks. Prototype WINS are being applied to area monitoring, surveillance, and physical security, to networking of personnel and physical assets over large areas, as well as to <b>machinery</b> and <b>platform</b> health and status monitoring. The WINS development environment and several of these applications are discussed here...|$|R

At center, seven large darkly-colored cylinders {{can be seen}} rising above a mesh of metallic equipment and <b>machinery.</b> Small <b>platforms</b> are visible {{at the peak of}} each cylinder. Furthermore, metallic ramps can be seen connecting the platforms of adjacent cylinders. At the top of each cylinder, a large pipe and a narrow pipe can be seen connecting to a small cylindrical tank {{at the top of the}} platform. Along three of the pipes, a series of rods can be seen running parallel to body of the cylinders. Near the base of the cylinders on the left, two large cylindrical tanks are seen connected to two of the larger cylinders. Further right, additional pipes and metallic rods are visible.

5000|$|The cost of {{the station}} was £1,000 in respect of {{building}} work plus £200 for <b>machinery.</b> Two <b>platforms</b> were provided with the station buildings on the [...] "Up" [...] side and a timber platform and waiting shelter on the [...] "Down" [...] side. The stone [...] "Up" [...] platform was very low and also very narrow. The architecture was a rural combination of brick and timber with some restrained ornamentation. The station house which adjoined the platform buildings was in a similar style to structures on the Bletchley to Bedford section of the line, being built of brick and half timber rendered with cement and decorative barge boarding around the gables. A small goods yard was served by two sidings and comprised a loading dock, weighbridge, brick hut, ground frame and loading gauge. The level crossing gate and sidings were controlled by Annett's key; when the siding was in use {{it could only be}} released by a key which was kept in a gable wing of the station building. During London, Midland and Scottish Railway days, the station, which was in a relatively rural location, was served by six services in either direction on weekdays, plus an extra service on Saturdays and three services on Sundays. When the stationmaster at Claydon was abolished, two porter signalmen ran the station on alternate shifts.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} replisome is {{a target}} {{for the development of}} new antibiotics to combat drug resistant strains. The beta(2) sliding clamp is an essential component of the replicative <b>machinery,</b> providing a <b>platform</b> for recruitment and function of other replisomal components and ensuring polymerase processivity during DNA replication and repair. A single binding region of the clamp is utilized by its binding partners, which all contain conserved binding motifs. The C-terminal Leu and Phe residues of these motifs are integral to the binding interaction. We acquired three-dimensional structural information on the binding site in beta(2) by a study of the binding of modified peptides. Development of a three-dimensional pharmacophore based on the C-terminal dipeptide of the motif enabled identification of compounds that on further development inhibited alpha-beta(2) interaction at low micromolar concentrations. We report the crystal structure of the complex containing one of these inhibitors, a biphenyl oxime, bound to beta(2), {{as a starting point for}} further inhibitor design...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{assemblies}} {{represent the}} workhorses of the cell, forming {{the basis of}} all cellular processes. Their biological roles are intimately associated with their topologies, making the structural elucidation of proteins and protein complexes a critical requirement to understanding their function. While traditional structural biology approaches have greatly contributed to our current understanding of protein structure, they are ill-suited for analyzing the conformational dynamics associated with heterogenous protein complexes and their protein-protein interactions (PPIs). As a result, {{there is a growing}} demand for the development of new structural approaches to elucidate the impact of protein dynamics on the regulation of integral biological processes required for cell homeostasis. In particular, cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has arisen in recent years as a popular hybrid structural technique for the topological determination of conformationally and compositionally heterogenous protein complexes. However, most studies utilizing cross-linking thus far have been limited to the determination of static protein structures. Here, I focus on the development and application of quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (QXL-MS) strategies to determine how conformational dynamics of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) dictate and regulate their ubiquitinating activity. Proteasomal dysregulation has been associated {{with a wide range of}} human pathologies, from diabetes and various forms of cancer to autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, the PPIs associated with CRL assemblies represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. A comprehensive understanding of E 3 ligase structure and conformational dynamics is critical for the development of pharmacological drugs that selectively inhibit or upregulate their function. However, such heterogenous assemblies are notoriously difficult to study using traditional structural biology techniques. While this thesis focuses on the application of quantitative XL-MS strategies to study cullin-RING ligase <b>machinery,</b> these <b>platforms</b> represent versatile methodologies that can be universally employed for structural studies on a wide range of protein systems...|$|R
40|$|Flotillins are universally conserved {{proteins}} that {{are present in}} all kingdoms of life. Recently it was demonstrated that the B. subtilis flotillin YuaG (FloT) has a direct influence on membrane domain formation by orchestrating lipid domains. Thereby it allocates a proper environment for diverse cellular <b>machineries.</b> YuaG creates <b>platforms</b> for signal transduction, processes crucial for biofilm formation, sporulation, competence, secretion, and others. Even though, flotillins are an emerging topic {{of research in the}} field of microbiology {{little is known about the}} molecular architecture of prokaryotic flotillins. All flotillins share common structural elements and are tethered to the membrane N'- terminally, followed by a so called PHB domain and a flotillin domain. We show here that prokaryotic flotillins are, similarly to eukaryotic flotillins, tethered to the membrane via a hairpin loop. Further it is demonstrated by sedimentation assays that B. subtilis flotillins do not bind to the membrane via their PHB domain contrary to eukaryotic flotillins. Size exclusion chromatography experiments, blue native PAGE and cross linking experiments revealed that B. subtilis YuaG can oligomerize into large clusters via the PHB domain. This illustrates an important difference in the setup of prokaryotic flotillins compared to the organization of eukaryotic flotillins...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Success in {{manufacturing}} industries often {{depends on the}} ability of a firm to apply product platforms. In speeding up product development, platforms often enable companies to benefit from scale effects by reusing existing components in the development of new products. In the delivery of complex products and system (CoPS), however, platforms are frequently modified since components have to be changed within their life cycle to meet additional customer-specific engineering demands and evolving innovations in technology. In this article it will be illustrated that intangible design elements can be used as platforms in firms that deliver CoPS. Design/methodology/approach - Through extensive fieldwork at a leading supplier of science-based lithography <b>machinery,</b> a modified <b>platform</b> concept was developed and tested that is labelled as the function-technology (FT) platform. The longitudinal data, collected on site, demonstrate positive effects of applying function-technology platforms. Findings - The results show that an important explanation for firm’s success in delivering lithography machinery with attractive performance is their ability to deliver variants that are specific in terms of physical modules, but common in terms of functions and technologies. Based on the results, {{it can be argued that}} establishing an FT platform will allow the efficient creation of variants within a family of CoPS. Originality/value - The findings add considerable insight to the existing literature on operations management by explaining how intangible design elements, instigated during development, can be reused in the delivery of CoPS. Moreover, it enables development managers to more easily structure and reuse complex development tasks...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{approximately}} 3 billion m 3 of wood is harvested {{and removed}} from forests annually. Forest plantations {{play an important}} role in forest harvesting providing 46 % of the total industrial roundwood produced in the world, while they account for only 7 % of the world’s forested area. Modern harvesting systems are mechanised for productivity, costs, and safety reasons. Due to the advances and availability of both computing and sensor technologies, mechanised <b>machinery</b> is a <b>platform</b> for integration of these technologies with electronic control systems capable of monitoring machine functions, estimating measurements, and recording data. One of the most popular mechanized harvesting systems is Cut-To-Length (CTL). The CTL system typically consists of two types of machines, a harvester, which fells and processes the trees into logs in the stand, and a forwarder that extracts the logs. CTL machines were developed in Scandinavia and are now used worldwide. They are the preferred technology for harvesting fast growing forest plantations in some South American countries such as Uruguay. Harvesters are equipped with a system called StanForD that provides a mechanism to automatically record data from forest harvesters in a series of file formats. When harvesters are equipped with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, these data include a locational reference and a time stamp. GNSS-enabled data provide site-specific information that is a valuable input for both stand level forest management and harvesting operation assessment. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the usefulness of GNSS-enabled StanForD files as a tool for evaluating variables affecting harvesting operations and the forest management process. To achieve the objective two independent studies were carried out. Chapter 2 explores opportunities to manage harvesting operations. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the geospatial and time information contained in StanForD files to model harvester productivity. A harvester dataset obtained from Uruguay comprised over 63, 000 cycles of felled and processed stems (stm files) and 1440 shift hours (drf files). With two thirds of this cycle time data, a mixed effects model was fitted to evaluate harvester productivity as a function of stem diameter at breast height (DBH), species, shift (day/night), slope, and operator. A slope surface derived from a digital terrain model was overlaid with GNSS stem records. The reserved third of the data was used to validate the model. DBH was the most influential variable in harvester productivity, showing a positive correlation and a R 2 value of 0. 73 in the validation model. Operator and species also had significant effects. There was no significant slope effect, whereby the study area only had flat and mildly sloping terrain. Shift did not have a significant effect, indicating there was no drop in night shift productivity. The model developed constitutes the first published harvester productivity model in South America based on data automatically collected by harvesters. Chapter 3 and 4 explore opportunities to provide feedback to improve the forest management process using the site-specific harvester data. Stand productivity of fast-growing forest plantation varies across short distances depending on site and forest characteristics. As plantation forest silviculture is typically resource intensive in establishment, forest management would benefit from a site-specific approach. A tool to characterize such stand productivity variations are yield maps and a cost effective source of data is automatically collected by harvesters. To create such maps we need to understand the effect of geospatial accuracy of tree location recorded by the harvester. The objective of Chapter 3 is to improve our understanding of spatial resolution for studying variations in volume and stocking across forested stands, and establish guidance for actual spatial resolution that would allow the development of fit-for-purpose forest yield maps from harvester data. This study investigated data sets from seven stands: two had very accurate tree location, and five were harvester data files that have inaccuracy associated with both the GNSS recording under forest canopy and the physical dislocation of the GNSS relative to the harvested tree location. The GNSS unit is on the cabin of the machine, but the tree is felled using a boom and could be up to 12 meters from the cabin. A spatial resolution for studying variations in stand productivity and stocking across stands was established to allow the development of forest yield maps from harvester data. By assessing the variability across a range of cell sizes, it was concluded that a cell size between 40 and 60 m is suitable to use as a reference for calculating volume per hectare and stocking. Based on the outputs of Chapter 3, the objective of Chapter 4 was to develop models to map stand productivity from GNSS enabled harvester data. This chapter first explores several models using the same two stands with accurate tree location used in Chapter 3. It assesses their accuracy, then applies the models to the harvester data stands, and finally compares the results of the models to determine the most suitable models. The assessment of the models includes the comparison of productivity maps created from inventory plots. Chapter 5 is a synthesis of the findings, contributions, limitations of the studies, and views on future research needs resulting from this work.
