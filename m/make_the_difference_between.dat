5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the lack of sales, and for the poor {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, one of the worst depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a family eating or starving {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars before the crash often spent their souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E

Organizations, governments, and institutions do not form to fail; they form to succeed and have an impact. What is it about some organizations that {{that allow them to}} sustain a high level of sustainability while others flounder? Take for example banking in the United States, 255 banks have failed nation-wide since 2008. (Wall Street Journal, 2010) In the same time, 251 banks have started up and by all accounts are thriving.

25|$|There {{are also}} {{striking}} regional variations in food security. Although food insecurity {{can be difficult}} to measure, 45% of elementary and secondary students in Maine qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch; by some measures Maine has been declared the most food-insecure of the New England states. Transportation challenges and distance are common barriers to families in rural areas who seek food assistance. Social stigma is another important consideration, and for children, sensitively administering in-school programs can <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> success and failure.

2500|$|While {{the primary}} focus of {{heterosexual}} sex films are the women in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance, there is a definite focus on the male performers who are able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies. Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess, namely their ability to do three things: achieve an erection while on a busy and sometimes pressuring film set, maintain that erection while performing on camera, and then ejaculate on cue. In the past an actor's inability to maintain an erection or being subject to premature ejaculation could <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a film turning a profit or a loss. However this problem has been solved by the use of Viagra. If an actor loses his erection, filming is forced to stop for about 45 minutes whilst the drug takes effect. Using Viagra can make the actor's face noticeably flushed, give him a headache, and make it difficult to ejaculate. According to director John Stagliano, using Viagra means [...] "You also lose a dimension." [...] "The guy's fucking without being aroused." ...|$|E
