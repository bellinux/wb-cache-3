Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated {{that it did not}} help Lo to stand out from other pop artists. Svenska Dagbladets Sara-Märta Höglund compared the EP to Katy Perry's Prism (2013) and stated that, [...] "though Lo knows how to make a hit, I have wished she had ventured out on a more stripped-down production and dropped the tiresome drug romanticism".|$|E

He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated and <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to protect stuff that’s yours, and puts you {{in the process of}} securing what’s yours."

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to watch it".

[...] Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "catchy [...] <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to grab some glow sticks and hit the clubs" [...] and added that the Femme Fatale era [...] "already shows an undeniably more confident Spears." [...] Mike Collett-White of Reuters deemed it as a dance anthem. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that the song is unquestionably a Dr. Luke production, but [...] "somehow it's Brit that manages to come out on top."

500|$|A few modern video gaming {{websites}} reviewed Ninja GaidenIII {{upon its}} release to the Virtual Console in 2008. Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings, {{saying that the}} game [...] "passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast". He added that while the presentation was great, he pointed out flaws in the [...] "silly" [...] plot, the inconsistently laid-out level designs, and frustrating difficulty {{in addition to the}} five-continue limit. He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one. IGN's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu's ability to scale and climb on top of walls, his ability to hang overhead, good storyline, and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power-up and the Vacuum Wave. His chief criticism was the game's difficulty, saying that it's not the [...] "rewarding kind of difficult" [...] but instead [...] "the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to throw your controller at the TV screen and just go read a book". As with the Nintendo Life review, Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre, including [...] "weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones".|$|E

The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character sound bites are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to cry or pull your hair out". On {{the subject of the}} voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing really that cute, clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|E
