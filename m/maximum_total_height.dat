50|$|Chamaelirium luteum has a basal rosette {{of around}} six 8-15 cm leaves, {{from which a}} single spike-like raceme {{inflorescence}} (1-1.5 cm diameter, 8-30 cm length) emerges. The plants are generally dioecious, with male-biased gender ratios in a given population. This is due to higher mortality of female plants, and the tendency of female plants to flower less frequently. Female stalks tend to be taller, giving a <b>total</b> <b>maximum</b> plant <b>height</b> of about 1.2 m, but also tend to have about ten times fewer flowers.|$|R
40|$|The tadpoles of Yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata) can {{be easily}} {{recognized}} from other Italian anuran species, except those of B. pachypus (though the two congeneric species are allopatric). In this paper we report morphometric data on B. variegata tadpoles from a Lombard population living near a torrent at 450 m a. s. l. On a sample of 264 tadpoles (stages 19 - 44, according to Gosner, 1960) we measured the following five variables: snout-vent length, tail length, <b>maximum</b> tail <b>height,</b> <b>total</b> length and weight. We found a slight allometric relationship between snout-vent length and tail length, while, as expectes,. the weight is nearly proportional to the cube of linear measures. According to literature data, our results point to highly constant proportions during the development phases up to prometamorphic stages. The ratio between snout-vent length and tail length was about 0. 75 during the whole growing phase, while from stage 42 the proportion increases as the resorption of the tail starts...|$|R

30|$|The zoning {{ordinance}} for {{the suburban}} dwelling district set a lower limit {{for the open}} space of a parcel as 70 %, limiting excessive coverage by building structures and impervious covers. Due to that regulation, the highest land surface temperature of this planning zone was recorded as 29  °C and the lowest was 19  °C. The RF selected 14 variables including NDVI, percent developed imperviousness, percent tree cover, average building <b>heights,</b> <b>total</b> number of population have education less than 9 th grade, total number of population age under 18, total number of population age over 65, <b>maximum</b> building <b>height,</b> <b>total</b> number of rental unit, median house value, total number of non-white population, median household income, total number of household unit, and population density. With total 14 variables, the RF explains 79.64 % of total variance in the dataset and the RMSE was 0.946  °C with the rRMSE was 9.46 % (Fig.  7). The PCA selected three principal components explaining the demographic characteristics, urban physical characteristics, and household level economic characteristics with 51.3 % of total variance explained by the method. The total building footprint variable and {{the total number of}} female population variable were selected for PCA method mot not identified by the RF method as important variables (Table  3).|$|R

Inqilab- 91, Daman- 98, Dera- 98 and Punjab- 96 at Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan (NWFP), Pakistan during 2000 ~ 2001. The experiment was laid out in split plot design having four replications using a net plot size of 2 m× 5 m. Nitrogen doses used were 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg/ha. The results showed that different nitrogen levels had significant effects on plant <b>height,</b> <b>total</b> number of plants/m 2, number of grains/spike, number of spike/m 2, spike weight, biological yield, grain yield and grain protein content. <b>Maximum</b> plant <b>height,</b> <b>total</b> number of plants/m 2, number of spikes/m 2, spike weight, biological yield and grain protein content were observed at 200 kg N/ha. Among wheat varieties Daman- 98 had maximum plant height, spike weight, grains/spike, 1000 -grain weight, biological yield and grain yield. Inqilab- 91 had heavier grains and the most grain protein content, while Dera- 98 had the maximum plant population and spikes/m 2. Grain yield and biological yield were statistically similar at doses of 150 kg N/ha and 200 kg N/ha. However, dose of 200 kg N/ha, compared to dose of 150 Kg N/ha, significantly increased the protein content...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 20002 This study {{looked at}} early height growth of planted white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss around the Fairbanks area. The effort focused on two Levels-of-Growing-Stock (LOGS) {{experimental}} plantations {{located in the}} Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest that incorporated an espacement study. Annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> was also measured on 16 operational plantations and then compared to LOGS plantations. Average annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> at Site 2 of the LOGS plantations was significantly greater than at Site 1. A significant difference in height growth between these sites was attributed to differences in aspect. Results showed significant annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> differences among the espacement plots within the LOGS plantation. The narrowest spacing 1. 2 X 1. 2 m and widest spacing 3. 7 X 3. 7 showed a lower annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> while spacings 1. 8 X 1. 8 m, 2. 4 X 2. 4 m, and 3. 0 X 3. 0 m showed a greater annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> at age ten. The range of annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> found at the LOGS sites was not significantly different than the range of annual <b>total</b> <b>height</b> found at the 16 operational plantations. Additionally, path {{analysis was used to}} quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple environmental variables (i. e., percent slope, slope position, competition, aspect, and soil moisture) on growth rate at the operational plantations. It was found that slope position, percent slope, and competition had significant direct effects on growth rate. These results provide insight for resource managers when predicting the height growth of planted white spruce...|$|R

This research was conducted in Experimental Forest Station of Gorgan University that {{is located in a}} temperate forest of Golestan province in the north of Iran. In this research, two parcels at high altitudes (800 - 900 m) and two parcels at lower altitudes (550 - 650 m) with east and west aspects were selected as well. After selecting of plus trees in every parcels, the characteristics including tree <b>total</b> <b>height,</b> stem height without branch, crown length and radius, trees diameter, annual mean growth of diameter and bark thickness were measured. Greater amounts of annual diameter growth were detected in east direction which had a significant difference (P< 0. 05) with west direction. Results are indicating that the tree <b>total</b> <b>height,</b> stem height without branch, crown length to <b>total</b> <b>height</b> ratio and annual growth of diameter had significant differences (P< 0. 01) between two altitude classes and the most <b>total</b> <b>height</b> and stem height without branch were observed in high altitude class. Crown length to <b>total</b> <b>height</b> ratio and also annual growth of diameter were decreased with increasing of altitude. Analysis of variance showed that interaction effects had no significant differences for all of studied characteristics. In total, our study supports that west slopes and upper altitudes have more appropriate conditions for growth of beech plus trees...|$|R
30|$|The <b>total</b> <b>height</b> H, {{of a given}} tree, was numerically {{estimated}} from Equation [1] by {{searching for}} the value of H that gave a taper curve that minimised the sum of squared residuals given the observed diameters and heights above ground of the discs from the tree. This was achieved by use of a SAS macro that had been programmed to search across a range of <b>total</b> <b>height</b> values (0.5 m above the height above ground of the topmost disc to a distance of 60 m beyond this starting point), at intervals of 0.01 m, and return the value of H corresponding to the minimised sum of squared residuals. An evaluation of this approach showed that the <b>total</b> <b>height</b> estimates were generally reasonable. However, it was possible that <b>total</b> <b>heights</b> of a few of the trees were overestimated as their height estimates were beyond the expected maximum values for radiata pine trees of a given age. Graphical plots of the taper equations of best fit (not shown), overlain on the disc diameter and height data from select trees across the range of tree dbh in the data, also showed that the <b>total</b> <b>heights</b> of the larger diameter trees were slightly overestimated, especially those trees where diameter at breast height was greater than 50 cm the topmost disc was sampled at only 10 m above the ground.|$|R
