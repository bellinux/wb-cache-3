5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, dydrogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. noretynodrel) that do not.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{previously}} available alone in 5mg tablets under {{the brand name}} Norlutin in the U.S., but this formulation has since been discontinued in this country. However, NETA remains available alone in 5mg tablets under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate in the U.S. It {{is one of the}} only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the U.S. The others include progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as the atypical agent danazol.|$|E

50|$|CPA is a pregnane steroid and an acetylated {{derivative}} of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is structurally related to other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
50|$|MGA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6 position, a methylene group at the C16 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of MGA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and osaterone acetate.

50|$|Secondary adrenocortical {{insufficiency}} involves only {{a deficiency}} of glucocorticoid secretion. Destructive lesions (e.g. neoplasia, inflammation) in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus and chronic administration of exogenous glucocorticoids or <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> (cats) {{are the most}} common causes.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone {{derivatives}} such as cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> CMA is a weak glucocorticoid, {{and has the}} potential to cause adrenal insufficiency upon abrupt discontinuation of the drug at sufficient dosages.|$|E
50|$|Medrogestone, {{also known}} as 6,17α-dimethyl-6-dehydroprogesterone or as 6,17α-dimethyl-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is structurally related to the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Medrogestone itself is not a 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative and is instead a derivative of 17α-methylprogesterone. This is because it features a methyl group at the C17α position instead of a hydroxy or acetoxy group. In addition to its C17α methyl group, medrogestone possesses a methyl group at the C6 position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions. The only structural difference between medrogestone and <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> is {{the replacement of the}} C17α acetoxy group with a methyl group.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the hormones}} {{with which it}} competes, {{flutamide}} is not a steroid; rather, it is a substituted anilide. Hence, it is described as nonsteroidal in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Megestrol (INN, BAN) is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone {{group which}} was never marketed {{and is not}} currently used clinically. Its acylated derivative <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> is also a progestogen, which, in contrast to megestrol itself, has been extensively used as a pharmaceutical drug.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as antiandrogens. These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> nomegestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone.|$|E
50|$|Weight {{loss and}} loss of {{appetite}} ("cachexia") is an effect of some diseases, and {{a side effect of}} some drugs. Progestagens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> (MA) are approved as a treatment in Europe, along with corticosteroids for short-term use. Direct ghrelin administration increases appetite as well.|$|E
50|$|Butagest, {{also known}} as buterol, as well as 3β-hydroxy-6-methyl-17α-hydroxypregna-4,6-dien-20-one 3β-butanoate 17α-acetate or as 6-methyl-17α-hydroxy-δ6-progesterone 3β-butanoate 17α-acetate, is a steroidal {{progestin}} that was developed in Russia for potential clinical use but was never marketed. It is a modification of <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate</b> in which the C3 ketone has been replaced with a C3β butanoyloxy moiety.|$|E
50|$|NOMAC is a norpregnane steroid and a {{derivative}} of progesterone {{belonging to the}} 19-norprogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone groups.

50|$|Such {{conditions}} may {{be treated with}} drugs with antiestrogen actions, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and clomifene, estrogen receptor antagonists such as fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and exemestane, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues such as leuprolide and cetrorelix, and/or other antigonadotropins such as danazol, gestrinone, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|E

50|$|Like other steroidal progestins with {{antiandrogen}} properties such as cyproterone acetate, <b>megestrol</b> <b>acetate,</b> and spironolactone, {{but unlike}} nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide and bicalutamide, CMA {{is not a}} silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) but rather a weak partial agonist of the AR with the capacity to activate the receptor {{in the absence of}} more efficacious agonists such as testosterone.|$|E
50|$|OHPC, {{also known}} as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or as 17α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione C17α hexanoate, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone.
