5|$|As to the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> for {{an offence}} under section 3(a), see R v Buckingham, 63 Cr App R 159, CA.|$|E
5|$|As well as finding {{objective}} {{evidence of a}} crime being committed, investigations {{can also be used}} to prove the intent (known by the legal term <b>mens</b> <b>rea).</b> For example, the Internet history of convicted killer Neil Entwistle included references to a site discussing How to kill people.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{separate}} <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> element {{from the}} assault or battery, {{making this a}} crime of constructive liability. This has been defended by John Gardner, a proponent of the moral threshold theory. However, this is opposed by Simester and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{statutes}} {{differ in}} their jurisdictional elements, the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> that they require (for example, {{a quid pro quo}} or a nexus), the species of official actions that are cognizable, whether or not non-public official defendants can be prosecuted, and in the authorized sentence. The statutes most often used to prosecute public corruption are the Hobbs Act, Travel Act, RICO, the program bribery statute, and mail and wire fraud statutes.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
25|$|In R. v. DeSousa, the Court had {{rejected}} {{the claim that}} there must be symmetry between all actus reus and <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> elements.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of offenses require a further element of intent beyond the basic intent (where the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{is no more than}} the {{intentional}} or reckless commission of the actus reus). This additional element is termed specific intent.|$|E
25|$|A related {{concept is}} that under American jurisprudence, {{different}} standards of proof are required in {{civil and criminal}} proceedings. Normally, to be convicted of a crime, the defendant {{must have had a}} specific <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> or guilty mental state. For criminal violations of the income tax law, this generally means that the prohibited conduct (whether failure to file, failure to pay, or engaging in some affirmative act to evade the tax), must have been accompanied by an intentional violation of a legal duty of which the defendant was aware. By contrast, to establish civil liability to pay the tax, no <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{on the part of the}} defendant is required to be proven.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Carll (1881), the Court {{defined the}} <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{required}} under the counterfeiting statute. In Ex parte Carll (1883), the Court {{held that the}} offense of counterfeiting was stated where {{the name of the}} original payee had been erased and replaced.|$|E
25|$|Loan {{words and}} phrases from other languages: In English, this {{includes}} terms derived from French (estoppel, laches, and voir dire) and Latin (certiorari, habeas corpus, prima facie, inter alia, <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> sub judice) and are not italicised as English legal language, as would be foreign words in mainstream English writing.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{based on}} fault: Civil {{responsibility}} was {{grounded in the}} idea of fault. Article 1067 establishes that no punishable illicit act exists where there has been no harm caused, or exterior action that could cause harm, and without the ability to impute <b>Mens</b> <b>rea,</b> fault or negligence to the actor.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
25|$|He {{is famous}} now for his {{writings}} on law, particularly De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae ("On the Laws and Customs of England") and his ideas on <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> or criminal intent. According to Bracton, {{it was only}} through the examination {{of a combination of}} action and intention that the commission of a criminal act could be established.|$|E
25|$|A person {{subject to}} {{supervision}} who contravenes or fails {{to comply with}} any order or restriction imposed on him is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for not {{less than one year}} and not more than three years. As the restrictions are absolute, a person need not possess any <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> (fault element) to have committed an offence.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajišnik {{was found}} guilty of {{multiple}} instances of crimes against humanity, but while the ICTY judges found that there was evidence that crimes committed in Bosnia constituted the criminal act of genocide (actus reus), they did not establish that the accused possessed genocidal intent, or was part of a criminal enterprise that had such an intent (<b>mens</b> <b>rea).</b>|$|E
25|$|After World WarII, the {{parameters}} of command responsibility were thus increased, imposing liability on commanders for their failure to prevent the commission of crimes by their subordinates. These cases – the latter two part of the Nürnberg tribunals – discussed explicitly the requisite standard of <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> and were unanimous in finding that a lesser level of knowledge than actual knowledge may be sufficient.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, the intoxication {{defense is}} a defense {{by which a}} defendant may claim diminished responsibility {{on the basis of}} substance intoxication. Where a crime requires a certain mental state (<b>mens</b> <b>rea)</b> to break the law, those under the influence of an intoxicating substance may be considered to have reduced liability for their actions. With regard to punishment, intoxication may be a mitigating factor that decreases a prison or jail sentence. Numerous factors affect the applicability of the defense.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{affirmed that}} the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> or mental element for {{liability}} was the intentional {{publication of the}} allegedly contemptuous statement. The Court then focused on the actus reus of the offence, and considered the legal principles for identifying the suitable test for liability for scandalizing contempt. In particular, the Court detailed {{the contents of the}} real risk test, the clear and present danger test, and the inherent tendency test. It held that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing contempt in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|E
25|$|Legal systems {{more or less}} try {{to uphold}} the notions of {{fairness}} and justice. If a state is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according {{to the idea that}} those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of strict liability, in which the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.|$|E
25|$|If {{a company}} {{has gone into}} an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by summary procedure for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named wrongful trading, so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. Intentional wrongdoing and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> is unnecessary in the interest of preventing unjust enrichment of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{element is}} that of [...] "malice", which means either {{intention}} or recklessness. Cunningham recklessness is applied. However, {{for the purposes of}} recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient [...] it does not require foresight of serious harm. This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> should match the actus reus of an offence.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{requirement}} for battery {{is similar to}} assault. It is the intention to apply unlawful force to another, or be reckless as to whether such force is applied. It employs Cunningham recklessness [...] that the defendant must have foreseen {{the risk of the}} infliction of unlawful force upon V. In theory, at least, combining the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> of battery with the actus reus of assault, or vice versa, is not a crime. The Majewski test is applied to cases of voluntary intoxication, as battery is also a crime of [...] "basic intent" [...] in this scenario.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> {{any form of}} recklessness, {{including}} virtual certainty, is insufficient for an offence under Section 44, {{in part due to}} the existence of Section 45 and 46 which aid its interpretation. Offences under Sections 45 and 46 are only committed if the defendant believes that both the crime will be committed, and that the act will encourage or assist the offender: that they might do so is not enough. However, it is also possible to commit these offences if the defendant commits an act capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of a crime, intending or believing that the principal offender would carry out the [...] "act", where that may not in itself constitute a crime. However, it is necessary that the defendant intend or be reckless to any required circumstances or consequences [...] for example, that death was a result. Additionally, the prosecution must show that the defendant believed that (or was reckless to) whether the act would be done with the required <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> or that the defendant himself has the required <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> for the offence. These amount to very complex provisions.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> of all {{offences}} in the Act {{is direct}} or oblique intention, or subjective recklessness {{as defined by}} the House of Lords in R v. G (2003). Bingham L.J. stated that a person acts [...] "recklessly" [...] with respect to ...|$|E
500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (<b>mens</b> <b>rea)</b> for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E
500|$|The case of R v Brown {{established}} a further requirement: hostility. This {{is not easily}} called an actus reus nor <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> requirement. It was not clear what role it played in that case, but could apply to other cases {{as a way of}} clarifying the [...] "everyday behaviour" [...] guidance. It has been strongly criticised by Lord Goff and other judicial and academic writers. It could apply to future cases where the bodily harm was unintended or unforeseen.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{insanity}} in English law dates from 1324, when the Statute de Praerogativa Regis allowed the King {{to take the}} lands of idiots and lunatics. The early law used various words, including [...] "idiot", [...] "fool" [...] and [...] "sot" [...] to refer {{to those who had}} been insane since birth, and [...] "lunatic" [...] for those who had later become insane, or were insane with some lucid intervals. In the criminal law, insanity was used as a defence in a roughly identical way from this point until the late 16th century; if an insane person commits a crime, he was not punished {{in the same way that}} a sane felon who committed the same crime would be. This was for several reasons; firstly, the cruel punishment usually meted out to felons to set an example would not have the same effect on the insane. Secondly, as felonies required a <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> an insane person could not be guilty because they did not have the capacity to hold a <b>mens</b> <b>rea.</b> Thirdly, the phrase furiosus solo fitrere punitur was used; [...] "a lunatic was punished by his madness alone".|$|E
500|$|The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> {{requirement}} {{is that the}} defendant must have intend to, or recklessly, cause the victim to fear the possibility of immediate unlawful violence. There is no authority that suggests that [...] "intend" [...] or [...] "recklessly" [...] ought to mean something from their normal meanings. Cunningham recklessness [...] that the defendant himself foresaw the risk of harm [...] is applied. Assault is a crime of [...] "basic intent" [...] {{for the purposes of}} the Majewski test concerning voluntary intoxication.|$|E
500|$|Murder {{has never}} been statutorily defined, despite being {{recognised}} as either the most serious crime, or certainly among them. The actus reus (prohibited act) of murder, unlawfully causing the death of another person, fits the general provisions for homicide. The <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> (mental element) of murder was long held to be [...] "malice aforethought", which took on a meaning only of the required mental state for murder, since malice aforethought required neither malice (compassionate killing is still murder) nor aforethought (no premeditation is required). It is this mental component that marks murder out from manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|The law in {{this area}} is often criticised because it sets a legal {{standard}} for insanity, not a medical one. In R v Quick and Paddison [...] QB 910, for example, the courts decided that an assault committed when the defendant was suffering from hypoglycemia due to the taking of insulin was not insane in nature, while in R v Hennsey [...] 1 WLR 287 it was held that a crime committed while the defendant was suffering from hyperglycemia did constitute insanity. As a result, the existing law allows some diabetics to be acquitted while others are declared insane, something one academic describes as [...] "absurd". In R v Sullivan, a man was charged with grievous bodily harm under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 after assaulting his friend during an epileptic seizure. The House of Lords ruled that Sullivan was indeed insane, and that [...] "it does not lie within the power of the courts to alter [...] ". Some critics have professed [...] "unease" [...] at the powers of the courts to confine people found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity in mental hospitals, arguing that discussion of mental health should be limited to the <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> of the crime; if the mental condition of the defendant voided the offence's <b>mens</b> <b>rea,</b> he should be acquitted.|$|E
500|$|Conspiracy {{is both a}} {{statutory}} {{and common}} law offence. In its statutory form, under the Criminal Law Act 1977, it consists of any agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence. Common law conspiracy, on the other hand, covers [...] "conspiracy to defraud" [...] and [...] "conspiracy to corrupt public morals", although the latter has no substantive case law and is not seen as an offence that individuals {{are likely to be}} prosecuted for. All three inchoate offences require a <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> of intent, and upon conviction, the defendant is sentenced as if they had succeeded in committing the attempted, incited or conspired crime in question.|$|E
500|$|New Jersey's {{criminal}} code prohibits voluntary intoxication from being used directly {{as a defense}} to a crime, though if a crime requires that the conduct was committed intentionally, intoxication may prevent the person from having the necessary <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> to be guilty. For example, a person accused of killing a person during a fight while drunk may not be guilty of murder because New Jersey law requires that the actor purposely or knowingly [...] "causes death or serious bodily injury resulting in death." [...] In such a case, an accused killer could be found guilty of manslaughter, which only requires reckless conduct, including acts committed while intoxicated.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{are governed}} by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which states that [...] "if, with intent to commit an offence to which , a person does an act {{which is more than}} merely preparatory to the {{commission}} of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence". A required element is intent, or <b>mens</b> <b>rea.</b> In R v Pearman, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act {{is the same as the}} definition in the common law. The common law gives intention [...] "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition. Conditional intent [...] where somebody has an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances [...] has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979), the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal [...] "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully". This was a procedural solution to a previous apparent contradiction, but the suggested drafting may not demonstrate sufficient proximity between the defendant's actions and what he was planning to steal. A <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> requirement is added to the attempt of crimes of strict liability (where there is no intent or merely objective recklessness), although the ruling in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1992) makes this less certain.|$|E
500|$|Offences {{against the}} person include minor forms of battery (any {{unlawful}} touching of another person); its complimentary offence, assault (causing the apprehension of a battery, even when one {{has not yet}} occurred); and various more serious offences {{which are based on}} assault and battery (together called [...] "common assault"). This includes assault occasioning actual bodily harm, where the victim suffers injuries such as bruising or skin abrasions (the converse being an injury that is [...] "transient and trifling"); wounding (a piercing of all layers of the skin); and causing grievous bodily harm (injuries more serious than in actual bodily harm, for example broken bones). The latter two offences may be committed [...] "with intent", meaning there is an additional <b>mens</b> <b>rea</b> component that makes the defendant more culpable for their actions. Whilst recklessness is sufficient for most offences against the person [...] that the defendant foresaw the risk of the proscribed injury occurring without necessarily intending it to happen [...] this is insufficient for crimes of intent.|$|E
