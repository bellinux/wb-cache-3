5000|$|Ringdown {{is used in}} manual operation, as {{distinguished}} from automatic signaling by dialing a number. The signal consists of a continuous or pulsed alternating current (AC) signal transmitted over the line. It may be used {{with or without a}} telephone switchboard. The term originated in <b>magneto</b> <b>telephone</b> signaling in which cranking the magneto generator, either integrated into the telephone set or housed in a connected ringer box, would not only ring its bell but also cause a drop to fall down at the telephone exchange switchboard, marked with the number of the line to which the <b>magneto</b> <b>telephone</b> instrument was connected.|$|E
50|$|After {{his studies}} at Glasgow, Hancock {{went to work}} for the Dublin Telephone Exchange. At Dublin he gained {{experience}} in the workings of telephone systems with the Dublin Exchange that at the time had 900 subscribers who completed roughly 7,000 telephone calls every day.In August 1885, the Postal and Telegraph Department of the Legislative Council at Perth in the Western Australia colony had a vacancy to fill due to the recent death of the Superintendent of Telegraphs. The postmaster general had been charged with finding a permanent replacement who had knowledge of the workings of the telephone and telegraph. The local government was interested in the extension of the telegraph lines northward.In February 1886, Hancock arrived at Perth to become superintendent of telephones for the government. His duties were to establish telephone exchanges in Perth and Fremantle. Hancock supervised the construction of telephone equipment between Government House and the office of the Colony Secretary. He installed exchanges in Perth and Fremantle. The Bell and Blake <b>magneto</b> <b>telephone</b> was utilized. The early installation had 17 subscribers.Hancock constructed the telegraph lines that connected Perth to Roebourne, to Broome and Derby, and then to Hall's Creek and Wyndham. In January 1893, a telegraph office was opened at Wyndham. Lines were installed that connected to Kalgoorlie and Marble Bar. The telephone lines encountered difficulties with the native Aboriginal people, from insects that included ants and termites, excessive heat, and bushfires. Iron wire had to be utilized, as the copper wires melted.He supervised all electrical works in Western Australia, including the tramways and installation of submarine cables in the harbors at Fremantle and Bunbury. In 1894, Hancock was appointed government electrical engineer, a position he held until retirement due to poor health in 1922. On 27 May 1907, a fatal tramway accident occurred at Fremantle. Hancock, a Government electrical engineer, testified that he examined the tram’s braking system and stated the brakes were in working order.|$|E

25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones,</b> which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|R

5000|$|The Ohio Public Utilities Commission {{approved}} the $100,000 sale in August, 1971. [...] The company {{spent the next}} several years building a new central office and running new lines to its nearly 500 subscribers. Mr. Miller liked to say he was taking McClure from the horse and buggy era, directly to the jet age. In November, 1975, McClure residents at last gave up their hand-cranked <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones,</b> and the friendly operators working above the local store. The operators served as a personal answering service for the residents, and would volunteer before ringing the number if someone was at home, and if they weren't, where they were, or when they'd be home. For the first time, subscribers heard a dial tone upon lifting the receiver, instead of the familiar question: [...] "number please." ...|$|R

50|$|After World War II, {{rebuilding}} the devastated communications infrastructure was {{ordered by the}} General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) {{and became one of}} the country's top priorities. Iwatsu took full advantage of the situation and focused on developing and manufacturing telephones. Iwatsu's production facilities made significant advancements with the introduction of quality control and belt conveyors. The foundation for increasing production was laid. Iwatsu established its position as a telephone manufacturer. Iwatsu delivered <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones</b> and dial telephones to the Ministry of Telecommunications, and aircraft radio communications accessories to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Public Corporation, founded by the Japanese government in 1952, opened a big market for subscriber telephones and became Iwatsu's biggest client. NTT also allowed telephone sets and PBX systems to be commercially available in Japan. Iwatsu opened one branch office after another across Japan over four years to build a nationwide sales network.|$|R
5000|$|Bryant Pond in Woodstock, Maine {{was known}} as having the last manual <b>magneto</b> (hand-crank) <b>telephone</b> {{exchange}} in America. The family-owned Bryant Pond Telephone Company was operated from a two-position magneto switchboard {{in the living room}} of owners Barbara and Elden Hathaway. In 1981 the company was purchased by the Oxford County Telephone & Telegraph Company, a nearby larger independent company, and automatic service was provided in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>telephone</b> <b>magneto</b> is a hand-cranked {{electrical}} generator that uses permanent magnets to produce alternating current from the rotating armature. In early telegraphy, magnetos {{were used to}} power instruments, while in telephony {{they were used to}} generate electrical current to drive electromechanical ringers in telephone sets and on operator consoles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telephone</b> <b>magnetos</b> {{featured}} a large gear rotated by {{hand with a}} handle, that drove a much smaller gear on the armature rotor, providing a high gear-ratio to increase the rotational speed of the magneto armature. A mechanical switch on the output terminals engaged only when the rotor was turning, so that the magneto was normally disconnected from the telephone circuitry.|$|R
2500|$|In {{rural areas}} with <b>magneto</b> crank <b>telephones</b> {{connected}} to party lines, the local phone number {{consisted of the}} line number plus the ringing pattern of the subscriber. To dial a number such as [...] "3R122" [...] meant making a request to the operator the third party line (if making a call off your own local one), followed by turning the telephone's crank once, a short pause, then twice and twice again. Also common was a code of long and short rings, so one party's call might be signaled by two longs and another's by two longs followed by a short. [...] It was not uncommon to have over a dozen ring cadences (and subscribers) on one line.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the same}} period two schemes of {{wireless}} signaling were put forward by William Henry Ward (1871) and Mahlon Loomis (1872) that {{were based on the}} erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. Both inventors' patents noted this layer connected with a return path using [...] "Earth currents"' would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries, and could also be used for lighting, heat, and motive power. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 <b>magneto</b> electric <b>telephone</b> that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.|$|R

50|$|This {{growth in}} {{earnings}} was possible, in part, {{as a result}} of rate increases that the company won in 1951 and 1954. In 1958, when Rochester Telephone petitioned the state public utilities commission for yet another rate increase, the anger of some of its customers again spilled over onto the editorial pages of newspapers. Some Rochester Telephone customers in outlying areas were still forced to rely on <b>magneto</b> crank <b>telephones,</b> and in certain suburbs customers were grouped into four- and eight-party lines. The company's preoccupation with the all-important and enormously expensive dial conversion effort had resulted in serious lapses in service in other areas. After the Public Utilities Commission publicly scolded Rochester Telephone for its inept management—calling its incompetent conduct of business 'inexcusable'--the company underwent a major reorganization, and a significant portion of its management was replaced.|$|R
