40|$|During {{commissioning}} of the IR Demo FEL at Jefferson Lab, {{we noticed}} that the FEL exhibited a rapid power drop with time when {{the first set of}} 3 mu-m mirrors was used. Thought the rate of power drop was unexpected, it was thought that it could be due to a distortion of the mirrors during a time short compared to a the thermal diffusion time. This transient distortion might affect the laser more than the steady state distortion. This paper presents some analysis of the transient <b>mirror</b> <b>heating</b> problem and some recent experimental results using different mirror substrates and coatings. It is found that the behavior of the first mirror set cannot be reconciled with the observed power fall-off if a linear absorption is assumed. The power drop in more recent experiments is consistent with linear thermal analysis. No anomalous transient effects are seen...|$|E
40|$|The imaging {{quality of}} the {{projection}} optics of an extreme ultraviolet lithography scanner degrades {{under the influence of}} thermally induced deformations of its mirrors. Wavefronts of different reticle points encounter different parts of the deformed mirrors, resulting in a field dependent wavefront error. This paper presents how ideas from multi-conjugate adaptive optics can be used to reduce these thermally induced aberrations. To this end a generic deformable mirror model is implemented. Linear actuator sensitivities are derived directly, based on nominal ray locations and directions, enabling fast prototyping. An integrated opto-thermo-mechanical <b>mirror</b> <b>heating</b> model is used to determine the evolution of thermally induced abberations over time. This transient simulation is used to analyze four different adaptive optics configurations and two different control algorithms.

40|$|The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (formerly {{known as}} CEBAF) has {{embarked}} {{on the construction of}} a 1 kW free-electron laser operating initially at 3 microns that is designed for laser-material interaction experiments and to explore the feasibility of scaling the system in power and wavelength for industrial and Navy defense applications. The superconducting radio-frequency linac, and single-pass transport which accelerates the beam from injector to wiggler, followed by energy-recovery deceleration to a dump. The electron and optical beam time structure in the design consists of a train of pecosecond pulses at a 37. 425 MHz pulse repetition rate. The initial optical configuration is a conventional near-concentric resonator with transmissive outcoupling. Future upgrades of the system will increase the power and shorten the operating wavelength, and utilize a more advanced resonator system capable of scaling to high powers. The optical system of the laser has been mode led using the GLAD code by using a Beer&#x 27;s-law region to mimic the FEL interaction.

40|$|The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) is in {{the process}} of {{building}} a 1 kW free-electron laser operates at 3 microns. The details of the accelerator driver are given in other papers in these proceedings. The optical cavity consists of a near-concentric resonator with transmissive outcoupling. Though several free-electron lasers have used similar designs, they have not had to confront the high average-power loading present in this laser. It is useful to know the limits of this type of optical cavity design. The optical system of the laser has been modeled using the commercial code GLAD{reg_sign} by using a Beer`s-law region to mimic the FEL interaction. The effects of <b>mirror</b> <b>heating</b> have been calculated and compared with analytical treatments. The magnitude of the distortion for several materials and wave-lengths has been estimated.

Results of calculations of the maximum power level expected using several different sets of mirrors will be presented. Measurements of the distortion in calcium fluoride from absorption of carbon dioxide laser light are planned to benchmark the simulations.

40|$|Thermal {{noise of}} the test masses is {{expected}} to be a limiting factor in Advanced Gravitational Waves (GW) Interferometers. Many research groups work on R&D activities finalized to improve the thermal noise performance of next generation detectors. Some research lines deal with cryogenic temperature, other with improved or new materials, other with optical beam shaping and optimization of the mirror geometry and/or coating. Non Gaussian beams have been proposed years ago to reduce a particular type of thermal noise (substrate thermoelastic). In this thesis we provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of non-Gaussian beams on different kinds of thermal noises. We show that the mesa beam implementation could boost the Advanced LIGO sensitivity considerably: even with a rough estimation (without re-optimizing the detector for the introduction of mesa beams), the binary neutron star inspiral range increases from 175 Mpc to 225 Mpc. We illustrate the importance of uniform sampling of the mirror surface to reduce thermal noise and the limitation brought by the use of excited modes with nodes on the mirror surface. We developed the theory of mesa beam, in view of a future implementation in advanced GW interferometers of the mesa beam idea, focusing on the analytical derivation of the quantities (beam width, divergence, M 2 factor, etc [...] .), which are chosen as ISO standard reference parameters for the characterization of an optical beam. We also analytically proved a new duality relation between optical cavities with nonspherical mirrors. This derivation provides a unique mapping between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of two cavities whose mirrors shapes are related by a simple relation. This duality allows the direct application of beam property calculations performed in a case to geometries of the other configuration. The interest of the GW community in this new beam technology led us to the construction and testing of a prototype mesa beam Fabry-Perot cavity with mexican-hat mirror. Part of the work of this thesis was devoted to the development of new simulation programs of optical systems. These programs provided the theoretical expected behavior of our experiment, in particular cavity’s modes structure and misalignments sensitivity to be confronted with the experimental results. We developed new simulation packages to analyze the performance of our cavity prototype with real imperfect mirrors, using the measured mirrors maps. The model developed can include uniform and non-uniform scattering and absorption losses, as well as the effects of <b>mirror</b> <b>heating</b> A particular attention has been devoted to keep theses simulation programs very easy to use and very easy to change/upgade by anyone involved in optics research. The good agreement between theory and experiment validated the mathematical tools here developed thus allowing safe extrapolation to the larger optical systems needed in GW observatories. We also explored another complementary way of reducing the mirror thermal noise, beside the beam shaping, that is the multi-layered coating thickness optimization. We show it to be effective in reducing the coating noise and explore the possible implications for GW interferometers in terms of sensitivity. During this analysis we developed an independent model for the coating effective elastic parameters, which is based on the well understood subject of homogenization theory...|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{conductive}} and convective {{forms of}} heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated {{in a tiny}} spot by using reflecting mirrors.
