25|$|Soon I found <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main bandstand {{before this}} {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular {{song of the}} day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

500|$|In March 1984, {{the film}} began {{production}} in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, {{the style of}} the film changed, explaining that [...] "the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set doing things I didn't think I would do– scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant." [...] Most of The Terminators action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley lived a {{literary}} life. Her father {{encouraged her to}} learn to write by composing letters, and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories. Unfortunately, all of Mary's juvenilia were lost when she ran off with Percy in 1814, and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year. Her first published work is often {{thought to have been}} Mounseer Nongtongpaw, comic verses written for Godwin's Juvenile Library when she was ten and a half; however, the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works. Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelley's writing: [...] "My husband was, from the first, very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page of fame. He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Napoleon {{embarked}} {{aboard the}} brig Épervier {{early in the}} morning of 15 July, and made his way out to the Bellerophon. As he approached, the 74-gun Superb, flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach Bellerophon before the Superb arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent Bellerophons barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 am, the barge pulled alongside Bellerophon and General Henri Gatien Bertrand climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The marines came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his hat off to Maitland and in French announced [...] "I am come to throw <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protection of your Prince and your laws." [...] Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian David Cordingly, this moment was Bellerophons [...] "crowning glory [...] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo,... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I thought I was gentle with them, and they thought I was laughing at them." ...|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, he {{was cast}} as Angela Channing's (Jane Wyman) lawyer Greg Reardon in {{the soap opera}} Falcon Crest, without {{requiring}} an audition. MacCorkindale asked for the character, originally an American named Brad, to be rewritten as English, and also directed one episode. He rejected a contract extension after appearing in 59 episodes and left the series in 1986 because he [...] "felt that the work I was doing was fun and lucrative but not as stretching as I felt I wanted or needed. I also was finding fault {{with much of the}} work, not only Falcon Crest, but everything. I was actually ready to quit acting and try producing so I could put <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{possesses}} a full lyric soprano vocal range that spans 3 octaves. She {{is known for}} having an aggressive vocal delivery, incorporated with a soulful and emotive, distinct tone. Since the start of her career, Amerie has been heavily involved within the creative process of her music, receiving not only writing credits but production and instrumentation credits as well. In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: [...] "I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. I would start by recording <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, I would play it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them onto the second tape. I'd just keep repeating the process, {{going back and forth}} between tapes until I had a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!".|$|E

2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes when I hear <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about {{trying to pick up}} the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E
2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike me in a way, for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) and I hit on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track in my place during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that I had bought completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The get-up was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E
2500|$|At {{one o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of April 2, 1865, my {{regiment}} broke camp near Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my ear and one in my left side and while removing the third line, a bullet shattered my right knee-joint, costing me, subsequently, the loss of my leg. Supporting <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abatis, I gave my orders to my men, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the enemy's works.|$|E

2500|$|At 10:25am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were {{swarming}} {{around them}} and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company. As they de-bussed to throw back the crowd, the rear vehicle noticed that the Iraqi Militia contingent were {{no longer in the}} convoy. Such was the intensity of the rock throwing and the sheer numbers of locals in the crowd, Bravo took the decision to fire rubber bullets at the ringleaders. Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation, they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets that the British were here to [...] "rape the women [...] attack them!" [...] One of the ringleaders was identified, and a Corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from [...] away. After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so {{it was a matter of}} pride that they returned fire. At 10:30am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqi's dying. One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers. The British troops fired on him first as they thought he was going to shoot, and after that, the crowd became completely hostile. At this point, the RMPs were only [...] away from the Paratroopers. Ahmed Younis, a member of the crowd on the morning, said The market was very crowded. I threw <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and shouted to everyone to run away or get down. The shooting lasted about five minutes but there were bullets going everywhere. They were firing on automatic. I couldn't believe it when they started shooting. Sheikh Shejar said [...] The Iraqi side fired first. Later they went to the police station and attacked there. The mob wanted to shelter at the police station and use it as a base to attack the British.|$|E
