5000|$|A <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> {{also known}} as a {{vertical}} calciner, is used for continuous preparation and calcining of materials. The <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> consists of several circular hearths or kilns superimposed on each other. Material is fed from the top and is moved by action of rotating [...] "rabble arms", and the revolving mechanical rabbles attached to the arms move over the surface of each hearth to continuously shift the ore. The arms are attached to a rotating central shaft that passes {{through the center of the}} roaster. As the material is moved, the ore that is charged at the top hearth gradually moves downward as it passes through windows in the floor of each hearth or through alternate passages around the shaft and the periphery until it finally emerges at the bottom. The oxidizing gases flow upward, i.e. , counter current to the descending charge. In a well - insulated roaster, external heating is unnecessary except when the charge is highly moist. The hearth at the top of the roaster dries and heats the charge. [...] and oxidation of the charge occur lower down.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to setup a {{simulation}} environment that prepares the ground for <b>Multiple</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnace</b> (MHF) advanced process control development based on Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) and/or MPC techniques. Additionally, the interest is to design an Economic MPC for the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnace,</b> aiming to minimize energy consumption of the furnace while maintaining the specified product quality. The implementation of the EMPC requires a dynamic model which is simplified from a previously developed mechanistic model of the MHF. The simplified model is developed {{in the form of}} a nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener model, which is linearized at every sampling time to carry out the state estimation and MPC optimization tasks. As the accuracy of the simplified process model is crucial for performance of the EMPC, the thesis aims to compare the simulation results of the mechanistic model and the simplified one. The comparison of the models show that the simplified model follows accurately the mechanistic model in all cases. A description of the process of interest is given, with an emphasis in outlining the overall control strategy currently implemented. Next the components of the EMPC design are illustrated, including the overall strategy, the cost function and the necessary models of the process. Afterwards an implementation algorithm is provided comprising all the elements of the design, in order to obtain the optimal control of the MHF. Finally, practical problems regarding industrial implementations of temperature control in the hearth 4 are discussed and further research items outlined...|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{calcination}} derives {{its name from}} the Latin calcinare (to burn lime) due to its most common application, the decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide, in order to create cement. The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as [...] "calcine", regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.

40|$|Monitoring {{and control}} of process {{operations}} is highly essential in process industries for the successful operation of a chemical process. Control over process variables and other process variations ensure a reliable end product quality and provide stability and efficiency for the process. The process considered in this thesis is the calcination of Kaolin in a <b>Multiple</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> which consists of 8 hearths with four burners each on hearths 4 and 6 that supply the energy required for calcination. The aim of this thesis is to develop data based models for the gas temperature profile in the <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> which is a key process variable determining the gas-solid heat exchange, and thus, affecting the final product quality. The models can be utilized to forecast furnace dynamics, to develop a model-based control which reduces variations in the gas flow rates into the hearths {{as well as for}} model based optimization which determines the optimal gas flow rates to hearths 4 and 6. These benefits of the gas temperature profile prediction may help to minimize the energy consumed by the burners and also to improve the control of the final product quality while maintaining the quality constraints. In this thesis, the relevant literature on statistical data processing methods are reviewed and case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of data based modeling in mineral processing. Thereafter, required data-based static and dynamic models are constructed using statistical techniques such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the Partial Least Squares (PLS). The model accuracy is improved by combining the process data with the chemical engineering knowledge of the process. The models are constructed for the most common feed rates and finally validated using process data not used for training. Results are presented and the models were able to predict the gas temperature profiles in the furnace in each of the hearths; the dynamic models improved the model quality when compared to the static models. In addition, a future prediction of the temperature profile was carried out to confirm the ability of the dynamic models to predict the furnace behavior. Also, the possibility of utilizing the dynamic models for process control and optimization is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Incineration {{has been}} used as a {{disposal}} method for wastewater treatment biosolids for over sixty years. The first <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> for biosolids incineration was built in 1935 in Dearborn, MI. From that time through the late sixties, the multiple hearth was the thermal technique of choice for biosolids disposal. Today there are still some 150 - 175 aging multiple hearths in operation in North America. In the seventies, the fluid bed furnace became the preferred thermal technique for biosolids disposal, primarily due to tighter emission regulation and to increasing cost of auxiliary fuel. The first municipal fluid bed was installed in the USA at the Lynnwood, WA wastewater treatment plant in 1962. There have been over 125 fluid bed incinerators installed since then in North America. Since 1988 there have been 43 new municipal fluid bed systems installed. Among these new fluid bed installations, 11 replaced existing multiple hearths. The dominance of fluid bed over multiple hearth for the last three decades can be explained by the advantages of the fluid bed, which derive from the basic design differences between the tw...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} new {{temperature}} profile control strategy for kaolin calcination in the <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> (MHF) in order {{to improve the quality of}} the product. The overall control strategy for the MHF is developed as a three level control hierarchy: optimizing level, stabilizing level, and basic level. In the literature part of the thesis, first, the kaolin and its formation process is discussed. Next, the general information about calcination process is provided and the calcination of kaolin is discussed. Finally, few past researches having similar objective to this study are reviewed to study the various different control approaches developed so far and the possibility to implement them in our study. In the experimental part, analysis of the process is carried using the experimental data. During the data analysis, activation/ deactivation of the exothermic reaction in the hearth 4 is seen, which is crucial in determining the temperature profile of the furnace. Hence, the soft sensor based on the energy balance to estimate the intensity of the exothermic reaction, which plays a key role in developing the control strategy for the MHF, is developed. Both the static and dynamic energy balance equations are presented, calculated and compared in order to study the dynamic behaviour in the process. It is seen that the dynamic energy balance provides more accurate results than the static energy balance due to the consideration of the transition period...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} chemical, {{mechanical}} and metallographic studies of {{elements of the}} design of a <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> from the steel 1. 4837 and 1. 4857 according to EN 10295 : 2002 are given in order to establish possible causes of its emergency shutdown. Among the possible causes of failures of elements the following ones are considered: non-operation of the safety device, degradation of material properties, as well as development of cracks in these surfaces caused by the high temperature and force action. The study has found out that the basic chemical composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the construction material ensure normal operation of the furnace to a temperature of up to 10500 С. Exceeding this temperature and periodical heating and cooling of the basic elements (thermal cycles) leads to emission of complex carbide inclusions on the dendrite boundaries. Frequent thermal cycles as well as the significant heterogeneity in distribution of non-metallic inclusions and carbides leads to degradation of material properties. While establishing causes of a failure of a safety device, the authors have found out that the increase of the gap between the sleeves results in a relatively small change in the cutoff force by increasing the proportion of normal stresses from bending. A more significant increase in the shear force occurs at the minimum cross section of the pin offset {{from the edge of the}} plane. The results of the study suggest a modification of a chemical composition of the used steel grades and change of {{the design of a}} safety device pin...|$|E
