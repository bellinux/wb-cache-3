5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017â€“2020.|$|E
5|$|No further {{games were}} made in the Mana series until 2013, when Square Enix {{released}} Circle of Mana, a Japan-only card battle game for the GREE <b>mobile</b> <b>platform.</b> It was followed in 2014 by Rise of Mana, a Japan-only free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita, and in 2016 by Adventures of Mana, a 3D remake of Final Fantasy Adventure for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In August 2017, a 3D remake of Secret of Mana was announced for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows, for release on February 15, 2018.|$|E

40|$|The usage {{possibilities}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> and smart phones are increasing rapidly as they {{provide support for}} better processors, sensors and communications capabilities. This has for many companies resulted in an increased interest to explore the {{possibilities of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> {{and how they can}} be integrated in various business areas. As the usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> in industrial applications is a new area, it is difficult for companies to estimate their potential, and what contributions the different platforms can give. This master thesis investigates the possibilities and limitations for the consultant firm Combitech when integrating <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> and handheld devices in industrial applications. This is accomplished through a comparison between the platforms and by considering the possible areas of use for the <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> based on experiences from companies and research in the area. For a company with the intent to deliver services that use <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms,</b> {{it is important to be}} able to combine expertise and resources to effectively attract customers. The <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> will, if applied right, give great possibilities in industrial applications as a cost-effective alternative for both hardware and software solutions for businesses, which provides an opportunity to sell services to both established and new clients. Since the market for <b>mobile</b> <b>platforms</b> is undergoing major changes which have led to some platforms growing in market shares with an exponential increase, while others are forced to build new platforms from scratch, it is important for a company that wants to use them to continually monitor developments in the field to avoid investing resources that will not generate income...|$|R
50|$|Ericsson <b>Mobile</b> <b>Platforms</b> was a {{supplier}} of technology platforms for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA/HSPA platforms used in devices, such as mobile handsets and PC cards. Through Ericsson <b>Mobile</b> <b>Platforms,</b> Ericsson licensed open-standard, end-to-end interoperability-tested GSM/EDGE and WCDMA technology platforms. The product offering included reference designs, platform software, {{application-specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC) designs and development boards, development and test tools, training, support and documentation. Ericsson <b>Mobile</b> <b>Platforms</b> had operations at nine global locations, with main operations in Sweden.|$|R
5|$|The {{first game}} in the series, Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon, is a Mystery Dungeon game {{released}} in 1997, while the latest is Chocobo no Chocotto Nouen, a 2012 farming game for the GREE <b>mobile</b> <b>platform.</b> A new {{game in the}} series, Chocobo Racing 3D, was cancelled in 2013. In addition to Square and Square Enix, the games have been developed by several other companies, including h.a.n.d., Bottle Cube, and Smile-Lab. Eight albums of music from Chocobo games have been produced and published by Square Enix, DigiCube, and Toshiba EMI, and an additional album of Chocobo-related music from both the Chocobo and Final Fantasy series, Compi de Chocobo, was released in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{four more}} games were {{released}} {{as part of}} the World of Mana subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were Children of Mana (2006), an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the Nintendo DS; Dawn of Mana (2006), a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; Friends of Mana (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; and Heroes of Mana (2007), a real-time strategy game for the DS. Children was developed by Nex Entertainment and Heroes by Brownie Brown, founded by several developers of Legends, though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the World of Mana subseries ended: Circle of Mana (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the GREE <b>mobile</b> <b>platform,</b> Rise of Mana (2014), a Japan-only free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita, and Adventures of Mana (2016), a 3D remake of Final Fantasy Adventure for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the Mana franchise.|$|E

25|$|A scenery wagon, {{also known}} as a stage wagon, is a <b>mobile</b> <b>platform</b> that is used to support and {{transport}} movable, three-dimensional theatrical scenery on a theater stage. In most cases, the scenery is constructed on top of the wagon such that the wagon, and the scenery it supports, forms a single, integrated structure. Heavy duty casters are mounted to the underside of the platform so that the entire assembly can be quickly moved onstage or offstage, so as to facilitate rapid scenery changes during live productions. Scenery wagons are built {{in a wide range of}} sizes, ranging from less than one square foot up to the size of the playing area of the stage.|$|E

25|$|The Weylandâ€“Yutani {{commando}} team arrives, {{including a}} man who looks identical to Bishop, who explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a <b>mobile</b> <b>platform,</b> which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weylandâ€“Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in a late effort to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-a-like with a wrench and is shot dead. Ignoring Bishop's pleas {{to give them the}} embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace as the infant queen erupts from her chest. Ripley grabs it to prevent it from escaping as they both fall into the furnace. The facility is closed and Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's recording from the first film plays for the final time in the EEV.|$|E
