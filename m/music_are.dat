5|$|Barbadian {{culture and}} <b>music</b> <b>are</b> {{mixtures}} of European and African elements, with minimal influence from {{the indigenous peoples}} of the island, about whom little is known. Significant numbers of Asian, specifically Chinese and Japanese, people have moved to Barbados, but their music is unstudied and has had little impact on Barbadian music.|$|E

5000|$|Follin's {{methodology}} of <b>music</b> <b>was</b> that <b>music</b> <b>is</b> [...] "basically an unconscious experience" [...] {{that does not}} and should not [...] "engage your intellect." [...] Rather, Follin believed game <b>music</b> <b>was</b> [...] "more of a sort of atmospheric thing" [...] and had [...] "always written <b>music</b> to <b>be</b> part of something else," [...] intending for the video game (or other media the <b>music</b> <b>is</b> composed for) to provide the image or scene of context.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and <b>music</b> <b>are</b> not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and <b>music</b> <b>are</b> inseparable.|$|E

5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and <b>music</b> <b>are</b> performed.|$|E

5|$|The ecclesiastical {{forms of}} Byzantine music, {{composed}} to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church <b>music,</b> <b>are,</b> today, {{the most well-known}} forms. Ecclesiastical chants were a fundamental part of this genre. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music {{is closely related to}} the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two.

Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as schlager <b>music,</b> <b>are</b> so prevalent that the festival is {{sometimes referred to as}} Schlagerfestivalen ("The schlager festival") by the Swedish media. However, other styles of music such as rap, reggae, and glam rock have made an appearance since the event's expansion. The {{introduction of}} a grand final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.|$|E

5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk <b>music</b> <b>are</b> closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most Barbadians. The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian Barbadians come together with family members to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week's work.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or <b>music</b> <b>are</b> heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} <b>music</b> <b>are</b> {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music {{is influenced by}} Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E

5|$|Although cinema, theatre, {{dance and}} live <b>music</b> <b>are</b> popular, the {{favourite}} pastime of the British is watching television. Public broadcast {{television in the}} United Kingdom began in 1936, with {{the launch of the}} BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels available on a national basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five.|$|E
