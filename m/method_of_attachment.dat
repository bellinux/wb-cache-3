500|$|Rudder, stern-mounted and {{vertical}} axial: Lawrence V. Mott, who defines a steering oar as a rudder, states the ancient Egyptian use of stern-mounted rudders {{can be traced}} back to the 6th dynasty (2350–2200 BC). Mott states that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> for rudders in the Arab, Chinese, and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment by socket-and-jaws or block and tackle (versus European pintle-and-gudgeon invented by c. 1180 AD). In regards to Mott's definition of a steering oar as a rudder, Joseph Needham, Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes, K.S. Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its helmsman, was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China. Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient Mediterranean world (specifically in regards to the Phoenicians, 1550–300 BC): [...] "A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break." [...] The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of oars or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC, while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the Huainanzi of the 2nd century BC, and K.S. Tom says the first clear reference dates to the 5th century AD. However, K.S. Tom points to the fact that all Chinese pottery models of ships before this Guangzhou tomb model show steering oars instead of a rudder, which he states is strong evidence for the rudder's invention only by the 1st century AD. Jacques Gernet states that while the Chinese had invented the rudder in the 1st century AD, it was not completely fixed to the sternpost of Chinese ships until the end of the 4th century. The bulkhead ship design of the junk, which appeared roughly the same time as the rudder, provided the essential vertical components for the hinged axial rudder. Deng points out that an Eastern Han (25–220) model distinctly shows a rudder located in its own separate cabin, suggesting that helmsmanship had already become an established profession. Following the invention of the balanced rudder pivoted on an axis, Tom and Deng state that the Chinese then innovated the fenestrated rudder by the Song Dynasty (960–1279), with deliberate puncturing and boring out of holes in shapes such as diamonds, which, according to Tom, made the rudder [...] "easier to steer, reduced turbulence drag, did not affect efficiency and was hydrodynamically sound." ...|$|E

60|$|Attachment.--Specimens are {{attached}} to various horny corallines, and occasionally to the peduncles of each other.[51] In both cases, supposing the coralline to be erect, the capitulum is placed upwards, with its orifice towards the branch {{to which it is}} attached, and consequently with its carina outwards. Where several are crowded in a group, their peduncles often become twisted and their positions irregular, with their orifices facing in any direction. This uniform position is simply the consequence of the larva attaching itself head-downwards, and from the position of the prehensile antennæ, necessarily with its sternal surface parallel and close to the branch of the coralline; hence the dorsal surface, which afterwards is converted into the carina, faces outwards. The peduncle, as already stated, often tapers, at its basal extremity, to a sharp point. In very young specimens, for instance in one with a capitulum only 1/20th of an inch in length, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> is the same as in Lepas and many other genera, namely, by cement proceeding exclusively from the antennæ of the larva; but in older and full-grown specimens, instead of the whole bottom of the peduncle becoming flattened and broadly attached, which would be here impossible, the cement is poured out through a straight row of orifices along the rostral edge, thus causing, by an excellent adaptation, a narrow margin to adhere firmly to the thin and cylindrical branches of the coralline. These orifices are represented, magnified seven times, in Pl. IX, fig. 7, in which the lower attached portion of the peduncle is split open and exhibited; they are circular, and stand at regular intervals, in a straight line; the higher orifices are larger, but further apart from each other than the lower ones; in one full-grown specimen, I counted ten of these orifices in a length of exactly a quarter of an inch. At each period of growth, the corium recedes a little from the attached portion of the peduncle; of which portion, the greater part is thus left empty and as incapable of further growth, as are the larval antennæ at the extreme point: in the specimen figured, the corium extended a little below the upper orifice. The prehensile antennæ, however, I must remark, do not strictly rise from the extreme point of the peduncle, but at a little distance from it, on the rostral surface; this simply ensues from the antennæ in the larva, being situated on the sternal surface, close to, but not actually {{on the front of the}} head. The two cement glands are seated high up on the sides of the peduncle, and remote from each other; they are small, unusually globular and transparent. The two cement-ducts (fig. 7 a a) proceeding from them, are 3/2000ths of an inch in diameter, and run in a zig-zag line; at the point where they pass through the corium to enter the lower attached portion of the peduncle, they become closely approximated, and partially imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle. Together they run along the rostral edge, giving out through each orifice a little disc of brownish cement, and finally they enter the larval antennæ. The peduncle, just above the attached portion, where still lined by corium, no doubt increases in diameter at each period of growth, and must, I presume, become pressed against the almost parallel branch of the coralline. The corium, at this same period, shrinks, or is absorbed, and the two cement-ducts come in contact with, and adhere to, the inner surface of the outer membrane of the peduncle; and then, by a process which I do not understand in this or any other Cirripede, apertures are formed both in the ducts and through the membrane, so that the cement passes through, firmly fastening the outer surface of the peduncle with its calcareous scales and spines, to the coralline.|$|E
