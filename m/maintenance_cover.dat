Because <b>maintenance</b> <b>covers</b> the correction of errors,the enhancement, deletion and addition of capabilities, the adaption of changing data requirements and operational environment, the improvement in performance, usability and other quality related attributes. Once the modification has been implemented, the software system has to be retested to gain confidence that it will perform according to the specification. For which once again test suite needs to be designed to test the modified module and the entire software. So the time spent in maintenance can be reduced by reducing the no. of test cases. We proposed a methodology based on clustering by which we can significantly reduce the test suite...|$|R

40|$|A {{benefit of}} {{established}} water-wise landscapes is they require less {{time and money}} to maintain than a traditional landscape. This assumes you have limited turfgrass to areas where it is practical, you have selected plants adapted to your climate, and you have grouped landscape plants according to their water, soil, and exposure requirements. In such a landscape, you will spend less time trying to manipulate plants to fit your conditions, and more time enjoying their beauty. Although the activities required to maintain a water-wise landscape are not different from those of a conventional landscape, the way you think about them will change as you reconsider your plant selections. The main activities of water-wise landscape maintenance are irrigation and irrigation system <b>maintenance</b> (<b>covered</b> separately in other fact sheets), weed control, fertilization, pruning, and pest and disease control.

40|$|In the UK, {{building}} maintenance {{makes up}} more than 50 % of total construction output while reactive <b>maintenance</b> <b>covers</b> {{two thirds of the}} overall building maintenance projects. It was therefore found not surprisingly that reactive maintenance work receives the most complaints and gives more negative impacts on business activities in terms of time, cost, and {{the health and safety of}} the users. As this type of maintenance work is mostly carried out by firms with less than 20 employees, which constitutes 84 % of the industry, reactive maintenance is hence, the major focus of this study. The aim of the research is to demonstrate how inexpensive IT and communication tools can lead to enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of minor construction projects. Process analysis was carried out to provide valuable insights into the existing business process of reactive maintenance and also the information and communication technology that is being used by the parties involved in the process. It unearthed problems that impede the process in terms of time, cost, quality of work and the health an...|$|R

However, it would also serve visotors to the scenic Ruhr valley, which was a place of recreation. In May 1889, Krupp requested the königlichen Eisenbahn-Direktion (Royal Railway Division) of Essen to establish Haltestelle Bredeney (Bredeney halt), which would be located between Werden and Rellinghausen stations at the 2.7 km mark (from Essen) on the Essen-Werden-Essen railway. The railway line was built in 1877 by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company, originally as a single-track line. The construction costs of Hügel station were met by Friedrich Krupp AG, with <b>maintenance</b> <b>covered</b> by the state. From 1896 a post office was housed in the station’s ticket office for which the station master was responsible. However, this post office was only accessible by members of the Krupp family and employees of Hügel Park. It was listed until 1924 as an independent post office under the name of Krupp-Postamt (Krupp post office).|$|R
