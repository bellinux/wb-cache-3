You talked of the raven that scented out the slaughter from afar; but here's a blue pigeon (somewhat {{of the oldest and}} toughest, I grant) who smelled the good news six or seven miles off, flew thither in the taxed-cart, and returned with the olive branch." ...|$|E
5000|$|The President or CEO of Hasbro was at {{a charity}} event that Marvel’s President was also at. They {{ended up in the}} men’s room, {{standing}} next to each other peeing, and I think that’s how they met. They were talking about each other’s respective businesses, and it came up that Hasbro wanted to reactivate the trademark on G.I. Joe, but they were {{trying to come up with}} a new approach. guy was like ‘We have the best creative people in the world! Let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> this Editor-in-Chief of mine and we’ll fix it for you! ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Roger Raupp, he [...] "was into {{science fiction}} as a kid, but {{my parents were}} quite {{conservative}} and thought I was a little nuts. They wanted me {{to work on the}} farm, not sit around and read comic books and watch Godzilla movies all day." [...] Raupp developed an interest in art during childhood, and began playing the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game while in high school. As a freshman, Raupp [...] "was doing some art for a student magazine, which happened to be printed at the same plant where Dragon had camera work done. Tim Kask, who was then the editor of Dragon, happened to see some of my science-fiction and fantasy pieces, and told my art teacher to have <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a portfolio." [...] Dave Sutherland reviewed the samples, and told him to keep working; several months later, Raupp got his first assignment for an illustration for Dragon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{should not}} have forced me, Lady Manto,' said the Captain of the yacht, in a grumbling tone, to his partner. 'By {{weakening}} me, you prevented <b>me</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> my spades. We might have made the game.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Once two old fellows, {{while sitting}} by the fire, watched Frank and <b>me</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> wood for the kitchen stove, and smiled and muttered between {{themselves}} thereat. At last one of them patted my brother {{on the head and}} called out admiringly, [...] "Small pappoose, heap work--good!" [...] and we were very proud of the old man's praise.|$|R
6000|$|Some five or {{six years}} ago, in the Alpine Journal, Sir Martin Conway gave a lively and amusing account of his first meeting with A. D. M'Cormick, the artist who {{subsequently}} accompanied him to the Karakoram Himalayas. [...] "A friend," [...] he wrote, [...] "came to <b>me</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> his pocket a crumpled-up water sketch or impression of a lot of geese. I was struck by the breadth of the treatment, and I remember saying that the man who could see such monumental magnificence in a flock of geese ought {{to be the kind of}} man to paint mountains, and render somewhat of their majesty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mind it as weel as yesterday, Mistress," [...] {{said the}} Clerk; [...] "by {{the same token}} you gave me a note for my trouble, (which wasna worth {{speaking}} about,) and bade <b>me</b> no <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a bill against the puir bairns--ye had aye a kind heart, Mrs. Dods." ...|$|R
60|$|That single {{afternoon}} {{would thus}} <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> five hundred thousand pounds--provided the bookie did not blow his brains out.|$|R
6000|$|But, here Miss Bella repudiated, {{and said}} quietly, 'I {{can speak for}} myself; you know, ma. You needn't <b>bring</b> <b>ME</b> <b>in,</b> please.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{a father}} as yours may, I only wish {{that he was}} with us now, to assist <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> about what he must greatly desire, your return to England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will give}} you the golden horse,' said he, 'if you will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{exchange}} a golden maiden who has never yet seen either sun or moon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so tired, I {{will lie}} here and cuddle Teddy, and you shall <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> some tea," [...] she said, {{trying to speak}} cheerfully for their sakes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then receive Judith. And now, go hunting, and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> game. I want deer, roe, fowls; {{anything}} and everything from the greatest to the smallest. Go and hunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The prince told me, {{half an hour}} since. He {{heard it}} from the Admiral. He told me he wished he was going with you, instead of with the army. He is always thirsting after adventure. He bade <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>in</b> to him, if you came. I said you would be sure to do so. It was useless my going out to look for you, as I could not tell what {{you might have to}} do before starting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be difficult," [...] he went on; [...] "not near {{as tough}} as that case you won for <b>me.</b> You can <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> all the bosh about his {{claiming}} to be an author, you know. And I'll stand expenses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One don't know, sir. Nothin' is {{done without}} tryin', and by tryin' more is often done than was hoped for. I have a scheme in my head, and Providence may favour <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> it about." ...|$|R
60|$|And I {{hope that}} they'll <b>bring</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> Paradise, To green lanes leafy wi' bough and stem-- To a country {{place in the}} land o' the skies, And not to the New Jerusalem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your sorrow don't <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my five dollars," [...] {{the valet}} {{retorted}} bitterly. [...] "There's only two suites on this floor to work for, anyway, {{and this is}} the only one worth a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir. I don't see why {{you should}} <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> here to tell me {{anything}} that is so publicly known as that. With such a herald as Lady Julia it was quite unnecessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall make}} Stephen <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the spring," [...] Nora promised. [...] "I shall never forget how fascinated {{we were with}} the whole place this last summer. Don't forget that you {{are coming to the}} House with me {{tomorrow}} afternoon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cavallari {{also stated}} that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> <b>in,</b> because I know what works". Cavallari later told Ryan Seacrest that her {{relationships}} with Jenner and Brescia were fabricated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will give}} you the golden apple,' said the owner of the garden, 'if you will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{exchange}} a horse which can go round the world in four-and-twenty hours.' And the young man departed, and went to find the fox.|$|R
6000|$|Amelius owned, very reluctantly, that {{he could}} do nothing with the old woman who had been the accomplice. [...] "Unless," [...] he added, [...] "I can induce her to assist <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> the man to justice for other crimes which I believe him to have committed." ...|$|R
60|$|There, there, I am a fool! Tears! I have {{sometimes}} {{been moved to}} tears by a chapter of fine writing in a novel; but what have I to do with tears now? All depends on me--Father, this poor girl, the farm, everything; and they both love me--I am all in all to both; and he loves me too, I am quite sure of that. Courage, courage! and all will go well. (Goes to bedroom door; opens it.) How dark your room is! Let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>in</b> here where there is still full daylight. (Brings EVA forward.) Why, you look better.|$|R
500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than <b>me</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A custom I devoutly hope King Harry will break!' exclaimed Ralf. 'If not, I'll {{some day}} find the way between those painted ribs of Monseigneur de la Mort, I can tell him! I had nearly {{given him a}} taste of my sword as it was, only some Gascon rogue caught my arm, and he was off ere I could get free. So I jumped off, that your poor corpse should not be trodden by French heels; and I hardly know how it was, but the Lady Esclairmonde was by my side as I dragged you out, and caused these good folks to let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>in</b> behind their shop.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{did you not}} <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> up <b>in</b> that way, mamma?" [...] said Gwendolen. But {{immediately}} perceiving in {{the crushed}} look and rising sob that she had given a deep wound, she tossed down her hat and knelt at her mother's feet crying-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] the Countess declared. [...] "Mr. Blatherwick <b>brings</b> <b>me,</b> {{sometimes}} <b>in</b> despair, sheets {{upon which}} he has been engaged for days. They are all just a hopeless tangle of figures and wild calculations! Nobody could possibly make anything coherent out of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] said she. [...] "I know that {{here in the}} city you are very busy making money all the time, so I must not stay long. Will you buy me some stocks,--some good safe stocks, which will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> at least four per cent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{shall have}} the vine {{if you will}} <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{exchange}} an apple off the golden apple-tree that flowers every twenty-four hours, and bears fruit of gold.' So saying, he gave orders that the simpleton should be released, and this done, the youth hurried off to consult the fox.|$|R
60|$|For {{another week}} or more I {{remained}} upon the Blanche waiting till my full strength returned, also because Kari said I must do so. When I asked him why, he replied {{for the reason that}} he wished news of my coming to spread far and wide throughout the land from one tribe to another, which it would do with great swiftness, flying, as he put it, like a bird. Meanwhile, every day I sat upon the poop in the armour for an hour or more, and both these people and others from afar came to look at <b>me,</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> presents <b>in</b> such quantity that we knew not what to do with them. Indeed, they built an altar and sacrificed wild creatures to me, and birds, burning them with fire. Both those that I had seen and the other folk from a long way off made this offering.|$|R
6000|$|Thankful {{swung her}} feet {{in silence for a}} few moments, then {{suddenly}} leaped from the table, and, seizing the old man by the lapels of his coat, fixed her eyes upon him, and said suspiciously. [...] "Why did you keep me from going in the company-room? Why did you <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cooper," [...] he said, to {{the partner}} by that name, [...] "I've {{got to have}} $10,000 to-day or to-morrow. I've got a house and lot there that's worth about $6,000 and that's all the actual collateral. But I've got a cattle deal on that's sure to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> more than that much profit within a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only see {{how many}} buds!' and she placed it by his sofa. Is it not a perfect blossom, so pure a white, and so regular! And I am so proud of having beaten mamma and all the gardeners, for not another will be out this fortnight; and this {{is to go to}} the horticultural show. Sam would hardly trust <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> it <b>in,</b> though it was my nursing, not his.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Day was {{a member}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Throughout her life she never swore, smoked, or drank any kind of alcohol, coffee or tea. Until her death in 2007, she {{retained}} her Mormon faith, stating that: [...] "It <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> comfort <b>in</b> a confusing world".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust the}} {{important}} object I {{have had in}} view here is a sufficient excuse for my breach of promise to you; and I am serious when I wish you (unless the pretty Spaniard has, as I sometimes suspect, made you a captive) to see, and endeavor to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> some degree connected with, the charming family of Sir Edward Moseley.|$|R
