5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Behavior {{is known}} <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} {{data from the}} other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E

These new arrivals included some Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia. The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans who arrived in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are often referred to as old stock Canadians.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Afrika Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Goan Catholic settlers, who {{migrated}} to Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 in three major waves. The {{first wave of}} immigrants came to Mangalore to escape the trials of the Goa Inquisition of 1560. These migrants were welcomed by the native Bednore rulers of Canara for their agricultural skills. They were followed by a second major wave precipitated by the Portugal–Adil Shahi wars between 1570 and 1579. A final influx of immigrants arrived during the Portugal–Maratha wars in Goa during the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. According to Mangalorean historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 {{by the time of}} the capture of Canara by Hyder Ali in 1765.|$|E
