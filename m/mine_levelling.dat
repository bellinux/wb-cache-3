40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{contains}} {{a new approach}} to calculate subsidence induced by mining. Its essence consists in combining reliable empirical data with rigorous accounting for compatibility conditions in 3 D multi-layered media. The mathematical tool employed is the fast Fourier transform. It serves us for efficient solution of 3 D elasticity equations for tens and even hundreds of layers. Stresses at the Earth surface are zero. At the <b>mining</b> <b>levels,</b> displacement discontinuities are considered to be proportional to the extracted thickness. Low- or no-friction contacts are presumed. Normal displacements at contacts may be continuous or include contact dilation. The layers are considered to be isotropic, homogeneous and elastic. Asymptotic formulae for high and low frequencies are used to increase accuracy and decrease the time of calculations. Layers being normally thin, the accepted presumptions do not distort the subsidence picture significantly given the boundary conditions at the <b>mining</b> <b>level</b> are prescribed in terms of displacements. This allows us to introduce necessary corrections accounting for strongly nonlinear effects discussed in the paper. The corrections are made automatically in the computer program Lay-Subsid developed by the authors. Numerical results and examples are given. They show flexibility and potential of the suggested approach for subsidence prediction and for further development of the code...|$|R

50|$|Lower silver grade, {{increased}} zinc, and {{the increased}} expenses of pumping water from the deeper <b>mine</b> <b>levels</b> forced the Elkhorn mine to close down in 1894. The Granite-Bimetallic mines shut down in September 1893 because they had exhausted the ore. Additionally, the Alice Lexington, Moulton, Alta, and Comet mines closed between 1893 and 1897 because of low silver prices following repeal of the Sherman Act. Some mines, such as the Hope and Castle mines were able to remain open into the early 1890s due the discoveries of new orebodies, but they had little success.|$|R
30|$|Laterally, at the <b>mining</b> <b>level,</b> {{the water}} {{pressure}} started to increase {{at a distance}} of 300  m ahead of the LW face, indicating that mining induced stress can extend to 300  m ahead. Water pressures dropped rapidly between 100  m ahead of the LW face and 170  m behind the LW face, implying that mining-induced strata fractures and stress changes are developed within this region. Further behind the LW face the water pressure was either stabilised or started to recover, suggesting that the goaf is being consolidated and the mining induced fractures are being compacted in this zone.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{returns to}} scale (RTS) is {{frequently}} po stulated as affecting productivity in surface coal mining. However, it is not cl ear whether increased capital intensity or increased output is the relevant phen omenon. A ray-homothetic production function that incorporates the capital labor mix and fixed site geology into the scale elasticity is presented and estimated with a micro (<b>mine</b> <b>level)</b> dataset. The results indicate that higher capital int ensity contributes to higher RTS for some types of capital equipment, but not al l. On the average, increasing RTS was found, with few mines approaching optimal scale. Copyright 1987 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

These include coal price variability, technological or regulatory change and increased costs of environmental remediation. Risks at the <b>mine</b> <b>level</b> include capital costs, mine age, size and changes to corporate structure.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the Australian coal industry has highlighted the difficulties the industry faces arising from reduced world coal prices, escalating production costs and overall declining levels of profitability, despite strong demand for coal – a situation that {{has been described as}} one of ‘profitless prosperity’. In response to these difficulties, management in the industry have sought, via enterprise bargaining, to increase labour flexibility and productivity and weaken union control at the <b>mine</b> site <b>level.</b> This paper seeks to empirically investigate these changes at the <b>mine</b> site <b>level</b> by examining the contents of certified agreements struck in the coal mining districts of NSW and Queensland since 1995. The analysis focuses on bargaining outcomes with respect to changing work organisation, external labour arrangements, union security and retrenchment provisions and other relevant industrial relations issues which, collectively, illustrate the extent of industrial relations change in the coal industry. We argue that the frontier of control at the <b>mine</b> site <b>level</b> has shifted considerably in favour of management during the 1990 s, although not to the extent expected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Master {{event and}} double-difference {{techniques}} {{were used to}} relocate mining-induced seismicity (MIS) at the Trail Mountain Mine, a longwall coal mine in central Utah. Travel-time data were collected by Arabasz et al. (2002) using a sur-face seismic network with stations at elevations both above and below <b>mine</b> <b>level</b> (because of the topography) and a single in-mine station. Arabasz et al. (2002) only used surface stations above <b>mine</b> <b>level</b> to determine locations. Using this network geometry, they were only able to constrain focal depths for 321 of 1829 events. In contrast, we use all stations, creating a 3 D network. Hypocentral locations are im-proved by implementing a master event methodology to reduce the effects of uncer-tainties in the velocity structure, though the resulting locations do not correspond with known structures or stratigraphy. The mismatch between the locations and geology is likely due to fracturing of the rock mass by the mining process, thereby decreasing the seismic velocity near mined-out regions. Assuming a 10 % velocity decrease places the MIS in {{the roof of the}} mine. A double-difference procedure is used to mimic a time-varying velocity structure. The time-varying velocity structure results in locations that approximate the dip of the coal seam. By using all available stations and allowing for a time-varying velocity structure, we find the MIS is located immediately above the coal seam and closely follows the position of the coalface. The epicenters align with the roads along the longwall panel, where stress concentrations are expected during mining.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Breiner Băiuţ epithermal vein – type deposit is {{basically}} a base metal ore body with important amounts of gold and silver. The frequency distribution pattern of the major elements (Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, S) is complex in many cases, but at some <b>mining</b> <b>levels</b> it is lognormal. The correlation coefficient "r " has been calculated for six pairs of major elements. The values are positive and indicate strong correlations between these elements. The average grades values for each major element at all levels {{have been used to}} highlight the vertical variation of chemistry of the mineralization. The ore body consists of zones rich in different elements interlayered with poorly mineralized zones...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A co-offending {{network is}} {{a network of}} {{offenders}} who have committed crimes together. Recently different researches have shown {{that there is a}} fairly strong concept of network among offenders. Analyzing these networks can help law enforcement agencies in designing more effective strategies for crime prevention and reduction. One of the important tasks in co-offending network analysis is central actors identification. In this paper, firstly we introduce a data model, called unified crime data level and co-offending network <b>mining</b> <b>level.</b> Using this data model, we extract the co-offending network of five years real-world crime data. Then we apply different variations of centrality methods on the extracted network and discuss how key player identification and removal can help law enforcement agencies in policy making for crime reduction.
