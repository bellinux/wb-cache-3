5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach would first <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in}} a notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a codified system.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} ways to properly muffle a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced or {{do not know how}} much foam to apply, the person should apply it to the outside of the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of how much foam was applied for future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed on the drum. This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E
500|$|Newton met Holmes {{early in}} October 1975 when, the former claimed, {{he was given}} {{a down payment on a}} fee of £10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an {{agreement}} that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself [...] "Peter Keene", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to have been hired to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man. This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier, and he agreed to meet [...] "Keene" [...] at a later date. However, he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of the stranger's car registration number.|$|E

500|$|Hastings {{finished}} the book {{just before the}} court vacation ended, and presented the draft to Gill immediately. Gill did not offer Hastings a place in his chambers but instead gave him {{a copy of a}} brief [...] "to see if he could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> on it that would be any use to [...] ". He spent hours writing notes and [...] "did everything to the brief except set it to music", before returning it to a pleased Gill, who let him take away another brief. Over the next two years Gill allowed him to work on nearly every case he appeared in. Eventually he was noticed by solicitors, who left briefs for him rather than for Gill. By the end of his first year as a barrister, he had earned 60 guineas, {{and by the end of}} his second year he had earned £200 (equivalent to approximately £ and £ respectively in 2015).|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust {{and author of the}} Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became [...] "the most {{important}} country house in Europe". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own [...] "little Foreign Office... the hub of resistance". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, [...] "I do not usually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, [...] "there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late".|$|E
2500|$|If Rivers {{ever did}} come to access the veiled memory then he {{does not appear to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of it so the nature of the {{experience}} is open to conjecture. One such supposition was put forward by Pat Barker, in the second novel in her Regeneration Trilogy, The Eye in the Door. Whatever the case, in the words of Barker's character Billy Prior, Rivers's experience was traumatic enough to cause him to [...] "put his mind's eye out".|$|E

2500|$|... "This Little Light" [...] {{is based}} around [...] "This Little Light of Mine", a gospel song written by American {{composer}} Harry Loes {{in the early}} 20th century. It first appeared on LZ7's EP Gasoline, which was released in the UK in August 2008. It was then remixed in 2010 for inclusion as track one on the band's second studio album, Light, and {{was used as a}} theme song for both The Message Trust's charitable initiative Shine Your Light and the UK government's Shine Week 2010. LZ7 launched the 2010 remix at a gig at the Manchester Apollo, before promoting the track at summer festivals and an eight-date schools tour around Manchester. The band encouraged people to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of the release date and to download the single, with Lindz West, LZ7's frontman, remarking: [...] "What we don't want is anyone phoning up stations and saying 'Why aren't you playing this song?', because that just creates a bad name for us in the first place. What we do want is people buying it and getting it to the position where it has to go on the radio airplay lists and the stations have to play it." ...|$|E
