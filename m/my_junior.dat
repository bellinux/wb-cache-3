500|$|Achebe also {{discussed}} a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: [...] "That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers {{in music and}} theology in Europe {{for a life of}} service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice {{in the days before the}} germ theory of disease came into being." [...] Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his [...] "reverence for life".|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... <b>My</b> <b>junior</b> year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E
2500|$|The poor {{conditions}} of the hospital in Lambaréné were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist Chinua Achebe in his essay on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness: [...] "In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate {{to the needs of}} junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice {{in the days before the}} germ theory of disease came into being." ...|$|E

2500|$|Long after Marinovich's {{professional}} career had ended, an ESPN columnist named the elder Marinovich one of history's [...] "worst sports fathers." [...] Regardless, the Sports Illustrated article was incorrect about his son's self-control. During high school, he started drinking in after-game parties and smoked marijuana daily. His {{use of marijuana}} grew {{to the point that}} he would meet with a group of friends—athletes, skaters, surfers and musicians—every day before school to share a bong before classes in what they nicknamed [...] "Zero Period." [...] Having previously dealt with social anxiety, Marinovich found marijuana relaxed him and did not affect him later during sporting events. The rumors of his use spread to opposing fans, however, who taunted him with chants of [...] "Marijuana-vich" [...] during basketball. His parents divorced around the time he transferred high schools, and he lived in a small apartment with his father for his final two high school seasons. Marinovich enjoyed the period, noting: [...] "Probably the best part of my childhood was me and Marv's relationship <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> and senior years. After the divorce, he really loosened up. It was a bachelor pad. We were both dating." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schweitzer was {{nonetheless}} still sometimes {{accused of being}} paternalistic, colonialist and racist in his attitude towards Africans, {{and in some ways}} his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism. For instance, he thought that Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. Edgar Berman quotes Schweitzer as having said in 1960, [...] "No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow." [...] Schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks, while also sometimes characterizing them as children. He summarized his views on European-African relations by saying [...] "The African is indeed my brother but <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> brother." [...] Chinua Achebe has criticized him for this characterization, though Achebe acknowledges that Schweitzer's use of the word [...] "brother" [...] at all was, for a European of the early 20th century, an unusual expression of human solidarity between Europeans and Africans. Schweitzer eventually emended and complicated this notion with his later statement that [...] "The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed". Later in life he became more convinced that [...] "modern civilization" [...] was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
