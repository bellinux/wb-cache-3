500|$|After {{spending}} {{nine months}} on the sidelines, Jesé returned from injury for the second leg of Real Madrid's tie against UE Cornellà in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on 2 December 2014, replacing Sami Khedira after 57 minutes and scoring the last goal of a 9–1 aggregate victory. On his injury, Jesé stated: [...] "I had a very tough time, but I think that things in life happen for a reason. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the injury because I needed to learn and become a more mature footballer." [...] Later that month he {{was included in the}} club's squad which won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, making a substitute appearance in a 4–0 win over Cruz Azul in the semi-finals. He scored the first of his three La Liga goals for the season on 4 February 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. Jesé struggled to break back into the first team following his injury though, starting only 3 of his 23 appearances for the season, {{and by the end of}} the campaign it was reported that he had grown frustrated at the club and was looking to leave in the summer.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} two months of writing and recording, Moraz was let go from the band, which he did not expect. Anderson thought he [...] "just wasn't playing like he was involved", and that his sound was not [...] "too good, and that {{affected}} his vibe ... it was obvious that he just wasn't getting off on what we were doing." [...] Several months after his exit, Moraz said he had to leave because of [...] "the enormous psychological pressures at the time within the group ... I felt there were a few things going on that I didn't know ... Unfortunately some people did not play the game fair, although the final decision was taken by all members." [...] The decision was made after Rick Wakeman, who left Yes in 1974 over differences surrounding their ambitious double album Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) and whom Moraz replaced, was invited to play on Going for the One as a session musician by Brian Lane, manager of Yes and Wakeman, and his business partner Alex Scott. Wakeman had pursued a successful solo career but by mid-1976, he faced money issues after his tour earlier in the year had met its minimal targets. He became interested to play with Yes again after he had heard a tape of early versions of two of their new songs, [...] "Going for the One" [...] and [...] "Wonderous Stories". Upon his arrival at Switzerland, Wakeman was surprised by how much the band had changed. [...] "We began relating to each other for the first time. I think we had all grown up and became much more mature. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to grow up more than them." [...] At a party held by Claude Nobs soon after Wakeman's arrival, Lane and Squire convinced Wakeman to rejoin as a full-time member as the group would have difficulty in finding a suitable replacement to play Wakeman's parts on their upcoming tour, but did not tell him that the press had already been informed of his return. Several hours after his decision, Wakeman found Melody Maker had printed [...] "Wakeman rejoins Yes" [...] on the front cover of its 4 December 1976 edition.|$|E

Before I could recover from the bewildering shock and speak to her she was gone. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen an apparition, but it was not so, she was flesh. She was the granddaughter of the other Mary, the {{original}} Mary. That Mary, now a widow, was up-stairs, and presently sent for me. She was old and gray-haired, but she looked young and was very handsome. We sat down and talked. We steeped our thirsty souls in the reviving wine of the past, the beautiful past, the dear and lamented past; we uttered the names that had been silent upon our lips for fifty years, {{and it was as if}} they were made of music; with reverent hands we unburied our dead, the mates of our youth, and caressed them with our speech; we searched the dusty chambers of our memories and dragged forth incident after incident, episode after episode, folly after folly, and laughed such good laughs over them, with the tears running down; and finally Mary said suddenly, and without any leading up-- ...|$|E
