40|$|As a {{possible}} way of modifying the intrinsic properties of graphene we study the doping of graphene by embedded boron clusters with density functional theory. Cluster doping is technologically relevant as the cluster implantation technique {{can be readily}} applied to graphene. We find that B 7 clusters embedded into graphene and graphene nanoribbons are structurally stable and locally <b>metallize</b> the system. This is done both by {{the reduction of the}} Fermi energy and by the introduction of boron states near the Fermi level. A linear chain of boron clusters forms a metallic "wire" inside the graphene matrix. In a zigzag edge graphene nanoribbon the cluster-related states tend to hybridize with the edge and bulk states. The magnetism in boron doped graphene systems is generally very weak. The presence of boron clusters weakens the edge magnetism in zigzag edge graphene nanoribbon, rather than making the system appropriate for spintronics. Thus the doping of graphene with the cluster implantation technique might be a viable technique to locally <b>metallize</b> graphene without destroying its attractive bulk properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} {{phase transition}} and the metallization of Ar(H 2) 2 are investigated using first-principles methods. A phase {{transition from the}} experimentally observed MgZn 2 structure to a CeCu 2 -type structure is predicted near 66 GPa. This phase transition provides a {{possible explanation for the}} disappearance of the Raman active vibron mode in experiment between 55 and 70 GPa. The metallization of the CeCu 2 structure is promoted by the intermolecular interactions among H 2 molecules, but hindered by the modulation of Ar atoms. The competition between these two mechanisms implies that the pressure for metallization in Ar(H 2) 2 is higher than that suggested for pure hydrogen. This prediction is a result of an examination of a previous proposal that hydrogen could <b>metallize</b> at much lower pressure by mixing with Ar, and provides insight for future studies on metallization of hydrogen through the use of hydrogen-rich mixtures.

30|$|Using {{bacterial}} flagella as biologically inspired templates is {{a relatively}} new approach to assemble nanoscale architectures, which can revolutionize the fabrication process and the materials used in ultra-densely integrated electronic devices. Of particular significance is the finding {{that it is possible to}} selectively <b>metallize</b> the flagella templates or flagella based templates to obtain electrical properties through interelement positioning at the nanometer scale [6, 7].

To stimulate advances in using flagella as bio-templates in these forward-looking fields, this article will examine three main sections. The first section explains the characteristics of bacterial flagella to highlight their attractive properties that can be exploited for nanofabrication. Next, this article will introduce current electronic devices, including DSSCs and LIBs, built using other bio-templates such as virus or diatom.
