5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> {{and these}} are enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. <b>Muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> may be beneficial.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{decreases}} {{the effects of}} the anticoagulant warfarin and of non-depolarizing <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> but increases the effect of depolarizing <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants.</b> It can also interfere with niacin (vitamin B3), resulting in at least one case to pellagra and fatal medullary aplasia. It has also been reported to cause vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E

40|$|The crude {{methanolic}} extract of {{the whole}} plant of Viola betonicifolia (VBME) was investigated for anxiolytic, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant,</b> sleep induction, antidepressant, and sedative activities) to ascertain its scientific values. VBME showed a significant (P< 0. 05) dose dependent anxiolytic action in staircase test. In <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> paradigms, a dose dependent muscle relaxation was observed. For phenobarbitone sleep induction test, VBME notably (P< 0. 05) reduced the latency time and increased total sleeping duration. Our tested extract was found free of any antidepressant activity, while the movement was significantly (P< 0. 05) shortened in locomotor activity. The whole plant of V. betonicifolia led to the isolation of 4 -hydroxyl coumarin (4 HC) which showed substantial safety profile in acute toxicity test. When challenged in Traction and Chimney tests, it showed significant (P< 0. 05) <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> effect in both <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> paradigms at 20 and 30 [*]mg/kg during various assessment times. Nevertheless, 4 HC was devoid of sedative and hypnotic potentials. In conclusion, VBME had strong <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> and sedative-hypnotic properties, while its isolated compound, 4 HC, possessed a significant <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> action with substantial safety profile without sedative-hypnotic effects...|$|R

25|$|Like all non-depolarising <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> pancuronium has {{no effect}} on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the {{anaesthetic}} used is insufficient, the individual may be awake but unable to cry out or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of anaesthetic in concert with normal dosages of <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> such as pancuronium.|$|E
