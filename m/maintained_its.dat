This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E

5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage.

Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
