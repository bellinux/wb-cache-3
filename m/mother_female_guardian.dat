Subjects were 198 first through third grade males and females enrolled in six primary schools in three urban, low socioeconomic areas of Khartoum. An interview form was developed to obtain information from the subjects 2 ̆ 7 <b>mothers</b> or <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> regarding demographic and living environment information, food behavior patterns, and common illnesses of their children. At school, anthropometric characteristics (weight and height) were measured, and school attendance and performance data were obtained;Most subjects came from large families but lived in small homes. Most parents had less than a high school education. The majority of fathers had relatively low-paying jobs and almost all of the mothers did not work outside the home. Most homes had piped water, electricity, television, and radios, but garbage removal services were not available to all the families. The children typically ate three meals and one or more snacks daily and consumed a variety of food items. Most children had had from two to five illnesses during the present school year, and illness was the major cause of absences from school. Anthropometric data indicated poor growth among this group of children. School records showed that a majority had first enrolled in school after age seven, but ranked in the top half of their class academically. Absenteeism averaged 2 - 4...|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV/AIDS {{represents}} a serious health threat in Jamaica. Adolescent and young adult females are at particularly high risk. US {{studies have shown}} that parent-teen sexual communication may significantly influence the sexual risk-related beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have examined parent-teen sexual communication in Jamaica or the wider Caribbean. Objective: The study aims to describe patterns of parent-teen sexual communication between Jamaican mothers and adolescent daughters and assess the psychometric properties of the Parent-Teen Sexual Risk Communication (PTSRC-III) scale when used with this population. Method: Data were collected {{as part of a larger}} randomized controlled trial study. A total of 330 urban Jamaican adolescent girls, ages 13 - 17, and their <b>mothers</b> or <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> completed the 8 -item PTSRC-III scale at baseline and 3 -month follow-up. Results: Mothers’ and daughters’ scores covered the full range of possible scores. Internal reliability of the PTSRC-III scale was excellent (α = 0. 92 and 0. 93 for mothers and daughters, respectively). There was evidence of consistency over time (r = 0. 57, p r = 0. 27, p r = 0. 427, p r = 0. 146, p = 0. 008). A two-factor structure was identified, although the second factor showed a lower eigen-value than was found in previous US studies. The loading pattern and explanation of variance were very similar to the factor 2 described in the initial psychometric testing of the PTSRC-III instrument. Discussion: Patterns of sexual communication and the psychometrics of the scale when used in Jamaica were consistent with US results, and provided evidence of the cross-cultural reliability and validity of the PTSRC-III scale...|$|R

The analysis focuses on how the HIV paediatric consultation is co-constructed between the doctor and the mother/guardian, and how interactional choices {{on the part of the}} participants shape the course of the consultation. Specific attention is placed on how participants orient to, hear, respond to and coconstruct the category of “mother”, along with the emergent inferences of what constitutes “good mothering” in the context of pursuing the wellbeing of the HIV-positive child who - as it emerges in certain cases - has evidently been infected by the mother in the first instance. As its core focus, this study examines how orienting to “good mothering” is done - in a moment-bymoment, collaborative and co-constructed manner – in the immediate course of the doctor/mother/guardian consultation. This involves considering the interplay of shifts in orientations to “motherly responsibility” and “doctorly responsibility”, and how these shifts are collaboratively activated, negotiated and responded to, as the consultation proceeds...|$|R

40|$|Adolescence {{is a time}} of {{heightened}} risk taking and vulnerability to social influence. Research has demonstrated the effects of social influence on adolescents’ risk taking; however, most research has focused on the effects of peer influence, with less known about the direct effects of parental influence on adolescent risk. The present study uses an experimental design to examine the effect of indirect and direct maternal and peer influence on adolescents’ risk taking on two behavioral tasks. Adolescent participants were recruited from Orange County, CA via flyer distribution and snowball sampling. Participants (N= 97) were eligible for the study if they spoke fluent English, aged 13 - 14 or 16 - 17 years, and had an English-speaking <b>mother</b> or <b>female</b> <b>guardian</b> and English-speaking friend of the same grade and gender who were willing to complete the study with the participant. Participants were randomly assigned to complete the study in one of four conditions: alone, with their friend, with their mother, or with both their friend and mother. Laboratory sessions were completed at the University of California, Irvine campus. Participants completed two behavioral tasks (one under conditions of indirect influence and one under conditions of direct influence) to assess the effects of maternal and peer influence on adolescent risk behavior, as well as a battery of self-report assessments. Although no effect of indirect maternal or peer influence was observed in the present analyses, results indicate that direct negative influence from mothers or friends increased adolescents’ risk taking. Adolescents in the mother-only and friend-only conditions took more risks than adolescents in the no influence condition; however, there were no differences in risk behavior when both the mother and friend were present. The effect of social influence on adolescent risk was consistent between the two age groups. Maternal hostility moderated the effect of direct influence on adolescents’ risk behavior, such that mothers who were perceived as more hostile had less influence over adolescents’ risk taking than mothers who were perceived as less hostile. These findings reveal that adolescents’ mothers and friends serve as highly influential figures and both have the capacity to increase adolescents’ engagement in risky behavior...|$|R

40|$|In {{early modern}} Spain, noble widows had both power and {{influence}} within their families. Widows who were guardians of their children exerted formal power over the lives, marriages, and property of their wards, and thus had direct control of many family decisions. Remarriage could complicate this power since Spanish law prohibited mothers from remarrying while they had guardianship {{of their children and}} most formal guardianship agreements specified that aristocratic women relinquish guardianship if they remarried. In spite of these prohibitions, aristocratic widows were valuable commodities on the marriage market and often faced family pressure to remarry. This conflict between guardianship and remarriage could create crises for women with loyalties to multiple families. Many <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> resolved these conflicts with a mixture of formal power and informal influence. Some aristocratic widows filed petitions with the Camara de Castilla to retain their guardianships after their second marriages. Other widows lost their guardianships but retained custody of their children and continued to sign marriage agreements, arrange dowries, and answer subpoenas. Often remarried <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> became part of a web of female influence that stretched to include grandmothers and aunts who could become guardians with or instead of the remarried mother. The formal petitions filed by <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> in the Camara de Castilla and property records, genealogies, marriage contracts, and guardianship agreements from the Osuna collection in the Seccin Nobleza of Archivo Historico Nacional Madrid and Toledo provide new insights into noble widows {{power and influence}} within the complex families created by their remarriages...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} perspectives on sex education {{in relation to}} sexual health of teenagers in Zambia. The research aimed at exploring the perspectives of various stakeholders (teenagers, parents, teachers, pastors and traditional counsellors) {{on the role of}} sex education to promote the sexual health of young people in Zambia. The study is guided by the theoretical perspectives of the sociology of childhood, which consider childhood as a social construct and children as social actors capable of constructing their own social lives and the lives of those around them. The rights based approach is also employed focusing on the protection rights, right to health and participation rights. The ecological system theory is also part of the study to explore how the interactions and relationships of different environments can affect the teaching of sex education. The study used qualitative research methods drawing 43 participants from Ndola district of Zambia. Methods used were body maps with 12 teenagers, focus group discussions with 32 teenagers and semi structured interviews with 12 teenagers, 4 parents, 2 teachers, 2 pastors and 2 traditional counsellors. Un structured observation was used as an accompaniment to all the three methods used in the study to capture the body language and culture behaviour exhibited by participants during data collection period. The study revealed that <b>mothers</b> or <b>female</b> <b>guardians</b> are more involved in sex education than fathers who are constrained with productive work and the culture aspect, which does not allow men to discuss sexual matters with especially their daughters as it was considered taboo. Other sources of information on sexuality for teenagers were the media, friends and school where they got more information, as the one from parents was more of the negative part of sex with emphasise on the effects of premarital sex such as pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Findings show that society was not comfortable with information coming from friends and the media as it might not give accurate information, thus they were more comfortable with the school to take up sex education. School was seen as a better place to capture a lot of teenagers, offer evidence based and correct harmful sexual practises {{such as the use of}} herbs by women to tighten vaginas and having multiple sexual partners as a way of gaining experience by men. However due to the influence of Christianity schools have put more emphasis on abstinence as the only way to avoid pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. On the other hand, tradition encourages boys to practise premarital sex to gain experience but both Christianity and tradition does not allow the use of contraceptives making it hard for the school and society to provide contraceptives to the young people. Nonavailability of contraceptives has disadvantaged young people who are sexually active putting their sexual health at risk. These findings have important implications for policy makers to try to implement measures on the teaching of sex education that will cater for needs of the young people including those who are already sexually active to try to improve the sexual health of teenagers in Zambia...|$|R
