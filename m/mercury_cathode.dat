Thermal desorption tests were applied on the finest size-sediment fractions at furnace temperatures between 300 degreesC and 400 degreesC and solids residence times between 3 minutes and 120 minutes. After 3 minutes at 400 degreesC, the treated sediment residue had a mercury content below the regulatory limit.

50|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} {{is possible}} in non-aqueous systems: In a system consisting of a molten metal in contact with molten salts, metals can be extracted from one phase to the other. This is related to a mercury electrode where a metal can be reduced, the metal will often then dissolve in the mercury to form an amalgam that modifies its electrochemistry greatly. For example, {{it is possible for}} sodium cations to be reduced at a <b>mercury</b> <b>cathode</b> to form sodium amalgam, while at an inert electrode (such as platinum) the sodium cations are not reduced. Instead, water is reduced to hydrogen. A detergent or fine solid can be used to stabilize an emulsion, or third phase.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium amalgam is a {{by-product}} of chlorine manufactured by mercury cell electrolysis. In this cell, brine (concentrated sodium chloride solution) is electrolysed between a liquid <b>mercury</b> <b>cathode</b> and a titanium or graphite anode. Chlorine is formed at the anode, while sodium formed at the cathode dissolves into the mercury, making sodium amalgam. Normally this sodium amalgam is drawn off and reacted with water in a [...] "decomposer cell" [...] to produce hydrogen gas, concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, and mercury to be recycled through the process. In principle, all the mercury should be completely recycled, but inevitably a small portion goes missing.

Tubes {{were made of}} Pyrex or quartz and had <b>cathodes</b> of <b>mercury</b> or nickel. Work was first done with mercury tubes at low pressures. Later, tubes were made having nickel cathodes and filled with argon. Tubes were tested to see at what voltage they discharged spontaneously one hence {{if they could be}} used with the 20, 000 V power supply available. A 2500 V power supply was obtained for use with low voltage tubes. An integrating light output meter was constructed for measuring the light output of the tubes.

Fine fibres were set up and illuminated in a manner reproducing conditions of cloud tracks in an expansion chamber.

He noted that while these amalgams oxidated in only a few minutes when exposed to air they could be preserved for lengthy periods of time when submerged in naphtha before becoming covered with a white crust.On 30 June 1808 Davy reported to the Royal Society that he had successfully isolated four new metals which he named barium, calcium, strontium and magnium (later changed to magnesium) which were subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions.

The sources of the impurities were sought using the techniques of SIMS, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry to analyse {{the components of the}} plating bath solution (cadmium sulphate, Milli-Q water, sulphuric acid, tellurium anode, glass/ITO/CdS-cathode, reference electrodes) and the solution containers. Six different supplies of 3 CdSO 4 - 8 H 2 O were investigated. Each had at least twelve impurities totalling over 61 μg/g. Sulphuric acid (pH= 2) leached more impurities from vessels made from Duran-Schott glass or Corning Pyrex glass than from vessels made from Teflon or Vitreosil silica. Milli-Q water and the platinum or <b>mercury</b> <b>cathodes</b> used in the electrodeposition step were not seen {{to be a source of}} impurities, but the ITO/CdS slide used for the CdTe deposition was. Electropurification of the solution before injection of Te ions from the Te anode removed Cr, Fe, Cu, Ag, Tl, Pb and Bi. However, injection of Te ions before electrodeposition introduced impurities, notably B, Mg, Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu and In. Each impurity in the CdTe films was present in the deposition chemicals or leached from the materials in contact with these chemicals. It is concluded that CdTe film purity may be enhanced by judicious choice of deposition materials and procedure; as well, some of the analytical data presented in this paper should be useful in other areas of research where ultra-purity is required...|$|R

The results also indicate the existence of a very dense plasma (10 to the 10 th to 10 to the 14 th electrons/cu cm) with steep electron density gradients in the region upstream of the orifice. The upstream data is found to correlate well with a modified form of the Saha equation.

Magnetic field strength at the neutralizer cathode orifice is a crucial factor influencing the coupling voltage.
