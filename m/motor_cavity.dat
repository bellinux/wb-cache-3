The solution yields the natural circular frequencies of vibration and the corresponding acoustic pressure mode shapes, considering the coupled response of the propellant grain to the acoustic oscillations occurring in the <b>motor</b> <b>cavity.</b> The near incompressibility of the solid propellant is {{taken into account in}} the formulation.

40|$|A {{methodology}} is outlined {{for predicting}} the amplitude of forced vibrations in the acoustic cavity {{of a solid}} rocket motor. The equation for forced vibration of the <b>motor</b> <b>cavity</b> acoustic system is written by parallel with the acoustic mechanical analogy. Acoustic and aeroacoustic theory are used to predict the frequency and intensity of vortex systems or turbulence created by passage of the mean flow over geometric discontinuities in the motor port. Approximate methods are presented for coupling the acoustic field due to the flow noise with the chamber acoustics and for summing the effect upon the multiple acoustic modes...|$|E

Particle size was determined using light scattering techniques. The present optical components limit the lower measurable particle size to approximately three microns. During the investigation, spurious light was detected in the motor optical path. It was determined that transient pressure gradients in the motor during motor pressure rise resulted in deflection of the laser beam. Neutral burning propellant grains were shown to eliminate most of the observed difficulty. The use of a ring array {{in place of the}} linear array in the <b>motor</b> <b>cavity</b> measurement system is suggested for system improvement. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

The optical quality was determined with a classical flux-mapping using a lambertian target and a CCD camera system, which also leads to the energy input to the PCU. For the thermodynamic analysis all the data necessary for a complete energy balance around the Stirling engine, i. e. efficiency of the Stirling <b>motor,</b> the <b>cavity</b> and the receiver {{as well as the}} parasitic losses were measured.

40|$|A {{series of}} rocket motor firings was {{performed}} in a modified linear aerospike thrust chamber with the H 2 /O 2 propellant combination to allow determination of the physical properties of the combustion gases in acoustic cavities located in the chamber side walls. A preliminary analytical study was first conducted to define theoretically both the appropriate cavity dimensions and the combustion gas flow field adjacent to the cavity openings. During the subsequent <b>motor</b> firings, <b>cavity</b> gas temperature profiles were measured and gas samples were withdrawn {{from the bottom of}} the cavities for compositional analysis by measurement of pressure/temperature variation and gas chromatography. Data were obtained with both radially and axially oriented cavities and with and without hydrogen bleed flow through the cavities. A simplified procedure was developed for predicting gas cavity and acoustic velocity for use in acoustic cavity design analyses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} and {{development}} of solid propellant rocket motors (SRMs), the use of numerical tools able to simulate, predict and reconstruct {{the behavior of a}} given motor in all its operative conditions is particularly important in order to decrease all the planning times and costs. An objective in this field of the space propulsion can be, hence, to develop an analysis/simulation capability of SRM internal ballistic for the entire combustion time. The core of the numerical simulation capability utilized in this paper is represented by the SPINBALL model and numerical code. SPINBALL core model is a quasi- 1 D unsteady gasdynamics model of the internal ballistic, with source terms that take into account the contribution to the bore flowfield conditions due to the igniter, the grain propellant and <b>motor</b> <b>cavities.</b> The grain burning surface evolution model is represented by a 3 D numerical grain regression model (GREG) based on a full matrix level set approach, on both rectangular and cylindrical structured grids. The numerical tool can be used both for the prediction and the reconstruction of SRM internal ballistics. In the reconstruction phase, in order to take into account for the internal ballistics non-ideal parameters and the nozzle throat area evolution, a 0 D quasi steady model of SRM internal ballistic has been developed. It uses, as input, the experimental data from static firing tests (SFTs), to evaluate the combustion efficiency, hump law, nozzle efficiency and nozzle throat area evolution. Results will be shown for one of the solid rocket motors developed in the ESA project of the new European small launcher Vega. The SPINBALL model, in fact, will be used for the reconstruction of the P 80 FW QM (Qualification Motor) and DM (Development Motor) SFTs. The use of the non-ideal parameters, coming from the 0 D SFT numer- ical reconstruction model, within the Q 1 D model will be analyzed in order to underline the effects of the increased simulation capability on the SFTs reconstruction...|$|R

A procedure is developed to allow comparison of one and three dimensional models by averaging over the cross section of the <b>motor</b> <b>cavity.</b> Results indicate that the one dimensional equations with mass addition do not contain any physical phenomena that are missing the three dimensional equations with appropriate boundary conditions. This raises significant questions about any procedure that is based on the difference between one and three dimensional results...|$|E
40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (stator, pump, suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the piston block and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a <b>motor</b> <b>cavity</b> in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>cavity.</b> The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the <b>motor</b> <b>cavity.</b> The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.

40|$|Space Shuttle {{solid rocket}} motor low {{frequency}} internal pressure oscillations {{have been observed}} since early testing. The same type of oscillations also {{are present in the}} redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM). The oscillations, which occur during RSRM burn, are predominantly at the first three <b>motor</b> <b>cavity</b> longitudinal acoustic mode frequencies. Broadband flow and combustion noise provide the energy to excite these modes at low levels throughout motor burn, however, at certain times during burn the fluctuating pressure amplitude increases significantly. The increased fluctuations at these times suggests an additional excitation mechanism. The RSRM has inhibitors on the propellant forward facing surface of each motor segment. The inhibitors are in a slot at the segment field joints to prevent burning at that surface. The aft facing segment surface at a field joint slot burns and forms a cavity of time varying size. Initially the inhibitor is recessed in the field joint cavity. As propellant burns away the inhibitor begins to protrude into the bore flow. Two mechanisms (transit time models) that are considered potential pressure oscillation excitations are cavity-edge tones, and inhibitor hole-tones. Estimates of frequency variation with time of longitudinal acoustic modes, cavity edge-tones, and hole-tones compare favorably with frequencies measured during motor hot firing. It is believed that the highest oscillation amplitudes occur when vortex shedding frequencies coincide with motor longitudinal acoustic modes. A time accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was made to replicate the observations from motor firings and to observe the transit time mechanisms in detail. FDNS is the flow solver used to detail the time varying aspects of the flow. The fluid is approximated as a single-phase ideal gas. The CFD model was an axisymmetric representation of the RSRM at 80 seconds into burn. Deformation of the inhibitors by the internal flow was determined through an iterative structural and CFD analysis. The analysis domain ended just upstream of the nozzle throat. This is an acoustic boundary condition that caused the motor to behave as a closed-open organ pipe. This differs from the RSRM which behaves like a closed-closed organ pipe. The unsteady CFD solution shows RSRM chamber pressure oscillations predominately at the longitudinal acoustic mode frequencies of a closed-open organ pipe. Vortex shedding in the joint cavities and at the inhibitors contribute disturbances to the flow at the second longitudinal acoustic mode frequency. Further studies are planned using an analysis domain that extends downstream of the nozzle throat...|$|E
40|$|A coaxial blade tuner {{has been}} {{selected}} for the 1. 3 GHz SRF cavities of the Fermilab SRF Accelerator Test Facility. Results from tuner cold tests in the Fermilab Horizontal Test Stand are presented. Fermilab is constructing the SRF Accelerator Test Facility, a facility for accelerator physics research and development. This facility will contain {{a total of six}} cryomodules, each containing eight 1. 3 GHz nine-cell elliptical cavities. Each cavity will be equipped with a Slim Blade Tuner designed by INFN Milan. The blade tuner incorporates both a stepper motor and piezo actuators to allow for both slow and fast cavity tuning. The stepper <b>motor</b> allows the <b>cavity</b> frequency to be statically tuned over a range of 500 kHz with an accuracy of several Hz. The piezos provide up to 2 kHz of dynamic tuning for compensation of Lorentz force detuning and variations in the He bath pressure.

40|$|Abstract Keyword(s) : {{deep brain}} stimulation, LFP, {{pathologic}} brain <b>cavity,</b> <b>motor</b> cortex 1. 1 	Introduction Pathologic brain cavities, often caused by e. g. stroke, {{are associated with}} disrupted neural circuitries. Symptoms are caused {{not only by the}} loss of neurons, but also by the disruption of neural networks. Since deep brain stimulation (DBS) emerged as a last-resort treatment for patients with Parkinson’s disease [1], it has been implemented for many indications [2 - 4]. We now propose an entirely new and unexplored application where electrode contacts are implanted directly against the wall of a pathologic brain cavity. This approach allows us to interact directly with the neurons of the disrupted circuitries by listening to their electrical activity (by recording local field potentials, LFPs) and by electrically stimulating them 1. 2 	Methods We developed miniature thin-film electrode arrays consisting of a matrix of 16 or 38 platinum contacts, designed to be flexible enough to conform to the pathological brain cavity wall. We implanted these electrodes against the wall of a pathologic brain cavity in the primary motor cortex of 20 rats. We recorded LFPs with all electrode contacts from the cavity wall while rats were performing behavioral tests. In a second stage, we electrically stimulated the cavity wall thereby aiming to improve the motor symptoms. Rats were tested with several sets of stimulation parameters (cathodic biphasic stimulation with all contacts, 100 Hz, 210 µs) in a randomized and blinded crossover experiment. 1. 3 	Results Based on spectral feature exploration, we obtained strong evidence that the theta power band (6 - 10 Hz) and the gamma band (45 - 90 Hz) are correlated to an active, engaged movement state. In all animals, electrical stimulation of the cavity wall at supra-optimal amplitudes induced visible side effects, such as clonic behavior and seizures. Furthermore, this behavior was often limited to the lesioned limb only. No improvement of motor function at the optimal amplitude was observed. 1. 4 	Conclusion Some frequency bands were correlated to movement of the rat, confirming results in healthy rats and other studies exploring the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus. In the future, we aim to use LFPs to guide us to the best place for stimulation, or for driving a closed-loop stimulation algorithm. status: publishe...|$|R
