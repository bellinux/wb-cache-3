40|$|This thesis {{proposed}} and demonstrated a flat-spectral response Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) in Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI). The response exhibits a flat spectral of approximately 0. 5 nm with a crosstalk level of round - 3 dB. The high crosstalk {{is due to}} the phase errors as a result of fabrication tolerance and errors. Two main errors were identified. Firstly, the systematic errors of waveguide rib width and etched depth and secondly, the random variation of photomask resolution which was subjected to fabrication equipment in Southampton University. These errors have been investigated and the observations of the analysis were consistent with the experimental result. The AWG is designed to operate at a centre wavelength of 1. 55 mum at a grating order of 52 with path length differences of 23. 62 mum. The rib waveguides of the array are designed to operate as singlemode waveguides and to exhibit <b>minimum</b> <b>polarisation</b> dependence. As this thesis is to proof of principle, additional optimisation of the AWG is not carried out. The main ideology of the design method is to introduce free carriers to parts of the waveguides across the grating arms to induce absorption. This will modify the shape the field distribution across the array waveguides from a Gaussian to a SINC function. By applying Fourier optics to the free space region of the AWG, this field profile is the inverse Fourier transforms of the required output field of the AWG, which is the flat spectral response. This method gives the robustness of tailoring the optical field distribution across the AWs by the appropriate choice of net doping concentration, and hence gives room for design flexibility without increasing the physical dimension of the AWG significantly. The potential of achieving a smaller SOI AWG device with the use of higher net dosage and the realisation of achieving a uniform doping concentration through multiple implantations has been discussed.

40|$|PoGOLite is a balloon-borne hard X-ray {{polarimeter}} {{dedicated to}} the study of point sources. Compton scattered events are registered using an array of plastic scintillator units to determine the polarisation of incident X-rays in the energy range 20 - 240 keV. In 2013, a near circumpolar balloon flight of 14 days duration was completed after launch from Esrange, Sweden, resulting in a measurement of the linear polarisation of the Crab emission. Building on the experience gained from this Pathfinder flight, the polarimeter is being modified to improve performance for a second flight in 2016. Such optimisations, based on Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulations, take into account the source characteristics, the instrument response and the background environment which is dominated by atmospheric neutrons. This paper describes the optimisation of the polarimeter and details the associated increase in performance. The resulting design, PoGO+, is expected to improve the <b>Minimum</b> Detectable <b>Polarisation</b> (MDP) for the Crab from 19. 8...|$|R
40|$|Polarimetric {{observations}} of celestial {{sources in the}} hard X-ray band stand to provide new information on emission mechanisms and source geometries. PoGO+ is a Compton scattering polarimeter (20 - 150 keV) optimised for the observation of the Crab (pulsar and wind nebula) and Cygnus X- 1 (black hole binary), from a stratospheric balloon-borne platform launched from the Esrange Space Centre in summer 2016. Prior to flight, {{the response of the}} polarimeter has been studied with polarised and unpolarised X-rays allowing a Geant 4 -based simulation model to be validated. The expected modulation factor for Crab observations is found to be M_Crab=(41. 75 ± 0. 85) %, resulting in an expected <b>Minimum</b> Detectable <b>Polarisation</b> (MDP) of 7. 3 % for a 7 day flight. This will allow a measurement of the Crab polarisation parameters with at least 5 σ statistical significance assuming a polarisation fraction ∼ 20 % - a significant improvement over the PoGOLite Pathfinder mission which flew in 2013 and from which the PoGO+ design is developed.

40|$|In the 50 {{years since}} the advent of X-ray {{astronomy}} there have been many scientific advances due to the development of new experimental techniques for detecting and characterising X-rays. Observations of X-ray polarisation have, however, not undergone a similar development. This is a shortcoming since a plethora of open questions related to the nature of X-ray sources could be resolved through measurements of the linear polarisation of emitted X-rays. The PoGOLite Pathfinder is a balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimeter operating in the 25 - 240 keV energy band from a stabilised observation platform. Polarisation is determined using coincident energy deposits in a segmented array of plastic scintillators surrounded by a BGO anticoincidence system and a polyethylene neutron shield. The PoGOLite Pathfinder was launched from the SSC Esrange Space Centre in July 2013. A near-circumpolar flight was achieved with a duration of approximately two weeks. The flight performance of the Pathfinder design is discussed for the three Crab observations conducted. The signal-to-background ratio for the observations is shown to be 0. 25 ± 0. 03 and the <b>Minimum</b> Detectable <b>Polarisation</b> (99...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Polarimetry {{is an area}} of {{high energy}} {{astrophysics}} which is still relatively unexplored, even though it is recognized that this type of measurement could drastically increase our knowledge of the physics and geometry of high energy sources. For this reason, {{in the context of the}} design of a Gamma-Ray Imager based on new hard-X and soft gamma ray focusing optics for the next ESA Cosmic Vision call for proposals (Cosmic Vision 2015 - 2025), it is important that this capability should be implemented in the principal on-board instrumentation. For the particular case of wide band-pass Laue optics we propose a focal plane based on a thick pixelated CdTe detector operating with high efficiency between 60 – 600 keV. The high segmentation of this type of detector (1 – 2 mm pixel size) and the good energy resolution (a few keV FWHM at 500 keV) will allow high sensitivity polarisation measurements (a few % for a 10 mCrab source in 106 s) to be performed. We have evaluated the modulation Q factors and <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>polarisation</b> through the use of Monte Carlo simulations (based on the GEANT 4 toolkit) for on and off-axis sources with power law emission spectra using the point spread function of a Laue lens in a feasible configuration.

40|$|Astrophysical X-ray {{polarimetry}} {{remains as}} unexplored {{now as it}} was 30 years ago. Narrow bandwidth or low scattering efficiency in current technologies have rendered polarisation observations insensitive to all but the brightest sources. Consequently only one unambiguous measurement of polarisation in a cosmic X-ray source {{has been made to}} date: that of 19 % linear polarisation at 2. 6 keV for the Crab nebula. The very large effective area of the International X-ray Observatory compared to that of previous observatories opens the possibility of the first new results in astronomical X-ray polarimetry for over three decades. We describe a simple, low-mass X-ray filter technology which can add polarimetry capability to the existing Narrow Field Imager. We summarise results from our current laboratory proof-of-concept studies, provide estimates of the <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>polarisation</b> for a selection of sources and discuss the astrophysical observations that could be made by IXO using this device. Principle The distribution of electronic states in an X-ray dichroic material is different in the two principal axes of the crystal, so that the X-ray absorption properties differ according to the orientation of the electric field vector in a beam of polarised X-rays. Crystals which possess this directionality act like X-ray “Polaroid®”. They can be engineered by adopting a host-guest structure (a) in which the bonds of the “active ” material are forced into alignment by being held in place within a tunnel-like “host ” matrix. An alternative approach (b) uses complex coordination chemistry to generate crystals with high degrees of alignment. Both approaches are used in our work...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{polarisation}} measurement is {{a unique}} tool which may provide crucial information regarding the emission mechanism and the geometry of various astrophysical sources, like neutron stars, accreting black holes, pulsar wind nebulae, AGNs, Supernova Remnants etc. and can help us to probe matter under extreme magnetic fields and extreme gravitational fields. Although the three other domains of X-ray Astronomy i. e. timing, spectral and imaging are well developed, there has been very little progress in X-ray Polarimetry with only one definitive polarisation measurement and a few upper limits available so far. Radiation from accreting black holes in their thermal dominated (High Soft) state {{is expected to be}} polarised due to scattering in the plane parallel atmosphere of the disk. Also, special and general relativistic effects in the innermost parts of the disk predicts energy dependent rotation in the plane of polarisation and some distinct signatures which {{can be used as a}} probe for measuring the parameters of the black hole like its spin, emissivity profile and the angle of inclination of the system. We present the results from an analysis of expected <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>polarisation</b> from some of the galactic black hole binaries GRO J 1655 - 40, GX 339 - 4, H 1743 - 322, Cyg X- 1 and XTE J 1817 - 330 in their thermal dominated state with a proposed Thomson X-ray Polarimeter. A proposal for a scattering polarimeter has been submitted to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for a dedicated small satellite mission and a laboratory unit has been built. Along with the measurement of the degree of polarisation, the polarisation angle measurement is also important, hence the error in the polarisation angle measurement for a range of detection significance is also obtained.
