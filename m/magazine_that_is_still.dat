500|$|There is a {{documented}} {{controversy about}} {{the location and}} names of the Civil War fortifications at Randolph, Fort Wright and Fort Randolph. A publication dated 1868 mentions Fort Wright and claims that it was formerly named Fort Pillow and was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff, the author treats Fort Randolph as a separate fortification on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The known location of Fort Pillow [...] {{and the location of}} Randolph [...] are about [...] apart. A recent publication dated 2009 suggests that only one fortification existed at Randolph which was first named Fort Randolph and later became known as Fort Wright. Different sources give different locations for both fortifications. The Tipton County Property Assessor's Interactive Mapping System provides the location [...] for the parcel ID 084055 02500, named [...] "Fort Wright Historical". This is also the location of the powder <b>magazine</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> intact as of 2008. [...] For Fort Randolph, other sources give the location , the exact locations provided for Fort Randolph differ from each other due to rounding after the fifth decimal place of the coordinates. The two locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph are about [...] apart.|$|E

Longford regularly condemned the media for [...] "manipulating" [...] West and feeding her desire for revenge, being particularly critical of The Sun newspaper for its [...] "exploitation" [...] of West — referring to her numerous television and newspaper interviews in which she argued against any suggestion of Hindley ever being paroled, often threatening to kill her if she was ever set free. In 1986, Longford reportedly told West that unless she forgave Hindley and Brady, she would not go to Heaven when she died. He also commented <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> [...] "tremendously sorry for her, but letting her decide Myra's fate would be ludicrous".|$|R

5000|$|The Campana Company was {{incorporated}} in Illinois in 1927. Its first product was Italian Balm, a hand lotion. The formula was purchased from a Dr. Campana, {{from where the}} company derives its name. Although the company first operated only {{two years before the}} start of The Great Depression, it was initially very prosperous due to innovative advertising promoted by its owner, Ernest Morgan Oswalt. Campana {{was one of the first}} companies to offer free cosmetics samples in <b>magazines,</b> a method <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> extensively used. A second method of advertising was the use of radio commercials. Oswalt hired writer Florence Ward to create a radio variety show that would feature commercials for the company. The show, The First Nighter Program, was very successful and ran for 22 years. The company's treasurer and Oswalt's nephew, I. Willard Crull, would write over a hundred radio plays for the program under the pen name Anthony Wayne. Due in part to these commercials, Italian Balm became one of the best-selling hand lotions in the United States. Spinoffs from First Nighter also included Grand Hotel. Campana sponsored First Nighter also premiered on ABC Television's prime time schedule in 1950. Its Wednesday night time slot was eight p.m., which had it competing against NBC's Four Star Revue and CBS's Arthur Godfrey and His Friends (a program that had already [...] "shot to the top of the TV ratings and stayed there for several years").|$|R

Various media outlets had reported <b>that</b> the recording <b>was</b> {{to be the first}} single from Eminem's 2009 album Relapse, however the Italian branch of Universal Music Group, owner of Interscope Records, later denied this, stating that [...] "Crack a Bottle" [...] was only a promotional recording. Despite all this, the song was released on February 2, 2009, and made available for paid digital download, with 50 Cent stating that the song will be included on his upcoming album Before I Self Destruct. According to Danielle Harling of HipHopDX—a website dedicated to hip hop music coverage—the song will ultimately be present on both Relapse and Before I Self Destruct, while in contrast, Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone <b>Magazine</b> stated <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> unsure which rapper will feature this song on his upcoming album. Despite the confusion, Universal eventually announced that [...] "Crack a Bottle" [...] will be included in Relapse, although it does not consider it the album's first single. The song samples [...] "Mais dans la lumière" [...] by Mike Brant, written by Jean Renard, who also received songwriting credits for the song. The same sample is used in the song Preservation by Aesop Rock and Del tha Funkee Homosapien, found on Wu-Tang Clan's 2005 album Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture. The song is in the key of C-sharp minor. American rapper Jay Rock released a remix to the song. Rappers Cashis and Bobby Creekwater were featured in the official remix of [...] "Crack a Bottle".

5000|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} album 65 out of 100 based on 14 {{generally}} favorable reviews. For {{his review of}} Just Push Play for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> their best album since Pump in 1989, but he criticized them [...] "for not acting their age" [...] and said the album was not much compared to Pump and Permanent Vacation. He compared their production name, [...] "The Boneyard Boys", to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' production name, [...] "The Glimmer Twins." [...] Ben Mitchell of Blender magazine said the album was better than Nine Lives by {{a little bit and}} feels the album was not with the times and was rather poor. Darryl Stredan had a very strong dislike for both the album and the artist saying <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> not a band anymore, <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> instead a marketing company, and was of the opinion that they should stop producing new music. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that songs to not listen to on the album are [...] "Fly Away from Here", [...] "Luv Lies", [...] "Avant Garden", [...] "Just Push Play", [...] "Drop Dead Gorgeous", and [...] "Outta Your Head", {{but the rest of the}} songs on the album are tolerable including several with string sections ("Jaded", [...] "Beyond Beautiful", and [...] "Sunshine") and thinks the album overall is good but not great. In the NME magazine review of Just Push Play said that most of the album is not new, but the album was Aerosmith's first album to feature rap metal with songs like [...] "Just Push Play" [...] & [...] "Outta Your Head". David Fricke of Rolling Stone <b>magazine</b> said <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> a good band and it is lucky for them to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> around, but he also said that they had not made a [...] "great album" [...] since Rocks, although it came close as did Pump. He compared [...] "Jaded" [...] to an Electric Light Orchestra song and said that the weak spots on the album were the power ballads. Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "Jaded", as a choice cut.|$|R
