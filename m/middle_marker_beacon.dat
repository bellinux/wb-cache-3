50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{specialized}} beacon used in aviation {{in conjunction with}} an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased-out and most new ILS installations have no <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

50|$|On some installations, <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{operating}} at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is received it activates an indicator on the pilot's instrument panel and {{the tone of}} the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is published in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glide slope. In modern ILS installations, a DME is installed, co-located with the ILS, to augment or replace <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> A DME continuously displays the aircraft's distance to the runway.|$|R

50|$|The AN/MRN-3 was a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> set {{used by the}} Army Air Force {{during and}} after World War II, it was {{standardized}} 23 October 1943, and replaced SCR-241.|$|R
5000|$|FuBL 1 Used the Lorenz {{landing beam}} system. Consisted of the EBL 1 and EBL 2 {{receivers}} with display device ANF 2. The EBL 1 operated between 30 and 33 MHz {{and received the}} azimuth signals from a transmitter {{at the far end}} of the runway, The EBL 2 operated at 38 MHz and received the two <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> as the aircraft approached the threshold to land. The AFN 2 provided the pilot with a left/right display and a signal strength. The pilot could also hear the azimuth signal and the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> in his headset. When the aircraft passed over the beacons a light was also illuminated in the cockpit.` ...|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found the cause to be pilot error by the captain. Failure to receive the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> signal (probably due to a fault that had developed in the receiver) was a contributory factor.|$|R
50|$|According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{is defined}} as A {{transmitter}} in the aeronautical radionavigation service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{particular}} type of VHF radio beacon used in aviation, usually in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine position along an established route to a destination such as a runway.|$|R
50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
5000|$|The LOM is {{becoming}} less important now that GPS navigation {{is well established}} in the aviation community. [...] Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> completely, replacing the outer marker with a non-directional beacon (NDB); and, more recently, with GPS fixes.|$|R
50|$|Each system {{requires}} three <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> sets, one to {{be located}} in the airport runway boundary, one at approximately one mile from the approach end of the runway, and one 4.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, all on the center line of the runway to be used. The equipment transmits a vertical pattern to be received by the RC-43, RC-193, or AN/ARN-8, AN/ARN-12. A signal, amplitude modulated at 1,300 cycles per second, may be keyed at two dashes per second, six dots per second, or may be unkeyed. The <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter projects a vertical fan-shaped pattern to a height of approximately 3,000 feet. The transmitter is placed so that the longer horizontal axis is perpendicular to the line of approach.|$|R
50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R
40|$|Kemmer (1993) {{argues that}} <b>middle</b> voice <b>markers</b> almost always arise diachronically through the {{semantic}} extension of a reflexive marker to other semantic uses related to reflexive. In this paper I will argue {{for an alternative}} diachronic path {{that has led to}} the development of the <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> in Yurakaré (unclassified, Bolivia) : through ideophone-verb constructions. Taking this perspective helps explain a number of synchronic peculiarities of the <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> in Yurakaré, and it introduces a previously unnoticed channel for <b>middle</b> voice <b>markers</b> to arise...|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
50|$|A <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to 0.8 nmi km before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the <b>middle</b> <b>marker,</b> the receiver's amber <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> light starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I missed approach point (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|R
5000|$|A {{back course}} marker (BC) {{normally}} indicates the ILS back course {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en route marker.|$|R
5000|$|NDBs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used as markers or [...] "locators" [...] for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a standard terminal arrival procedure, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> in the ILS approach (called a locator outer marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with DME ranges used instead to delineate the different segments of the approach. German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100 kHz to 1500 kHz with a power of 150 W. It was used to send the submarine's location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft use DME to {{determine}} their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs - two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, markers were used {{extensively}} along airways {{to provide an}} indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> increasingly obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some older}} <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receivers, {{instead of the}} [...] "O", [...] "M" [...] and [...] "I" [...] {{indicators}} (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled [...] "A" [...] (or FM/Z), [...] "O" [...] and [...] "M" [...] (airway or Fan and Z <b>marker,</b> outer, <b>middle).</b> The airway <b>marker</b> was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete [...] "Red" [...] airways; this was sometimes a [...] "fan" [...] marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A [...] "Z" [...] marker was sometimes located at low/medium frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage. As airway beacons used the same 3,000 Hz audio frequency as the inner marker, the [...] "A" [...] indicator on older receivers {{can be used to}} detect the inner marker.|$|R
50|$|The VAR bridged the {{technological}} {{gap between the}} Low-Frequency Radio Range (LFR) radio navigation system and the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation system. VAR provided four courses for navigation, two using visual instrument signals functionally and technically similar to the modern localizer and backbeam components used in the ILS system and two using audio signals similar to the LFR system. VAR also used <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> similar to the ILS.|$|R
50|$|The RC-43-A (BC-357) is a UHF {{receiver}} {{which provides}} a visual indication when flying over a 75-MHz <b>marker</b> <b>beacon.</b> it operates {{in the frequency of}} 67 to 80 MHz. The receiver box is located with other radio equipment and lights a lamp on the pilot's instrument panel when over the beacon. the RC-43 is 24 volts, the RC-39 is 12 volts. the unit uses a fixed wire antenna.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the outer}} and middle markers; located at the {{beginning}} (threshold) of the runway on some ILS approach systems (usually Category II and III) having decision heights of less than 200 ft AGL. Triggers a flashing white light on the same <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver used for the outer and middle markers; also a series of audio tone 'dots' at a frequency of 3,000 Hz in the headset.|$|R
5000|$|A master's thesis {{research}} {{work of a}} native speaker of Burushaski: Middle Voice Construction in Burushaski: From the Perspective of a Native Speaker of the Hunza Dialect claims that the dd- verbal prefix is an overt morphological <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> for MV constructions, while the n- verbal prefixis a morphological marker for passive voice. The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena {{can be observed in}} otherdialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> (MM) means the grammatical device used to “indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity” (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example ...|$|R

These autopilot-in-the-loop flight tests using GPS Integrity <b>Beacons</b> (low-power, ground-based <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> pseudolites placed under the approach path) furnished evidence that GPS can provide the full performance necessary to meet the stringent specifications of Category III. The built-in geometrical redundancy provided by Integrity Beacon ranging is coupled with centimeter-level accuracy to provide the system integrity. This integrity-calculated {{to be better than}} one part in a billion probability of missed detection-is achieved independently from ground-based monitors using receiver autonomous integrity monitoring @AIM) ...|$|R
50|$|Approach {{lighting}} systems {{are designed to}} allow the pilot to quickly and positively identify visibility distances in Instrument meteorological conditions. For example, if the aircraft is at the <b>middle</b> <b>marker,</b> and the <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> is located 3600 feet from the threshold, the Decision Bar is 2600 feet ahead. If the procedure calls for {{at least half a}} statute mile flight visibility (roughly 2600 feet), spotting the Decision Bar at the marker would indicate enough flight visibility to continue the procedure. In addition, the shorter bars before and after the Decision Bar are spaced either 100 feet or 200 feet apart, depending on the ALS type. The number of short bars the pilot can see can be used to determine flight visibility. Approaches with lower minimums use the more precise 100-foot spacing systems for more accurate identification of visibility.|$|R
50|$|Using VNsight imagery {{blended with}} the {{standard}} M-PNVS forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery, pilots can see lighting that was previously unviewable in low-light conditions. This includes lasers, <b>markers,</b> <b>beacons,</b> and tracer rounds, which were not accurately registered with the thermal image over the full sensor field of view. The VNsight upgrade ensures safer flying conditions and enhanced mission capability (especially in urban environments) by improving situation awareness in low-light-level conditions and situations where existing light sources cannot be imaged by the FLIR. It also allows the aircrew to see their own laser spot while designating targets for laser guided munition engagements, providing an extra level of certainty that the correct target and aim-point are designated. Enhanced air-to-ground communication reduces the potential for blue on blue incidents.|$|R
50|$|Two small <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{were also}} used: one 300 m {{off the end}} of runway, the HEZ (Haupteinflugzeichen), and another 3 km away, the VEZ (Voreinflugzeichen), both were {{broadcast}} on 38 MHz and modulated at 1700 and 700 Hz, respectively. These signals were broadcast directly upward, and would be heard briefly as the aircraft flew over them. To approach the runway, the pilot would fly to a published altitude and then use the main directional signals to line up with the runway and started flying toward it. When he flew over the VEZ he would start descending on a standard glide slope, continuing to land or abort at the HEZ depending on whether or not he could see the runway.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., LOMs are {{identified}} by two-letter Morse code modulated at 1020 Hz. LOMs use {{the first two}} letters of the parent ILS's identification. For example, at New York's JFK runway 31R the ILS identifier is I-RTH and the LOM ident is RT. If this facility were a locator <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> (LMM) its identifier {{would be the last}} two letters, TH.|$|R
