50|$|While {{working at}} the {{excavation}} site, Vyatkin found {{one of the most}} important astronomical instruments used at the observatory: a large arch that had been used to determine midday. A trench of about 2 metres wide was dug in a hill along the line of the Meridian and in it was placed the arc of the instrument. Today, there is a circular base showing the outline of the original structure and the doorway leads to the remaining underground section of the Fakhrī sextant that is now roofed over. The sextant was 11 metres long and once rose to the top of the surrounding 3 storey structure although it was kept underground to protect it from earthquakes. Calibrated along its length, it was the world's largest 90 degree quadrant at the time, with a radius of 40.4 metres. The radius of the meridian arc was according to a trusted middle age Turkish astronomer approximately 50 metres and was said to be the same height as the dome of the Hagia Sofia mosque in Istanbul. It was used for the observation of the Sun, Moon and other celestial bodies, and along with other sophisticated equipment such as an armillary and an astrolabe, the astronomers working in Samarkand could determine noon every day according to the <b>meridional</b> <b>height</b> of the Sun, distance from the zenith and declination.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{changes of}} the thermohaline {{circulation}} (THC) are likely to cause abrupt climate change. Here we intend to find a simple measure to detect changes in THC through examining several factors proposed to con-trol the THC variations using a coupled climate model. These factors are Equatorial-South Atlantic upper ocean temperature, Southern Ocean freshening, inter-basin sea surface salinity contrast, and <b>meridional</b> steric <b>height</b> gra-dient. Three experiments are analyzed – a present-day control run, a freshwater hosing run and a 1 % CO 2 run. Results show that if freshwater flux is the primary cause, all examined factors can predict the THC changes. If both thermal and haline forcings are involved, only the Atlantic <b>meridional</b> steric <b>height</b> gradient gives a con-sistent measure of the THC variations. A new result presented {{here is that the}} inter-basin sea surface temper-ature contrast between North Atlantic and North Pacific is found to be an indicator of THC changes. 1...|$|R

30|$|As {{the only}} pathway that connects {{different}} ocean basins {{in the tropics}} (Sprintall et al. 2014), the ITF {{plays an important role}} in heat and water volume balances in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, the ITF water is advected westward in the South Equatorial Current, and then flows south along the African coast, contributing to the Agulhas Current (Godfrey and Golding 1981; Godfrey 1996). The ITF waters can spread southward along the western Australian coast as a source of the Leeuwin Current, under the forces of the <b>meridional</b> steric <b>height</b> gradient in the southeast Indian Ocean (Gentilli 1972).|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of blocking episodes over the Southern Hemisphere, {{selected from the}} Era- 40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis are presented in this study. Blocking can be defined by an objective index based on two 500 hPa geopotential <b>height</b> <b>meridional</b> gradients. The seasonal cycle and preferential areas of occurrence are well reproduced by the two data sets. In both reanalysis used in this study, South Pacific and Oceania were the preferred regions for blocking occurrence, followed by the Atlantic Ocean. However the results revealed differences in frequencies of occurrences, which {{may be related to}} the choice of assimilation scheme employed to produce the reanalysis data sets. It is important to note that the ERA 40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis were produced using consistent models and assimilation schemes throughout the whole reanalyzed period, which are different for each set...|$|R
40|$|The {{role played}} by Southern Hemisphere sea ice in the global climate system is {{explored}} using an earth system climate model of intermediate complexity. An ensemble of experiments is analyzed in which fresh-water forcing equivalent to a complete 100 -yr meltback of Southern Hemisphere sea ice is applied to a model run that simulates the present climate. This freshwater forcing acts to mildy subdue Southern Ocean deep overturning, reducing mean Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) export by 0. 5 Sv (1 Sv 106 m 3 s 1) in the ensemble average. The decreased convective overturning cools the surface waters, thereby increasing sea ice volume and thus forming a negative feedback that stabilizes Antarctic sea ice. In contrast, the reduced convective overturn warms subsurface waters in the Southern Ocean, which, combined with the imposed freshening, results in {{a reduction in the}} <b>meridional</b> steric <b>height</b> gradient and hence a slowdown of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The reduction in ACC strength is, however, only modest at 1. 5 Sv. These responses are thus of only weak magnitude, and the system recovers to its original state over time scales of decades. An extreme scenario experiment with essentially instantaneous addition of this melt-water load shows similar results, indicating the limited response of the climate system to the freshening implied by Antarctic sea ice melt. An additional experiment in which a much larger freshwater forcing of approximately 0. 4 Sv is applied over 100 yr confirms the relatively weak response of the model’s climate state to such forcing, relative to the well-documented climatic effects of freshwater forcing added to the North Atlantic. 1...|$|R
40|$|GENOPT, {{a program}} {{that can be used}} to {{optimize}} anything, and BIGBOSOR 4, a program for stress, buckling, and vibration analysis of segmented, branched, stiffened, elastic shells of revolution, are combined to create a capability to optimize a specific kind of shell of revolution: an internally isogrid-stiffened elastic ellipsoidal shell subjected to uniform external pressure. Optimum designs are obtained for isogrid-stiffened and unstiffened axisymmetrically imperfect and perfect titanium 2 : 1 ellipsoidal shells. The decision variables are the shell skin thickness at several user-selected <b>meridional</b> stations, the <b>height</b> of the isogrid stiffeners at the same meridional stations, the spacing of the isogrid stiffeners (constant over the entire shell), and the thickness of the isogrid stiffeners (also constant over the entire shell).

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a new {{blocking}} definition with applicability to observations and model simulations. An updated review of previous blocking detection indices is provided {{and some of their}} implications and caveats discussed. A novel blocking index is proposed by reconciling two traditional approaches based on anomaly and absolute flows. Blocks are considered from a complementary perspective as a signature in the anomalous height field capable of reversing the <b>meridional</b> jet-based <b>height</b> gradient in the total flow. The method succeeds in identifying 2 -D persistent anomalies associated to a weather regime in the total flow with blockage of the westerlies. The new index accounts for the duration, intensity, extension, propagation, and spatial structure of a blocking event. In spite of its increased complexity, the detection efficiency of the method is improved without hampering the computational time. Furthermore, some misleading identification problems and artificial assumptions resulting from previous single blocking indices are avoided with the new approach. The characteristics of blocking for 40 years of reanalysis (1950 - 1989) over the Northern Hemisphere are described {{from the perspective of the}} new definition and compared to those resulting from two standard blocking indices and different critical thresholds. As compared to single approaches, the novel index shows a better agreement with reported proxies of blocking activity, namely climatological regions of simultaneous wave amplification and maximum band-pass filtered height standard deviation. An additional asset of the method is its adaptability to different data sets. As critical thresholds are specific of the data set employed, the method is useful for observations and model simulations of different resolutions, temporal lengths and time variant basic states, optimizing its value as a tool for model validation. Special attention has been paid on the devise of an objective scheme easily applicable to General Circulation Models where observational thresholds may be unsuitable due to the presence of model bias. Part II of this study deals with a specific implementation of this novel method to simulations of the ECHO-G global climate model...|$|R
40|$|Short meridional scale {{anomalies}} (SMSA) in {{the lower}} stratospheric temperature field were recently discovered by Stanford and Short (1981) in the analyses of Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channel 4 data. Newman and Stanford (1983) further elucidated the properties of these anomalies, and their work is duplicated herein;It is shown that 1000 - 3000 km meridional scale anomalies with 10, 000 - 40, 000 km zonal scales exist in the MSU channel 4 data, {{and the existence of}} these anomalies is independent of the analysis scheme. Additionally, these anomalies are observed in TIROS-N satellite MSU channel 3 data, as well as Nimbus 6 satellite Scanning Microwave Sounder (SCAMS) data. The atmospheric origin of the SMSA is established through the correlation of MSU channel 4 brightness temperatures with brightness temperatures simulated from European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) analyses, National Meteorological Center (NMC) analyses, and radiosonde data. These conventional data simulations correlate well with the MSU channel 4 data. The independence of the conventional and satellite data establishes that the SMSA are not due to instrumental effects;The horizontal, vertical, and time structure of the SMSA are studied using both satellite and conventional data. The SMSA exist in both hemispheres, have zonal scales of 10, 000 to 40, 000 km, and are strongest in the mid-latitudes. The vertical SMSA temperature structure shows maxima {{in the lower}} stratosphere and upper troposphere with a node between these maxima in the 200 to 400 mb region. The SMSA are not regularly propagating features. They are found to be episodic, with an episode lasting from 1 to 3 weeks;In addition to the temperature structure, the SMSA are also found in the zonal wind, <b>meridional</b> wind, geopotential <b>heights,</b> and possibly the low-level cloud data. Heat and momentum fluxes are investigated, and it is found that the fluxes due to the SMSA are not the most important parts of the total heat and momentum flux budgets. However, the portions due to the SMSA are not inconsequential. Finally, a possible forcing mechanism due to secondary effects of baroclinic instabilities is outlined for the SMSA...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of hourly {{radiosonde}} data of temperature, wind, {{and relative}} humidity during four days (two with convection and two with no convection) {{as a part}} of an intensive observation period in CPEA- 2 campaign over Koto Tabang (100. 32 ° E, 0. 20 ° S), Indonesia, are presented. Characteristics of gravity waves in terms of dominant wave frequencies at different heights and their vertical wavelengths are shown in the lower stratosphere during a convective and non-convective period. Gravity waves with periods ~ 10 h and ~ 4 – 5 h were found dominant near tropopause (a region of high stability) on all days of observation. Vertical propagation of gravity waves were seen modified near heights of the three identified strong wind shears (at ~ 16, 20, and 25 km heights) due to wave-mean flow interaction. Between 17 and 21 km <b>heights,</b> <b>meridional</b> wind fluctuations dominated over zonal wind, whereas from 22 to 30 km heights, wave fluctuations with periods ~ 3 – 5 h and ~ 8 – 10 h in zonal wind and temperature were highly associated, suggesting zonal orientation of wave propagation. Gravity waves from tropopause region to 30 km heights were analyzed. In general, vertical wavelength of 2 – 5 km dominated in all the mean-removed (~ weekly mean) wind and temperature hourly profiles. Computed vertical wavelength spectra are similar, in most of the cases, to the source spectra (1 – 16 km height) except that of zonal wind spectra, which is broad during active convection. Interestingly, during and after convection, gravity waves with short vertical wavelength (~ 2 km) and short period (~ 2 – 3 h) emerged, which were confined in the close vicinity of tropopause, and were not identified on non-convective days, suggesting convection to be the source for them. Some wave features near strong wind shear (at 25 km height) were also observed with short vertical wavelengths in both convective and non-convective days, suggesting wind shear to be the sole cause of generation and seemingly not associated with deep convection below. A drop in the temperature up to ~ 4 – 5 K (after removal of diurnal component) was observed at ~ 16 km height near a strong wind shear (~ 45 – 55 m s − 1 km − 1) during active period of convection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the use of both an Eulerian and system-centered method of storm track {{diagnosis}} applied to a wide range of meteorological fields at multiple levels to provide a range of perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter transient motions and to give new insight into the storm track organization and behavior. The data used are primarily from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses project extended with operational analyses to the period 1979 - 2000. This is supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Goddard Earth Observing System 1 reanalyses. The range of fields explored include the usual mean sea level pressure and the lower- and upper-tropospheric <b>height,</b> <b>meridional</b> wind, vorticity, and temperature, as well as the potential vorticity (PV) on a 330 -K isentropic surface (PV 330) and potential temperature on a PV = 2 PVU surface (theta(PV 2)). As well as reporting the primary analysis based on feature tracking, the standard Eulerian 2 - 6 -day bandpass filtered variance analysis is also reported and contrasted with the tracking diagnostics. To enable the feature points to be identified as extrema for all the chosen fields, a planetary wave background structure is removed at each data time. The bandpass filtered variance derived from the different fields yield a rich picture of the nature and comparative magnitudes of the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, and of the Siberian and Mediterranean candidates for storm tracks. The feature tracking allows the cyclonic and anticyclonic activities to be considered seperately. The analysis indicates that anticyclonic features are generally much weaker with less coherence than the cyclonic systems. Cyclones and features associated with them are shown to have much greater coherence and give tracking diagnostics that create a vivid storm track picture that includes the aspects highlighted by the variances as well as highlighting aspects that are not readily available from Eulerian studies. In particular, the upper-tropospheric features as shown by negative theta(PV 2), for example, occur in a band spiraling around the hemisphere from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward to the high latitudes of the same ocean basin. Lower-troposphere storm tracks occupy more limited longitudinal sectors, with many of the individual storms possibly triggered from the upper-tropospheric disturbances in the spiral band of activity...|$|R
40|$|Zonal and meridional winds {{have been}} {{measured}} in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere at polar latitudes using two ground-based meteor radars. One radar is located at Rothera (68 &deg; S, 68 &deg; W) in the Antarctic and has been operational since February 2005. The second radar is located at Esrange (68 &deg; N, 21 &deg; E) in the Arctic and has been operational since October 1999. Both radars have produced relatively continuous measurements. Here we consider measurements made {{up to the end}} of 2009. Both radars are of similar design and at conjugate geographical latitudes, making the results directly comparable and thus allowing investigation of the differences in the mean winds of the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The data from each radar have been used to construct climatologies of monthly-mean zonal and <b>meridional</b> winds at <b>heights</b> between 80 and 100 km. Both Antarctic and Arctic data sets reveal seasonally varying zonal and meridional winds in which the broad pattern repeats from year to year. In particular, the zonal winds display a strong shear in summer associated with {{the upper part of the}} westward summertime zonal jet. The winds generally reverse to eastward flow at heights of ~ 90 km. The zonal winds are eastward throughout the rest of the year. The meridional winds are generally equatorward throughout the year over both sites, although brief episodes of poleward flow are often evident near the equinoxes. The strongest equatorward flows occur at heights of ~ 90 km during summer. There are significant differences between the mean winds observed in the Antarctic and Arctic. In particular, the westward winds in summer are stronger and occur earlier in the season in the Antarctic compared with the Arctic. The eastward winds evident above the summertime zonal wind reversal are significantly stronger in the Arctic. The summertime equatorward flow in the Antarctic is slightly weaker, but occurs over a greater depth than is the case in the Arctic. Comparisons of these observations with those of the URAP and HWM- 07 empirical models reveal a number of significant differences. In particular, the zonal winds observed in the Antarctic during wintertime are significantly weaker than those of URAP. However, the URAP zonal winds are a good match to the observations of the Arctic. Significant differences are evident between the observations and HWM- 07. In particular, the strong wintertime zonal winds of the Arctic in HWM- 07 are not evident in the observations and the summertime zonal winds in HWM- 07 are systematically stronger than observed. The agreement with meridional winds is generally poor. There is a significant amount of inter-annual variability in the observed zonal and meridional winds. Particularly high variability is observed in the Arctic zonal winds in spring and is probably associated the stratospheric warmings...|$|R
