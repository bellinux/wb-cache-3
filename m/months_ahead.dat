30|$|For the {{conventional}} method, the forecasting {{accuracy of the}} <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> daily load profile and fuel price of each day is relatively low. However, the electricity price is strongly sensitive to the load and fuel prices. Forecasting errors of these input factors may result in non-negligible errors of the forecasted electricity price. For the proposed method, the forecasting accuracy of <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average daily load profile and <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average fuel price is relatively high. In other words, the forecasting errors of the input factors are small, and the forecasting error of the proposed method mainly originates from the modeling error.|$|R

5|$|Both roadways were {{expected}} to be completed by January1, 1935. They were ultimately completed in October 1934, six <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October27, 1934, as was the Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre, and they were attended by Robert Moses, at the time a candidate for Governor of New York, and Fiorello LaGuardia, the Mayor of New York City.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{took part}} in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok Atoll on 18 February 1944, code named Operation Catchpole. Because of the speed and success of the attack on Kwajalein, the attack was {{undertaken}} several <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the atoll. The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{start date}} was mid-1999, {{with the release}} date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X-Men to June. Steven Spielberg {{had been scheduled to}} film Minority Report for release in June 2000, but he had chosen to film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Fox needed a film to fill the void. This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule, although filming had been pushed back. The release date was then moved to July 14.|$|E

5|$|Works on {{the tram}} scheme were running two <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of {{schedule}} by September 2013, when Edinburgh Council announced the tramway would open by May 2014. All tram and road works were completed by 19 October with {{testing of the}} trams between the depot and Edinburgh Park commencing on 8 October 2013. This {{was followed by the}} energising of tram wires from Bankhead tram stop to York Place on 19 November, marking {{the first time that the}} route was completely energised. Testing along the full length of the route began on 5 December.|$|E
5|$|By January 24, {{the number}} {{had risen to}} more than 30,600 per day—three {{times as many as}} {{originally}} estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E
5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell would be out of action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was in the frame to return to action around Christmas time – three <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule.|$|E
30|$|<b>Month</b> <b>ahead</b> {{average daily}} {{electricity}} price profile forecasting {{is an essential}} task for retailors and investment decision making in electricity markets. A hybrid nonlinear regression and SVM model is proposed in this paper for <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average hourly price forecasting. In this model, prices of different periods in different months are forecasted by different methods. Three methods are adopted for prices of off-peak hours, peak hours in off-peak months and peak hours in peak months. A nonlinear price regression model with deviation compensation is proposed to forecast the prices of off-peak hours and prices of peak hours in off-peak months. SVM is adopted to forecast the prices of peak hours in peak months. The case study suggests that the hybrid method proposed in this paper performs well in <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average daily electricity price profile forecasting based on the ERCOT dataset.|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{released}} the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999, {{at a price}} of GB₤200. By November 24, 400,000 consoles had been sold in Europe. By Christmas of 1999, Sega of Europe reported selling 500,000 units, placing it six <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. Sales did not continue at this pace, and by October 2000, Sega had sold only about 1 million units in Europe. As part of Sega's promotions of the Dreamcast in Europe, the company sponsored four European football clubs: Arsenal F.C. (England), AS Saint-Étienne (France), U.C. Sampdoria (Italy), and Deportivo de La Coruña (Spain).|$|E
5|$|The Green Line {{stations}} at Greenbelt, College Park, Prince George's Plaza, and West Hyattsville {{opened in}} November 1993. Almost two years later, WMATA broke {{ground on the}} Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights stations, a $900 million project which would complete the final 6.5 miles (10.5km) of the originally-planned 103-mile (165.7km) Metrorail system in late 1999. The outbound tunnel to Congress Heights was completed in June 1998. The Georgia Avenue-Petworth and Columbia Heights stations were completed in September 1999, three <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. The Green Line's final five stations opened on January 13, 2001.|$|E

50|$|On November 12, 2008, Gov. Bob Riley and Alabama Transportation Director Joe McInnes cut {{the ribbon}} {{opening up the}} new 13.5 mi, four-lane highway. The project opened a <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was {{completed}} six <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule and officially opened on October27, 1934, by Robert Moses, then a candidate for Governor of New York, and New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls, which went into effect on January2, 1935. These tollbooths, once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo's The Godfather, were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey's efforts to establish that year's state budget.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed {{completely}} to traffic {{in both directions}} from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit49) to Clark Street (exit47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road {{as part of the}} Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along I-94 to I-275 and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> {{of time and}} knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian {{side of the border}} with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E

5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer <b>months</b> <b>ahead.</b> Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E
5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three <b>months</b> <b>ahead,</b> for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E
5|$|In 1294, Wales {{broke out}} in {{rebellion}} led by Madog ap Llywelyn, prince of Wales. As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power, it was targeted by the Welsh. Madog's forces captured the town in September, {{and in the process}} heavily damaged the town walls. The castle was defended by just a ditch and a temporary barricade. It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight. Fire raged across Caernarfon, leaving destruction in its wake. In the summer of 1295, the English moved to retake Caernarfon. By November the same year, the English began refortifying the town. Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority, and £1,195 (nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls) was spent on completing the job two <b>months</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292. Once the rebellion was put down, Edward began building Beaumaris Castle on the Isle of Anglesey. The work was overseen by James of Saint George; as a result, Walter of Hereford took over as master mason for the new phase of construction. By the end of 1301, a further £4,500 had been spent on the work with the focus of work on the northern wall and towers. The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing, possibly because there was a hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England's war against Scotland. Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300; he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed. Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate, Henry of Ellerton, took over the position of master mason. Construction continued at a steady rate until 1330.|$|E
