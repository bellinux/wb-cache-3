Using molecular biology techniques and standard culture techniques, we found evidence of a mixed mycobacterial infection with M. genavense and M. avium.

40|$|Mycobacteria cause {{increase}} in autoantibody {{production in the}} host during the first weeks of infection. The level of the autoantibody enhancement varies widely in different hosts, suggesting that it depends on features of the host make-up. We have investigated the participation of two characteristics of the host in the modulation of mycobacteria-induced autoantibody production: (i) the host being genetically determined to later develop spontaneous autoimmune disease; (ii) the host being susceptible/resistant to mycobacterial infection. <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection</b> was studied in 3 -month-old mice that are prone (NZB and C 57 B 1 / 6 -lpr/lpr strains) or not (NZW and C. D 2 strains) to develop, when older, autoimmune disease; these murine strains are either naturally susceptible (C 57 B 1 / 6 -lpr/lpr and NZW) or resistant (NZB and C. D 2) to mycobacteria. <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection</b> was produced by i. p. injection of 3 x 10 (7) viable bacilli. At days 15 and 30 of the infection, we determined the following parameters: (i) number of cells producing natural autoantibodies (splenic cells showing surface antibodies against bromelain-treated mouse (BrM) erythrocytes); (ii) suppression of the primary response to T cell-dependent antigen (i. e. to sheep erythrocytes); (iii) immunoglobulin classes and IgG isotypes; (iv) titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies; and (v) serum concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We found that the highest elevations in natural autoantibodies were associated with hosts being naturally susceptible to mycobacteria, {{but not with the}} host being genetically determined to later develop autoimmune disease. The rise in autoantibodies was predominantly of the IgM type, being associated with suppression of the T cell response and accompanied by {{increase in}} serum IFN-gamma. Mycobacteria failed to induce any significant enhancement in pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies. Our data suggest that the finding of a high level of autoantibodies during the early phase of mycobacterial infection reflects host susceptibility of the infectious agent, and that it is not related with its propensity to later develop autoimmune disorders...|$|E
40|$|Disseminated <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection</b> is {{the major}} cause of {{bacteremia}} in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

The increased susceptibility of such animals to M. avium infection is {{comparable to that of}} C 57 BL/ 6 beige mice and thus may provide a viable alternative to the latter model. Further, using representative strains of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated M. avium (serotypes 1, 4, and 8 and a rough isolate), we show that the course of such infections in thymectomized, CD 4 -deficient mice can be markedly restrained and in some cases the infections can be sterilized by treatment over a 120 -day period with a regimen containing 40 mg of the new antimycobacterial agent rifabutin per kg (body weight) ...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with the}} {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with disseminated <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection</b> have responded poorly to treatment with rifabutine (Ansamycin) and clofazimine, {{in spite of}} the good in vitro response of M. avium to these antimicrobial agents. We compared the ability of these and other antimicrobial agents to kill versus the ability to inhibit the growth of strains of the M. avium complex isolated from patients with AIDS. Killing curve experiments showed that the concentrations of rifabutine and clofazimine needed to kill two log units of M. avium are at least 32 times greater than the concentrations needed to inhibit growth. Little or no killing occurred at concentrations of these antimicrobial agents that are achievable in serum. In contrast, five of seven strains tested were killed by ciprofloxacin at concentrations that can be achieved in serum. Ciprofloxacin should be studied further for possible use in the treatment of M. avium infections...|$|E

40|$|Disseminated <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infections</b> {{are common}} in {{patients}} with AIDS and result in a reduced life expectancy. Human monocytes/macrophages are important target cells for both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and M. avium. We have studied the interaction in vitro of M. avium and HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) in human macrophages. Human monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals were infected with HIV- 1, M. avium, or both. The intracellular growth of M. avium and the replication of HIV- 1 were monitored for up to 5 weeks. Intracellular mycobacterial growth was seen in all M. avium infected cell cultures and was paralleled by increased production of interleukin 1 alpha and beta. Preinfection of the macrophages with HIV- 1 reduced the interleukin 1 production and accelerated the intracellular growth of M. avium. These findings may explain in part the impaired control of mycobacterial infections seen with patients with AIDS...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of molecular techniques to investigate strain relatedness may help define the local epidemiology of <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection,</b> and, by identifying false isolates (i. e. neither pathogens nor colonizers) resulting from contamination, {{may serve as}} a tool for quality control in the laboratory. For this purpose, isolates from all patients (n = 129) with Mycobacterium avium infections identified over a two-year period were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of 38 PFGE patterns identified, 34 corresponded to unique strains or to isolates present in no {{more than two or three}} individuals. One prevalent strain was identified among HIV-infected patients and three patterns were related to culture contamination events. PFGE (i) established the diversity of Mycobacterium avium strains in a community; (ii) identified the existence of a unique strain that may account for one-fifth of Mycobacterium avium isolated from HIV-infected patients locally; (iii) documented the extent and resolution of a suspected pseudo-outbreak; and (iv) uncovered an additional-unsuspected contamination event...|$|E
40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies specific for CD 27 ligand (CD 70), CD 30 ligand (CD 153), CD 134 ligand (OX 40 L), and CD 137 ligand (4 - 1 BBL) were screened in vivo {{for their ability}} to affect the control of <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> <b>infection</b> in C 57 B 1 / 6 mice. Only the blocking of CD 153 led to increased mycobacterial burdens. We then used CD 30 -deficient mice and found an increase in the proliferation of two strains of M. avium in these mice as compared with control animals. The increased mycobacterial growth was associated with decreased T cell expansion and reduced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses as a result of reduced polarization of the antigen-specific, IFN-gamma-producing T cells. At late times but not early in infection, the lymphoid cuff surrounding granulomas was depleted in the CD 30 -deficient animals. This report expands our knowledge about tumor necrosis factor superfamily members involved in the immune responses to mycobacterial infection by identifying CD 30 -CD 153 interactions as required for optimal immune control of M. avium infection...|$|E
