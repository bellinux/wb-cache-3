2500|$|By March 2002, Woodland Cemetery {{suffered}} extensively lack of maintenance. Numerous headstones and mausoleums {{had been}} defaced by graffiti, many gravestones had been toppled and some destroyed, and the grounds were strewn with trash and liquor bottles. Most of the cemetery's unpaved roads were impassable. [...] When Plain Dealer reporters interviewed Jim Glending, acting city properties chief, about the cemetery, he ordered {{an assessment of}} each cemetery so a repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>plan</b> could be developed. While the public and press blamed the very small budget for cemetery maintenance for the problems, some did not. Vicki Blum Vigil, {{author of a book}} on Cuyahoga County cemeteries, claimed that maintenance at Woodland Cemetery was better than at many privately owned cemeteries. Vigil blamed vandalism and an increasing number of cemetery visitors for Woodland's problems. The Plain Dealer report led to extensive maintenance improvements at Woodland over the next three months. Although mausoleums remains in disrepair and heavier monuments remained toppled due to lack of equipment to right them, a spokesperson for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War claimed the cemetery was in the best shape it had been in for the past ten years.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{industry}} spend a {{great deal}} of their capital on equipment maintenance for their production systems. Hence, the cost of improper maintenance management is something that the industry would like to avoid. Industrial maintenance activities are directly linked to the profitability of industries and affects the performance, dependability, and sustainability of production systems. Naturally, the equipment downtime directly affects the system performance, but the rippling effects (idle and blocked states of equipment) are also prime contributors to the inefficiency of production systems by constraining the flow of products in the production system. In addition to inefficiency, studies suggest that 30 % of the energy consumption in manufacturing industry is wasted on stand still equipment. Therefore, effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> for the resources is an extremely important activity. The aim of this thesis is to create effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> principles which will enable the production system to operate efficiently. Due to the discrete and complex nature of production systems, certain resources become critical that reduces system inefficiency the most. The focus of the thesis is to identify the critical resources and create continuous awareness of them in order to reduce its criticality through effective maintenance. The thesis identifies the critical resource of the production system that affects production efficiency the most. This criticality is identified by studying the gaps in current industrial state practices. Through this study, the purpose of establishing criticality from a holistic perspective is obtained to assist <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> accordingly. The research methods performed include descriptive surveys, questionnaires, and structured and semi-structured interviews. Moreover, the gaps in current industrial state practices for <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> of critical resources and the usage of criticality classification are also studied. In addition, solutions to reduce the criticality of these resources through <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> are identified and tested using simulation studies of two automotive industrial cases. The reduction in criticality is shown by reducing the active period of critical resource and increasing its utilization. In order to achieve this solution, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> principles used include throughput-critical resource identification, maintenance prioritization, and maintenance staff utilization. Reducing the criticality of these resources proved to increase the system throughput potential and further balance production lines. Applying these <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> principles to industries has the potential for making production systems function more efficiently, which was shown through obtaining 5 % throughput increase on average in one of the case studies. However, effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> requires continuous awareness of the critical resource, which requires robust decision support tools which constantly monitor the production system. Future work includes data-driven analysis for decision support tools for effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning,</b> which includes dynamic production system changes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{presenting}} {{a method to}} optimize the <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning</b> for a commercial heavy vehicle. Such a vehicle may {{be considered as a}} multi-components system. Grouping maintenance operations related to each component reduces the global maintenance cost of the system. Classically, the optimization problem is solved using a priori reliability characteristics of components. Two types of methods may be used, i. e. static or dynamic methods. Static methods provide a fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning,</b> whereas dynamic methods redefine the groups of maintenance operations at each decision time. Dynamic procedures can incorporate component information such as component states or detected failures. For deteriorating systems, reliability characteristics of each component may be estimated thanks to deterioration models and may be updated when a degradation measure is available. This additional information on degradation features allows to better follow the real state of each component and to improve the <b>maintenance</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R
