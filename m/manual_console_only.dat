50|$|The choir loft {{houses a}} large, four manual Steinmeyer pipe organ built in Ottengen, Bavaria with almost 5,000 pipes played for all Masses and Services by Cathedral organist Robert Corso.The organ {{contains}} 84 ranks of pipes divided with sections in the Chancel and Gallery. The {{tone of the}} organ ranges from a very deep profound bass, with many large wooden pipes, to a very brilliant sound with 14 ranks of mixtures on the Great, main manual alone, containing pipes with a high tin content, adding to the overall brilliance of sound. One {{of the features of}} the choir manual keyboard is a set of pipes made entirely of copper, named Copper Gedect. The large scale facade pipes consisting of the pedal Diapason 16' and the Great manual's Diapason 16' are constructed of zinc. In 1981 the Chancel organ was moved further North to allow more space in the Sanctuary. In 1990, a new 4 <b>manual</b> <b>console</b> was added by R. A Denton & Son of Hamilton, built by R.A Colby, Johnson City, Tennessee, temporarily used by the Mormon Tabernacle during their organ console rebuild in the late 1980s. The four manuals are named from top to bottom: Antiphonal/Echo, Swell, Great and Choir. The new console has solid state multiple memory banks for selecting different combinations of stops rapidly. The organ also contains two stops which are tuned sharp and flat to achieve a warm, rich tone. These are a Celeste on the Swell manual and an Unda Maris of the sea on the choir manual. In April 2016 a new Casavant French terraced four <b>manual</b> <b>console</b> was installed by the Casavant Freres firm of Ste. Hyacinthe, Quebec. The height of the console being quite low, allows the organist to conduct the choirs from the bench while accompanying. To rebuild the organ today in 2016 would most likely cost approximately $5 million Canadian dollars.|$|R
