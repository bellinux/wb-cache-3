25|$|The {{application}} of copper fungicide {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. <b>Metalaxyl</b> (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the {{application of}} fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot.

25|$|In Ghana, a {{study that}} {{combined}} the sanitation and fungicide application showed {{a significant reduction in}} the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (<b>metalaxyl)</b> fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommended}} {{standard for}} fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya {{for a season}} is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% <b>metalaxyl</b> + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation {{with one or two}} fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application.|$|E
50|$|Cavity spot {{differs from}} the other {{diseases}} of the carrot in that symptoms are only visible on {{the roots of the}} plant and therefore it is impossible to tell if a plant is infected from above ground. The primary symptom of cavity spot is small half-inch lesions on the roots of the plant. This disease is treated with <b>metalaxyl</b> which allows for almost complete control of the disease.

50|$|Phytophthora sojae {{can also}} be {{controlled}} using fungicides. For example, <b>Metalaxyl,</b> a fungicide that is specifically used for oomycetes, is used for treating soybean seeds. It’s used to prevent seed decay and pre-emergence damping off. This fungicide has been observed {{to be more effective}} on highly-tolerant soybean plants. <b>Metalaxyl</b> is most effective when applied to the soil as it allows the plant to take it up through the roots and elongate the control period in comparison to a seed application. <b>Metalaxyl</b> prevents the spores of Phytophthora sojae from entering the soybean plant tissues. As with all fungicides, <b>Metalaxyl</b> is effective for prevention only and should be applied before the disease has established itself inside the tissues of the soybean plant. Replanting must be done once severe pre-emergence damping off is observed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} currently used to manage M. phaseolina fungal infections. Often, fungicides {{are used to}} inhibit mycelial growth. These include thiram, iprodione, carbendazim, pyraclostrobin, fluquinconazol, tolyfluanid, and <b>metalaxyl</b> and penflufen + trifloxystrobin. The active ingredients carbendazim and penflufen + trifloxystrobin were shown {{to be the most}} powerful to control M. phaseolina. In this same study, the M. phaseolina isolate showed insensitivity to the active ingredients fluquinconazole, <b>metalaxyl,</b> thiram and tolyfluanid. Thus, fungicides are not necessarily an effective way to manage this fungal pathogen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metalaxyl</b> is an acylalanine {{fungicide}} with systemic function. Its {{chemical name}} is methyl N-(methoxyacetyl)-N-(2,6-xylyl)-DL-alaninate.

50|$|The {{damage to}} caused by Bremia to lettuce may {{not in itself}} be serious, but {{infected}} plants are susceptible to secondary infection by the more severe mould, Botrytis cinerea. The plant can suffer systemic infections. <b>Metalaxyl</b> is effective against this microorganism.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} of chemical, genetic, and cultural methods {{are used to}} control sorghum downy mildew. A number of single-gene sources of resistance have been found, and many resistant varieties are commercially available. However, new pathotypes of the fungus continue to evolve to overcome different sources of host plant resistance. Seed treatments with the systemic fungicides <b>metalaxyl</b> and mefenoxam {{have been widely used}} to prevent systemic infections of Sorghum Downy Mildew. <b>Metalaxyl,</b> which inhibits protein synthesis in the pathogen, can also be applied as a foliar spray. In Texas, use of these two fungicides, in conjunction with the use of resistant hybrids, made the disease a minor problem until one of the pathotypes endemic in the region evolved resistance to both chemicals.|$|E
50|$|If the {{conditions}} are right root rot can inflict yield losses up to 75% on a raspberry crop. Symptoms of the disease are destruction of root tissue and wilted primocanes and floricanes. <b>Metalaxyl</b> and fosetyl-al applied once in the fall or early spring {{have been shown to}} provide effective control of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides for {{the control}} of potato blight are {{normally}} only used in a preventative manner, optionally in [...] with disease forecasting. In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend {{on the nature of}} local strains of P. infestans. <b>Metalaxyl</b> is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of P. infestans became resistant to <b>metalaxyl,</b> but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as <b>metalaxyl</b> along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenytin, mancozeb and others. In the past, copper sulfate solution (called 'bluestone') was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that {{have been shown to be}} effective include horticultural oils, phosphorous acids, and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing [...] "beneficial" [...] microbes such as Bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{significant}} factor in control of this pathogen is correct sanitation and cultural practices. A well drained soil and discarding of debris and volunteer potatoes will limit the spread of this pathogen greatly. Since the pathogen needs high levels of moisture in the soil for dissemination, {{one of the most}} important factors to watch in controlling this pathogen is the moisture content. The storage of these potatoes should be keep dry and cool in order to prevent spread of the pathogen, and if at all possible reducing the amount of wounds on potatoes will also be beneficial. There is some chemical control procedures involving chemicals such as <b>metalaxyl,</b> are often used but resistance to these kinds of chemicals is starting to grow. [...] <b>Metalaxyl</b> and chemicals like it disrupt RNA polymerase and prevent transcription and is often used around a month before harvest. However, resistance to pink rot is being tested and encouraged in new cultivars of potatoes.|$|E
50|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{management}} {{exist for the}} prevention and suppression of disease. A cultural method that can be effective in preventing disease is sanitation. Equipment should be cleaned after use in infested fields so the disease does not spread into uninfested fields. To disrupt chlamydospore germination crops should be grown in drained disease free soil. Also, avoid transplanting without thorough knowledge of the transplant. To limit spread of structures limit traffic in infected fields and always clean after exposure. Disease is favored by pH values greater than 6.2, so lowering the pH is an effective method for preventing germination. pH management can be difficult because tobacco cannot survive in very low pH soils. Soil pH 5.5 to 6 allow successful growth of tobacco and control of disease. The cultural control, Crop rotation, is very effective at limiting disease. The longer an infected field is planted in a crop other than the initial infected crop, the lower the population will become. A minimum three year rotation is recommended. Crop rotation is recommended in combination with resistant varieties as genetic controls. Burley Tobacco, Burley Tobacco hybrids, and Dark Tobacco are varieties of tobacco that are resistant to Black Shank. Resistance however is not reliable because a single variety has resistance to only a few races of Black Shank. Finding new lines of resistance is becoming increasingly important due to new discovered resistant races of the pathogen. Chemical control is most successful if used with resistant varieties. <b>Metalaxyl</b> or mefenoxam are chemistries used to control Phytophthora nicotianae. Ridomil Gold is an example a systemic pesticide with a <b>Metalaxyl</b> chemistry. Mefenoxam is twice as active as <b>metalaxyl,</b> but they both have the same mode of action. Successful chemical control is difficult because we are limited to these two chemistries that are basically identical. A study by Csinos and Bertrand found out {{at a rate of}} 3.36 kg/ha would not inhibit many of the common races used in their study. Overall, from their study they observed that Black Shank severity was increasing in Georgia due to <b>Metalaxyl</b> sensitivity and resistant races of Black Shank.|$|E
50|$|Crown rot in {{asparagus}} {{was first}} reported in California in 1938 when Californian growers began {{to report a}} slimy, orange-yellow asparagus tissue with soft lesions causing post harvest losses of 20-30%. As lesions grow they eventually collapse and shrivel. In the 1980s it was shown that fungicidal treatments of <b>metalaxyl</b> increased yields by 80%. Today mefenoxam (metalaxyl-m) is the primary fungicide used to treat crown rot.|$|E
50|$|Applying {{fungicides}} {{that contain}} chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb, or <b>metalaxyl</b> {{as the main}} ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4-8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.|$|E
50|$|White rust was {{discovered}} in Texas in 1937 and primarily occurs in spinach crops found in eastern U.S. production areas. It has not been reported outside of the U.S. The main symptom of white rust is lesions on the leaf that grow and eventually release spores that cover and kill the entire leaf. Some cultivars of spinach have partial resistance to white rust but <b>metalaxyl</b> {{has been shown to}} be the best way to control the disease. It reduces yield loss from 50% in untreated plots to 1% in treated plots.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control of}} P. colocasiae has offered some {{relief in the}} form of {{preventative}} sprays containing copper, manganese, and zinc. The slanted shape of taro leaves, and prevalence of the crop in wet climates, necessitates numerous applications which may not be economically practical. The systemic fungicide <b>metalaxyl</b> has also been found to be effective in controlling P. colocasiae, especially when applied in conjunction with the pesticide mancozeb at the first sight of disease symptoms. While chemical control {{is one of the more}} effective methods of managing this pathogen, the fact that taro is usually a subsistence crop makes chemical control economically impractical and environmentally unsustainable.|$|E
50|$|Seed {{treatment}} {{has been shown}} to be effective in controlling the disease, as the establishment of P. halstedii in an area of soil is nearly irreversible. The compounds <b>metalaxyl</b> and oxadixyl have been shown to protect seeds in the case of infection, and treatments containing these compounds are commercially available. Fungicides seed dressings of this nature have also been shown to give significant control over the pathogen. However, some strains of P. halstedii have begun to show resistance to metalaxyl-based fungicides, reported in multiple countries. Alternate forms of resistance are being developed for the future, including the use of biological antagonists and defense-related proteins.|$|E

5000|$|Products {{should not}} be used in isolation, but rather as mixture, or {{alternate}} sprays, with another fungicide with a different mechanism of action.

The effectiveness of this technique can be demonstrated by <b>Metalaxyl,</b> a phenylamide fungicide.

However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application.It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management.|$|E
50|$|An {{array of}} studies have tested the {{curative}} and protective effects of various chemical compounds against P. ramorum in plants valued as ornamentals or Christmas trees. Many {{studies have focused on}} the four main ornamental hosts of P. ramorum (Rhododendron, Camellia, Viburnum, and Pieris). Several effective compounds have been found; some of the most effective include mefenoxam, <b>metalaxyl,</b> dimethomorph, and fenamidone. Many of these studies have converged upon the following conclusions: chemical compounds are, in general, more effective as preventives than in curatives; when used preventively, chemical compounds must be reapplied at various intervals; and chemical compounds can mask the symptoms of P. ramorum infection in the host plant, potentially interfering with inspections for quarantine efforts. In general, these compounds suppress but do not eradicate the pathogen, and some researchers are concerned that with repeated use the pathogen may become resistant to them. These studies and conclusions are summarized by Kliejunas.|$|E
50|$|Since Sclerophthora macrospora can infect a {{wide range}} of hosts, many growers will {{have to find a way}} to manage the pathogen. Cultural control, {{sanitary}} methods, and chemical control are common ways to prevent the disease. Typical cultural practices used include mowing only when grass is dry and avoiding over watering. Since the disease proliferates in wet conditions, it is best to ensure that fields are well drained so sporangia don’t spread. Preventive fungicides applied under certain guidelines can reduce the amount of the pathogen’s structures in the field - but the success is limited. Spring applications of the fungicide <b>metalaxyl,</b> known under the trade name Subdue, can be effective especially for yellow tuft disease. It is important to recognize that most fungicides for Sclerophthora macrospora are preventive type, not curative. Therefore, it is vital that a grower recognizes the symptoms and signs as soon as possible. A variety of resistance strains have also been bred - most notably in maize.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the United States spinach {{industry}} {{was not considered}} highly viable. Cultivars were vulnerable to downy mildew, which caused sharp reductions in quality and in select cases complete crop loss. Control by fungicide use was not practical. The spinach industry began to expand in 1947 when a strain of plant was introduced from Iran that was proven to be resistant to downy mildew. Therefore, {{it was not until}} the late 1970s that a new strain of the disease made downy mildew a problem for U.S. growers. The disease manifests as small yellow spots that quickly grow and rot the leaves. On the underside of the leaf blue mold spores grow and are spread to the rest of the spinach crop by wind. [...] Epidemics occur quickly due to the fast-growing nature of the fungus. After the new strain was discovered and began to destroy spinach fields, testing began in the 1980s with fungicides to control the disease. Research showed that <b>metalaxyl</b> was effective, reducing yield loss from 43% to 1% in treated fields.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best way}} to manage P. cactorum is by {{implementing}} an integrated management plan. The combination of soil fumigation and proper cultural controls {{will be the best}} option for plant health. Recommended chemical controls products include fosetyl Al, <b>metalaxyl,</b> and etridiazol. Prevention and sanitation are crucial because this pathogen is usually transmitted through cuts or injuries on the plant. The spores are easily transported through irrigation water and will splash to nearby plants. Elevating your plants above the ground can help to prevent infection. The pathogen thrives in moist soils therefore it is important to avoid very saturated soils as much as possible and one should work to prepare their soil for adequate drainage during the wet periods. Soil drainage and low soil pH may help to reduce the disease. [...] Fertilizer regimen methods have been used to control against P. cactorum. These fertilizers include organic materials that release ammonia, nitrous acid and amendments to reduce the pH to less than 4. [...] The use of raised beds and a carefully managed drip irrigation system will be important cultural practices that can be implemented. There are some form of Biological controls that {{have been found to be}} somewhat successful with Enterobacter aerogenes and Trichoderma.|$|E
5000|$|An {{integrated}} {{disease management}} program incorporating host resistance with disciplined cultural, {{chemical and biological}} methods {{is the best way}} to control P. medicaginis. [...] The first several weeks are especially critical in the management of P. medicaginis as infected seeds die in a short amount of time. Control of alfalfa and chickpea is mostly possible using effective water management, use of resistant cultivars, proper crop rotation and seed application of fungicides such as <b>metalaxyl.</b> Effective water management is aimed at keeping the plants as dry as possible while still getting them enough water. Several ways to do this include assuring good drainage, avoiding excessive irrigation, and allowing plants to be dried by the wind. Oospores can be spread by way of cultural practices on machinery, boots and hooves. This spread can be limited by using proper sanitation before moving from an infected field to a disease free field. All of these control methods are aimed at stopping the initial infection of the seed/plant; water management also functions to limit the spread of zoospores because they may be spread by floods. Stopping the initial infection is important because this disease affects plants early on in their development as it quickly causes root rot and damping off. P. medicaginis can reside in fields as oospores for up to 3.5 years so the crop rotation must be at least 3 years long.|$|E
5000|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{may reduce}} the number of pathogens in the soil and, [...] "a minimum of a 3 years crop rotation which alternates with non-host species is recommended to avoid build-up of P. capsici spores." [...] Crops should also avoid conditions that would be conducive to the pathogen by using well drained soils and raised beds. [...] As stated above, [...] "Excess moisture {{is the single most important}} component to the initial infection and subsequent spreading of Phytophthora capsici." [...] Overall, a study by K.H. Lamour and M.K. Hausbeck found that [...] "crop rotation and mefenoxam are not likely to provide economic control". Mefenoxem is the active enantiomer contained in the racemic fungicide <b>metalaxyl</b> used to defend against Phytophthora capsici. Sexual recombination provides the genetic diversity to promote resistance towards fungicides in P. capsici. The failure of crop rotation as a means to control P. capsici may also be due to weeds playing the role of an alternative host in the absence of common hosts. According to a study done by the University of Florida, [...] "In Florida, and perhaps elsewhere, weeds may contribute to pathogen survival in the absence of a host crop or when propagules may not readily survive in soil or plant debris." [...] To avoid fruit rot of vegetable crops in the Cucurbitaceae family, trellising cucurbit fruits and other ways to keep the fruit off the ground is a way to control secondary inoculents (zoospores) from physically being splashed from the soil onto the fruit. Control of Phytophthora capsici is easier in drier climates with less rainfall such as California. In these areas, it is important to practice placing drip irrigation emitters away from the stems of pepper plants in order to reduce the incidence of crown rot in peppers.|$|E

The aim of current study was to measure the frequency of <b>metalaxyl</b> resistance among Estonian population of Phytophtora infestans and to test efficacy of <b>metalaxyl</b> based fungicides in control of potato late blight. 138 isolates of Phytophtora infestans were collected from conventional, experimental and small scale growers fields in different parts of Estonia in 2003 - 2005 and assessed for resistance to <b>metalaxyl.</b> <b>Metalaxyl</b> resistant, intermediate and sensitive isolates were recorded at frequency of 37. 1, 45. 4 and 15. 1 %, respectively. Statistically significant differences (P< 0. 001) between locations, potato growing field types and years in the frequency of resistance to <b>metalaxyl</b> were observed. The proportion of metalaxyl-resistant isolates from different locations ranged from 0 to 67 %. <b>Metalaxyl</b> resistant isolates were predominant (66. 7 %) on conventional potato fields in 2004 and 2005 where <b>metalaxyl</b> consisting fungicide had been applied. In 2004 none metalaxyl-resistant strains were detected among isolates collected from the field (Naha) where <b>metalaxyl</b> containing fungicide was not used. As might be expected, insensitivity was more often found at conventional fields, where <b>metalaxyl</b> was commonly applied, than small scale growers fields where fungicides were rarely used. The increase of frequency of metalaxyl-resistant isolates has been detected in period from 2003 to 2005. Even the proportion of metalaxylresistant isolates fluctuates from year to year there are strong evidences that quantity of metalaxyl-resistant isolates has been increased compared with previous results (Runno, et al. 2005). Reason for such increase could be the more consistent use of <b>metalaxyl</b> containing fungicides. <b>Metalaxyl</b> showed lowered efficacy only in conditions of extreme late blight pressure in 2004. Therefore <b>metalaxyl</b> could be effectively used for control of potato late blight in maximum of two times during the growing period. As long as <b>metalaxyl</b> is used according to the recommendations in Estonia it is unlikely that metalaxyl-resistant isolates will completely displace sensitive isolates. Several reports suggest that resistance is unstable in the population and is selected anew each year, increasing steadily during the season and declining over winter (Gisi & Cohen 1996). Trials of late blight control with <b>metalaxyl</b> containing fungicide Ridomil Gold MZ 68 WG were performed in the same period. <b>Metalaxyl</b> containing fungicide was applied 2 times in all three years. The foliage of untreated plots was completely destroyed {{for the end of the}} growing season in all trial years. <b>Metalaxyl</b> provided high protection in 2003 and 2005, but showed lowered efficacy only in conditions of extreme late blight pressure in 2004 when the foliage was infected during the period when <b>metalaxyl</b> was used. The trial result show that in spite of occurrence of resistant strains the use of <b>metalaxyl</b> consisted fungicides is still effective. Therefore <b>metalaxyl</b> could be used effectively for control of potato late blight in maximum of two times in beginning of the fungicide treatments. By following the application rules for <b>metalaxyl</b> fungicides it is possible to restrict the development of metalaxyl-resistant strains and thus avoid the reduction of efficacy of the fungicide. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

The average initial deposit of <b>metalaxyl</b> on tomato fruits {{was found to be}} 2. 39 mgkg− 1. Residues of <b>metalaxyl</b> dissipated below the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 0. 5 mgkg− 1 in 7 days. Half-life (t 1 / 2) for degradation of <b>metalaxyl</b> on tomato fruit was observed to be 1. 81 days. A waiting period of 7 days is suggested for safe consumption of tomato. The results would be useful for the safe use of <b>metalaxyl</b> and to prevent any health problem to customers...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} in potato cultivars is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which affects leaves, stems and tubers. <b>Metalaxyl</b> is a fungicide that protects potato plants from Phytophthora infestans. In Mexico, farmers apply <b>metalaxyl</b> 35 times during the cycle of potato production and the last application is typically 15 days before harvest. There are no records related to the presence of <b>metalaxyl</b> in potato tubers in Mexico. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Acinetobacter sp on <b>metalaxyl</b> degradation in potato seedlings. The effect of bacteria and <b>metalaxyl</b> on the growth of potato seedlings was also evaluated. A metabolite profile analysis was conducted to determine potential molecular biomarkers produced by potato seedlings in the presence of Acinetobacter sp and <b>metalaxyl.</b> <b>Metalaxyl</b> did not affect the growth of potato seedlings. However, Acinetobacter sp strongly affected the growth of inoculated seedlings, as confirmed by plant length and plant fresh weights which were lower in inoculated potato seedlings (40 % and 27 %, respectively) compared to the controls. Acinetobacter sp also affected root formation. Inoculated potato seedlings showed a decrease in root formation compared to the controls. LC-MS/MS analysis of <b>metalaxyl</b> residues in potato seedlings suggests that Acinetobacter sp did not degrade <b>metalaxyl.</b> GC–TOF–MS platform was used in metabolic profiling studies. Statistical data analysis and metabolic pathway analysis allowed suggesting the alteration of metabolic pathways by both Acinetobacter s...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora nicotianae is {{a devastating}} root and stem {{pathogen}} of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in South Africa. Growers strive {{to control the}} resulting disease, known as black shank, with <b>metalaxyl</b> treatments and resistant cultivars. The {{aim of this study}} was to consider whether development of <b>metalaxyl</b> resistance in P. nicotianae has contributed to poor disease control and if recently developed cultivars with high levels of resistance require <b>metalaxyl</b> for effective control. One hundred and thirty-two isolates of P. nicotianae were screened for sensitivity to <b>metalaxyl.</b> P. nicotianae isolates from most tobacco farms were <b>metalaxyl</b> sensitive. Growth of most isolates was inhibited completely at 1. 0 μg a. i. /ml. However, isolates from the MKTV tobacco producing area showed EC 50 values ranging from 1. 02 μg a. i. /ml to 3. 57 μg a. i. /ml. Twenty-one tobacco cultivars were planted and treated with and without <b>metalaxyl</b> in two different growing seasons to evaluate their resistance to P. nicotianae and the value of using <b>metalaxyl.</b> Hicks was the most susceptible cultivar. Vuma/ 3 / 46, LK 30 / 40 / 60 - 1, and LK 33 / 60 exhibited the greatest resistance to P. nicotianae. Use of <b>metalaxyl</b> in combination with moderately resistant cultivars such as NC 60 × TL 33 and LK 10 / 80 / 60 effectively reduced black shank in the field. Resistant cultivars were healthy and no significant difference between <b>metalaxyl</b> treated and untreated plants was observed...|$|E
