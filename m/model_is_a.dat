In physics, a matrix <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{particular kind of}} physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves {{the notion of a}} matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The DCIEM 1983 {{decompression}} <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> decompression {{calculation model}} {{rather than a}} physiological model. Modifications {{were made to the}} model to get it to fit observed data, as the original model had several observed shortcomings, while retaining the basic model structure so that it could be applied to existing hardware with minimal modifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} compliance <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{regulatory framework}} or model known as dualistic, where the regulator reacts to an entity's behaviours {{depending on whether}} the behaviour is seen as either right or wrong. This is also known as a black and white response, and is often used for strict liability offences in law.|$|E

5|$|A station <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{symbolic}} illustration {{showing the}} weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model.

5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sexually {{receptive}} female, {{which provides a}} strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, swinging a sticky ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|E
