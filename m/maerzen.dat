A Bavarian brewing ordinance decreed in 1553 [...] that beer may be brewed only between 29 September and 23 April. The Märzen was brewed in March (März in German is [...] "March") according to a special recipe {{that would allow the}} beer to last while the brewing of new beer was forbidden from 24 April to 28 September. The original Märzen was described as [...] "dark brown, full-bodied, and bitter". The beer was often kept in the cellar until late in the summer, and remaining bottles were served at the Oktoberfest.|$|E
