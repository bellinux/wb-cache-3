5|$|<b>Masked</b> shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the <b>masked</b> shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the <b>masked</b> shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

40|$|The {{abnormal}} visual <b>masking</b> {{in those}} with schizophrenia, it has been proposed, arises from a deficiency in their magnocellular system. Two kinds of <b>masking</b> exist: Type-A and Type-B. Type-A <b>masking</b> {{is characterized by the}} <b>masking</b> being strongest when target and <b>mask</b> are presented simultaneously. Type-B <b>masking</b> is characterized by a non-monotonic <b>masking</b> curve, i. e. the <b>masking</b> is largest when the <b>mask</b> is presented at some time after the target. The proposed link between <b>masking</b> and magnocellular activity applies mainly to Type-B <b>masking.</b> Thus, a magnocellular deficiency, if it exists, should effect Type-B <b>masking</b> more prominently than Type-A <b>masking.</b> Here we review the relevant literature. The majority of studies of <b>masking</b> {{in those with}} schizophrenia, it is found, have examined only Type-A <b>masking.</b> These find substantial evidence for abnormal <b>masking.</b> Where Type-B <b>masking</b> has been obtained, evidence also exists for abnormalities. However, the abnormal <b>masking</b> in these cases is largely unrelated to the defining characteristic of Type-B <b>masking</b> (i. e. to the non-monotonic <b>masking</b> function). It is concluded that the evidence for linking <b>masking</b> abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically to Type-B <b>masking</b> is weak. This undermines the proposal that <b>masking</b> abnormalities in schizophrenia have a magnocellular origin...|$|R

40|$|In part I {{we showed}} that with {{spatially}} non-overlapping targets and <b>masks</b> both local metacontrast-like interactions and attentional processes are involved in backward <b>masking.</b> In this second part we extend the strategy of varying the contents of <b>masks</b> to pattern <b>masking</b> where targets and <b>masks</b> overlap in space, in order to compare different <b>masking</b> theories. Images of human faces were backward-masked by three types of spatially quantised <b>masks</b> (the same faces as targets, faces different from targets, and Gaussian noise with power spectra typical for faces). Configural characteristics, rather than the spectral content of the <b>mask,</b> predicted the extent of <b>masking</b> at relatively long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). This poses difficulties for the theory of transient-on-sustained inhibition as the principal mechanism of <b>masking</b> and also for local contour interaction being a decisive factor in pattern <b>masking.</b> The scale of quantisation {{had no effect on}} the <b>masking</b> capacity of noise <b>masks</b> and a strong effect on the capacity of different-face <b>masks.</b> Also, the decrease of configural <b>masking</b> with an increase in the coarseness of the quantisation of the <b>mask</b> highlights ambiguities inherent in the re-entrance-based substitution theory of <b>masking.</b> Different <b>masking</b> theories cannot solve the problems of <b>masking</b> separately They should be combined {{in order to create a}} complex, yet comprehensible mode of interaction for the different mechanisms involved in visual backward <b>masking.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
