40|$|A field {{experiment}} was undertaken in northern Ontario {{in order to}} assess the magnesium status of beef cattle raised in the area. Magnesium status was assessed using several criteria including blood and urine magnesium levels, and bone biopsy samples. Eighteen groups each containing four pregnant Shorthorn beef cows were used. Each of the following three mineral feeds were offered to six groups throughout the experiment: a <b>mineral</b> <b>feed</b> without magnesium, a <b>mineral</b> <b>feed</b> containing 8 % magnesium in the form of magnesium oxide and the third containing sequestered magnesium with a magnesium level of about a tenth of that in the <b>mineral</b> <b>feed</b> containing magnesium oxide. During the winter, when the cows were housed indoors, they were fed grass silage. Six groups, two of each <b>mineral</b> <b>feed,</b> remained indoors throughout the summer. The other 12 groups were turned out to pasture on May 25 and continued receiving the appropriate <b>mineral</b> <b>feed.</b> There were no differences in serum magnesium owing to magnesium-supplementation treatments observed at any time during any experiment. Serum magnesium levels fell drastically in all groups before the cows were released to pasture, implying that the hypomagnesaemic condition was attributable to the stress of yarding. The rate of recovery from hypomagnesaemia was slower in the cows released to pasture than in those kept indoors. Urine samples from cows returned to the pasture were indicative of low magnesium status. At the end of the experiment, the magnesium levels in the bones of the housed animals were higher than for those on pasture. In spite of severe cases of hypomagnesaemia, no clinical signs of this metabolic condition were observed...|$|E

Approach: In order to evaluate the potential participation of macroalgae in sustainable animal feeding, it was necessary to consider several concepts, such as: Waste Minimization (WM), Cleaner Production (CP) and Pollution Prevention (PP), which were closely related to sustainable production. Special attention was also paid to the prevention of waste generation during production process of <b>mineral</b> <b>feed</b> additives from macroalgae. Results: This kind of feed additives could contribute to the minimization of nutrient excretion by animals, by optimizing nutrient availability and proportion in the animal diet.

Enrichment of natural biomass of edible microalgae with microelement metal ions, which supply microelements of feeding significance in livestock diet, is considered in term of sustainable production. Approach: Production of microalgae-derived products as <b>mineral</b> <b>feed</b> additives requires elaboration of the processes for cultivation of alga, enrichment process and afterwards recovery of the enriched biomass from the solution to obtain liquid free of cells that could be reused in the next process. In this study membrane bioreactor was considered as a method for separation, both in photobioreactor (growth of microorganism) {{as well as in the}} enrichment process.

During molt period (2 Weeks), experimental birds {{were randomly assigned to}} five-treatment groups viz., A (15 ppm copper sulphate), B (20 ppm zinc oxide), C (20 ppm aluminium oxide), D (balanced layer diet without added minerals) and E (without induced molting as control). The birds in groups A, B, C and D were offered respective experimental diets at the rate of 30 g/bird except bird's in-group E (ad libitum) and lighting program was followed as 12 L: 12 D. During rest period (3 Weeks) the birds in groups A, B, C and D were given respective experimental diet at the rate of 50 g/bird for first 2 weeks of the rest period. During 3 rd week of rest period the birds in groups A, B, C and D were given experimental diets at the rate of 60 g/bird and were placed on lighting program of 14 L: 10 D. During production phase, the birds of all groups were fed a balanced layer diet (ad libitum) and birds were placed again on lighting program of 16 L: 8 D.

The non-molted birds (group E) exhibited the greatest (p< 0. 05) feed intake over the 2 weeks molt whereas birds on minerals supplemented diets ate the least (p< 0. 05) feed. On average non-molted hens fed a balanced layer diet and molted hens fed without minerals diet had lower (p< 0. 05) egg production when compared with molted hens fed mineral added diets after 20 weeks post molt.

40|$|Climate change, with a {{constant}} {{increase in the}} Earth temperature, negatively affects livestock production and health. This paper {{will focus on the}} possible nutritional and feeding strategies to mitigate the negative impact of heat stress (HS) on ruminants. The first nutrient interacting with hot weather conditions is fibre and its digestibility. It is well recognised how fibre may affect voluntary dry matter intake (DMI), chewing and ruminating activity. A possible dietary strategy to counteract the reduced DMI under hot environment is represented by the increased diet energy concentration, protein supply and essential aminoacids. <b>Mineral</b> <b>feeding</b> under HS condition must cover the supply of each nutrient as consequence of altered turnover, and the needs related to buffer requirements. Particular interest is growing in the use of Se (Se-yeast), because of its role to support the animal antioxidative defences. Water is a pivotal nutrient to cope with HS in ruminants because it plays a role in animal thermoregulation. Recently, some vitamins and feed additives were studied for their action on the animal physiology to cope with HS. Among vitamins, niacin was tested for its action on the vasodilatation in the mammalian and for its role in lipid metabolism; among feed additives, yeasts and plant extracts may exert a positive action in rumen metabolism as well as in regulation of body temperature...|$|R

In this study the effect of seed mixture (alsike clover, red clover, white clover, white and alsike clover or grass mixture), year (1997, 1998) and grazing period (5 per grazing season) on the herbage calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) phosphorous (P) and sodium (Na) contents was assessed and the relationships between botanical proportions and herbage mineral contents were studied. Herbage Ca and Na contents varied between the seed mixtures, Ca, Mg, P and Na contents between the years and all measured minerals, except Na, between the grazing periods.
