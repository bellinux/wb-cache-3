5|$|The episode {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of Davros since the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks; he is portrayed by Julian Bleach. It is also the first Doctor Who appearance of Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper; Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones; Tommy Knight as Luke Smith; and Alexander Armstrong {{as the voice of}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith.</b> Adjoa Andoh and Penelope Wilton reprise supporting roles as Martha's mother Francine Jones and former Prime Minister Harriet Jones respectively. Paul O'Grady and Richard Dawkins make cameo appearances as themselves as television personalities who attempt to assuage public fear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> is strikingly {{similar to that}} of Helene's, as if she, herself, were {{speaking}} through <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith.</b> Through the story of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> Helene argues that a successful pregnancy is possible when there is a loving relationship between mother and daughter, which 'smoothly socializes daughters into becoming mothers themselves.' Mirroring the life of Helene, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith's</b> problem is resolved during the next pregnancy when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> identifies with a pregnant friend, and particularly with the friend's mother. Helene wrote that the friend's mother was the opposite of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith's</b> mother. [...] She was filled with maternal warmth for both <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> and her own daughter. This maternal love, shared with her friend, allowed <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> to become a mother. According to Helene, although a healthy relationship between mother and daughter was important for a healthy pregnancy, equally important was the ability to lean on a female friend who could act as a surrogate sister for the pregnant woman. This idea is furthered when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> and her friend became pregnant again around the same time. This time, there was no anxiety or fear surrounding pregnancy, but when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith's</b> friend moved away, she miscarried. The diagnosis, according to Helene, was that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> suffered from 'over-excitability of the uterus.' A successful pregnancy, therefore, could only be brought about by leaning on another woman.|$|R

50|$|Geoffrey Denis Smith (23 March 1928 - 27 February 2009) was a {{professional}} gardener, broadcaster, writer and lecturer. He was the presenter of Gardeners World from 1980 to 1982 {{and a number of}} other BBC series in the early 80s including Geoffrey Smith's World of Flowers, <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith’s</b> Flower Garden, <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith's</b> Favourite Garden and <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith’s</b> Indoor Garden all of which were accompanied by books.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Wes Archer, {{and it was the}} first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith</b> Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|Once Sarah Jane has {{analysed}} {{that the}} Bane ingredient was sentient, she activates her computer, <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith</b> - after some shouting by Kelsey - and contacts Wormwood and politely requests that she leaves Earth. Wormwood refuses, and in retaliation takes {{control of the}} majority of the human race. Sarah Jane races to the factory, but cannot enter until she drives the bus into a wall. Wormwood reveals the Bane Mother, and explains the Archetype is a conglomerate of human DNA designed to be investigated so that Bubble Shock could be improved. The Archetype uses an alien communicator Sarah Jane had been given, realising that the signal would be strong enough to kill the Bane Mother, and Sarah Jane, Maria, and the Archetype escape as the factory explodes.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith</b> Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1990s, Flowers {{acquired}} the Keebler Company and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith's</b> Pies. In 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders. Flowers’ remaining business units, Flowers Bakeries and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith’s</b> Bakeries, were then spun {{off into a}} new company called Flowers Foods. In 2003, Flowers Foods sold its <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith’s</b> frozen dessert business to the Schwan Food Company.|$|R
25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith's</b> fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|R
60|$|She {{had once}} partly promised <b>Mrs</b> <b>Smith</b> {{to spend the}} evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Smith</b> gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.|$|R
5|$|Homer test {{drives a}} new {{electric}} car {{so that he}} can get a free gift. After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith</b> Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E
5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith)</b> in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Millson appears {{throughout}} the first series as Maria's recently separated father, Alan, with Chrissie Jackson, Maria's mother, played by Juliet Cowan. One other regular is Alexander Armstrong of comedy duo Armstrong and Miller, who provides {{the voice of}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Smith,</b> an extraterrestrial computer in Sarah Jane's attic.The 2007 special featured Samantha Bond as the scheming villain Mrs Wormwood and Jamie Davis as her PR agent Davey. The first series included among its guest cast Jane Asher as Sarah Jane's childhood friend Andrea Yates, Floella Benjamin as Professor Rivers, who returned in Series 2, Series 3 and Series 5, and Phyllida Law as Bea Nelson-Stanley. The second series guest starred Bradley Walsh as an evil alien clown in the story The Day of the Clown and Russ Abbot as a sinister astrologer in Secrets of the Stars. Also appearing in the second series were Gary Beadle and Jocelyn Jee Esien, who portrayed Clyde's parents Paul and Carla in The Mark of the Berserker; Esien reprised her role briefly in Series 4 and more prominently in series 5. Nicholas Courtney guest starred in Enemy of the Bane as classic Doctor Who character Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart, and Samantha Bond also returned as Wormwood for the episode.|$|E

25|$|So strong was her {{box office}} appeal {{by now that}} she was one of four finalists for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939). The film's producer, David O. Selznick, had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with Paramount Pictures. Arthur re-united with {{director}} Frank Capra and Stewart for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith</b> Goes to Washington (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naive <b>Mr.</b> <b>Smith</b> the ways of Washington, D.C.|$|E
