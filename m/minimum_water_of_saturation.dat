30|$|In this study, after {{ordering}} {{data from}} high {{to low and}} determining the frequency of each datum, the cumulative frequency diagram <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> was drawn (Fig.  8) then communities and threshold limit anomalies from matrix were determined by trending straight lines to points series and specifying failure point on the line (Fig.  9).

30|$|Due to its nature, product <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> by {{porosity}} cannot {{serve as}} a good expression for differentiating the rock types in the model, because the cases with low porosity possess high water saturation and those with high porosity hold low water saturation (as an example, a point with porosity and <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> 4 % and 60 %, respectively, and another point with porosity and <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> 12 % and 20 %, respectively) fall within the same range when {{the result of this}} relationship is concerned.|$|R

40|$|This work {{consists}} {{in studying the}} effect <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates {{on the development of}} shrinkage and the potential cracking risk of early age ordinary concrete. Different concretes were obtained from a given concrete mixture by changing only the initial degree <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> limestone aggregates. Three degrees <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> were studied, namely: 0 % (dry aggregates), 50 % (partially saturated aggregates) and 100 % (saturated aggregates). From the experimental results, the early age behaviour and the mechanical properties of the concrete strongly depend on the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates. A relative cracking risk was estimated from a stress-based approach and experimentally assessed parameters. The potential risk of cracking of these different concretes was shown to be different. Even if the total water content is kept constant, the water remaining in the cement paste actually depends on the initial <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates. The early age behaviour of concrete and the development of its early age properties depend on the amount <b>of</b> added <b>water</b> during the mixing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract: Theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in {{oil-water}} {{fluid flow}} area is meaningful to the high, stabilized {{production and the}} improvement of ultimate recovery. At present, there is no theoretical description <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in the oil and water seepage process. Combining relational expression between relative permeability and water saturation with the fractional flow equation produces an expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> cut changed by water saturation; Introducing Taylor expansion and Vieta's theorem to the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> cut gives a theoretical expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in oil-water fluid flow area; Possibility of continuity <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> is also discussed. Applying this formula to certain sandstone reservoir in China achieves good results: In oil-water seepage process, water saturation is continuous in certain interval and the values of it are double in another interval; the oil recovery can be re-calculated and improved with this new equation. This new water saturation equation lays a base {{for the study of}} residual oil mobility and enhanced oil recovery...|$|R

30|$|In this method, rock typing {{is based}} on the form of {{capillary}} pressure curves and, particularly, corresponding residual water saturations.

40|$|Estimation {{of dynamic}} petrophysical {{properties}} of water-bearing sands invaded with oil-base mud from {{the interpretation of}} multiple borehole geophysical measurements Zoya Heidari 1 and Carlos Torres-Verdín 2 Nonmiscible fluid displacement without salt exchange takes place when oil-base mud (OBM) invades connate water-saturated rocks. This is a favorable condition for the estimation of dynamic petrophysical properties, including saturation-dependent capillary pressure. We developed and successfully tested a new method to estimate porosity, fluid saturation, per-meability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability of water-bearing sands invaded with OBM from multiple borehole geophysical measurements. The estimation method simulates the process of mud-filtrate invasion to calculate the correspond-ing radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Porosity, permeabil-ity, capillary pressure, and relative permeability are iteratively adjusted in the simulation of invasion until density, photoelectric factor, neutron porosity, and apparent resistivity logs are accu-rately reproduced with numerical simulations that honor the postinvasion radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Examples <b>of</b> application include oil- and gas-bearing reservoirs that exhi-bit a complete capillary fluid transition between water at the bot-tom and hydrocarbon at irreducible water saturation at the top. We show that the estimated dynamic petrophysical properties in the water-bearing portion of the reservoir are in agreement with vertical variations <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> above the free water-hydrocarbon contact, thereby validating our estimation method. Additionally, it is shown that the radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> inferred from apparent resistivity and nuclear logs {{can be used for}} fluid-substitution analysis of acoustic compres-sional and shear logs...|$|R

40|$|NoA novel {{technique}} for the laboratory {{characterization of the}} frequency-dependent acoustic surface admittance of partly saturated samples of sands is presented. The technique {{is based on a}} standard laboratory de-watering apparatus coupled with a standard acoustic impedance tube. The dependence of the surface admittance on the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> is investigated for two samples of sand with widely different flow resistivities. It is shown that a relatively small change (e. g., from 0 % to 11 % by volume) in the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> can result in a much larger change (e. g., twofold) in the acoustic surface admittance. An empirical relationship is found between the peaks observed in the real part of admittance spectra for the low flow resistivity sand and the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> The data are compared with predictions of two widely used ground impedance models: a semiempirical single parameter model and a two parameter model.
