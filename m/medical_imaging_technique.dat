5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is a <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> using low-coherence interferometry {{to provide}} tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of}} a typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

Using <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as MRI, PET, MEG, EEG, and NIRS, scientists have been investigating how the brain processes and acquires language. This special issue concerns the processing and acquisition of languages, and the investigations that apply <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> to functional brain imaging studies. Hence the purpose of this special issue is to collect articles on studies of language processing and acquisition in humans utilizing <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques.</b> This special issue will contribute to uncovering the mechanisms of language processing and acquisition, and also to clarifying some of the questions concerning the clinical aspects of language deficits.

25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography {{is based on}} low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the range}} of noninvasive {{three-dimensional}} <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to ultrasound <b>imaging.</b> Other <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.|$|R
2500|$|Megavoltage {{computed}} tomography (MVCT) is a <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> {{that uses the}} Megavoltage range of X-rays to create an image of bony structures or surrogate structures within the body. The original rational for MVCT was spurred by the need for accurate density estimates for treatment planning. Both patient and target structure localization were secondary uses. A test unit using a single linear detector, consisting of 75 cadmium tungstate crystals, was mounted on the linear accelerator gantry. The test results indicated a spatial resolution of [...]5mm, and a contrast resolution of 5% using this method. While another approach could involve integrating the system directly into the MLA, it would {{limit the number of}} revolutions to a number prohibitive to regular use.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnostic {{modalities}} such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and EMG {{are mostly}} useful in excluding other conditions. However, magnetic resonance neurography is a <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> that {{can show the}} presence of irritation of the sciatic nerve {{at the level of}} the sciatic notch where the nerve passes under the piriformis muscle. Magnetic resonance neurography is considered [...] "investigational/not medically necessary" [...] by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split piriformis muscle – this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery. Image guided injections carried out in an open MRI scanner, or other 3D image guidance can accurately relax the piriformis muscle to test the diagnosis. Other injection methods such as blind injection, fluoroscopic guided injection, ultrasound, or EMG guidance can work but are not as reliable and have other drawbacks.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI), or nuclear magnetic {{resonance imaging}} (NMRI), is primarily a <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> most commonly used in radiology to visualize the structure and function of the body. Dr. Raymond Damadian, an Armenian-American scientist, who while researching the analytical properties of magnetic resonance, created the world's first magnetic resonance imaging machine in 1972. Damadian filed the first patent for an MRI machine, U.S. patent #3,789,832 on March 17, 1972, which was later issued to him on February 5, 1974. Damadian along with Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith, subsequently went on to perform the first MRI body scan {{of a human being}} on July 3, 1977. Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of MRI in medicine, Paul Lauterbur of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Sir Peter Mansfield of the University of Nottingham were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their [...] "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging." [...] The award was vigorously protested by Damadian, founder of FONAR Corporation, who claimed that he invented the MRI and that Lauterbur and Mansfield had merely refined the technology.|$|E
