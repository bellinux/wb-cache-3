Louis-René Villermé is also accounted {{as the author of}} the one of the first life expectancy tables that directly linked income to <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and life expectancy. He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{demonstrate}} the trend of overall <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> and premature <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for select types of cancer in Japan and to assess the utility as a target indicator. The age-adjusted <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for the total population (overall <b>mortality</b> <b>rate)</b> and that for persons under 65 years of age (under 65 <b>mortality</b> <b>rate)</b> for stomach cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer from 1950 to 1997 in Japan were calculated. Moreover, the turning point year of the mortality trend was estimated using a regression model of the rate of annual increase in each <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> As the results show, a decline in the under 65 <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> preceding a decline in the overall <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> was observed in stomach cancer and male liver cancer. Also, the under 65 <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> due to lung cancer seemed to begin to decline in recent years for males, while the overall <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> has been increasing. This study suggests that the premature <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> is a more sensitive indicator of the effectiveness of cancer prevention. Hence, because of not only the larger burden of premature deaths, but also the sensitivity, premature mortality is considered to be suitable as a target indicator for cancer prevention strategies...|$|R

In particular, he alleged that the high <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E

ResultsIn this study, a negative significant correlation was observed between HDI and IMR (r = - 0. 878, P = 0. 001), NMR (r = - 0. 870, 95 % CI: - 0. 902, - 0. 828, P = 0. 001), ConclusionIMR, children under one year old and under 5 years, and MMR mostly occur in developing countries.

5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population.
