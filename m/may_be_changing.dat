5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era.

25|$|Seventh, some {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Beck ruling may lead to unanticipated outcomes. At least one commentary on Beck concludes that Beck rights, if successfully implemented, may lead large numbers of workers to resign from a union during a strike. These workers will be able to continue to work during a strike (incurring none of the disadvantages a strike brings), and yet will still be able to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining (assuming the strike is successful and an agreement is negotiated). The strike is the most powerful weapon unions have, and undermining the union's ability to strike would put labor unions at a distinct disadvantage in collective bargaining. The NLRB and Supreme Court have acknowledged the role that agency fee payers can play in undermining strikes. In NLRB v. Textile Workers Union, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that once a union member had resigned, the union could not punish that worker for crossing picket lines. And in Pattern Makers' League v. NLRB, (as noted above) the Court said unions must permit members to resign at any time. Decisions like these have informed the NLRB's rulings on the issue as well. The Board found that an employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when it distributed notices to employees prior to a strike that outlined an employee's rights during a strike (including the right to become an agency fee payer and cross picket lines). The Board also held that, once a single employee has inquired about their right to become an agency fee payer, it is legal for an employer to notify all workers about this right. But {{in the absence of an}} employee-initiated iniquiry, it is not, the Board says, legal for employers to approach striking workers and ask them to become agency fee payers. The negative implications of widespread worker resignation from unions prior to or during a strike is clear, some argue. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>changing,</b> however, as more unions turn away from strikes and toward comprehensive campaigns. It is also unclear how Beck may impact dues checkoff (an agreement between the employer, union, and employee under which the employer agrees to deduct union dues directly from the employee's paycheck and turn it over to the union). In 1991, the NLRB held that dues checkoff agreements create an obligation to pay dues in the same way that becoming a union member does. It is possible that Beck and subsequent rulings could also undermine dues checkoff agreements.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{philosophy of}} this model is to bring physician-centred definitive care to the patient, rather than bringing the patient to the care. [...] As a result, in addition to conventional ambulances, most communities have physicians (called Notarzt) who respond directly to every life-threatening call to provide care. [...] This system does not recognize emergency medicine as a medical specialty, {{in the sense that}} North Americans understand it. [...] In these cases, the 'emergency physician' is most commonly an anesthetist, or sometimes an internist or even a surgeon. [...] In most places, there appears to be little interest in the development of emergency medicine as a specialty, although recent developments in Italy suggest that this attitude <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>changing.</b> [...] In this model, long 'at scene' times are common, with the physician attempting to provide {{some or all of the}} intervention that is necessary in place, with transportation to hospital occurring only for those with a legitimate need of a hospital bed, and urgent transportation to hospital being extremely rare. [...] Many patients will never be transported to hospital. [...] In the French version {{of this model}}, even the triage of incoming requests for service is physician-led, with a physician, assisted by others, interviewing the caller and determining what type of response resource, if any, will be sent. [...] The German version of this model uses what we would recognize as 'conventional' dispatch processes, with the physician being sent to calls as requested by the EMS dispatcher.|$|E
2500|$|The aim in [...] "Scoop and Run" [...] {{treatment}} is generally {{to transport the}} patient within ten minutes of arrival, hence {{the birth of the}} phrase, [...] "the platinum ten minutes" [...] (in addition to the [...] "golden hour"), now commonly used in EMT training programs. The [...] "Scoop and Run" [...] is a method developed to deal with trauma, rather than strictly medical situations (e.g. cardiac or respiratory emergencies), however, this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>changing.</b> Increasingly, research into the management of S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) occurring outside of the hospital, or even inside community hospitals without their own PCI labs, suggests that time to {{treatment is}} a clinically significant factor in heart attacks, and that trauma patients may not be the only patients for whom 'load and go' is clinically appropriate. In such conditions, the gold standard is the door to balloon time. The longer the time interval, the greater the damage to the myocardium, and the poorer the long-term prognosis for the patient. Current research in Canada has suggested that door to balloon times are significantly lower when appropriate patients are identified by paramedics in the field, instead of the emergency room, and then transported directly to a waiting PCI lab. The STEMI program has reduced STEMI deaths in the Ottawa region by 50 per cent. In a related program in Toronto, EMS has begun to use a procedure of 'rescuing' STEMI patients from the Emergency Rooms of hospitals without PCI labs, and transporting them, on an emergency basis, to waiting PCI labs in other hospitals.|$|E
