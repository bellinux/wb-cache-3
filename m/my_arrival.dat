I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E
500|$|Around 1907, Caion's {{paper was}} hosting poems {{by the young}} Symbolist author George Bacovia (including [...] "Sonnet" [...] and [...] "Pulvis") and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel. Bacovia {{described}} their first encounter, in November 1903, as follows: [...] "Caion [...] was very depressed after his recently completed trial with Caragiale. My solitary presence, without any sort of recommendation from another author, made him receive me with significant reserve. I then communicated the purpose of <b>my</b> <b>arrival,</b> asking for the address of his collaborator, the poet Macedonski. Nevertheless, he still asked me {{for a handful of}} poems, the ones later published by his magazine." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the major}} {{disappointment}} {{of losing the}} role in The Good Earth, Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. [...] Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted {{to learn more about}} the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the San Francisco Chronicle on her departure, [...] "...for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon <b>my</b> <b>arrival,</b> I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{note was}} passed to Barkas, {{in his words}} [...] "not long after <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> in Middle East... The whole idea was there. It {{was only a matter}} of design, development, and {{arrangements}} for manufacture." [...] The first heavy wooden prototype was made in 1941 by Jasper Maskelyne, who gave it the name Sunshield. 12 men were needed to lift it, and it disintegrated on its first trial run on a Crusader tank. However, Barkas had enough confidence in the Sunshield to ask for a lighter version. The Mark 2 Sunshield was made of canvas stretched over a light steel tube frame. It was strong, light, and cheap to manufacture. And crucially, from as low as 500 feet, RAF pilots found that the Mark 2 convincingly resembled a truck.|$|E

2500|$|Of Wavell, Auchinleck wrote: [...] "In {{no sense}} do I wish to infer [...] that I found an {{unsatisfactory}} situation on <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> – far from it. Not only was I greatly {{impressed by the}} solid foundations laid by my predecessor, but I was also able the better to appreciate {{the vastness of the}} problems with which he had been confronted and the greatness of his achievements, in a command in which some 40 different languages are spoken by the British and Allied Forces." ...|$|E

[...] She replied: [...] "Let us not speak of it now, you have earned your success, which is more worthy than {{to have been born}} to it."

[...] In his prefatory letter, written from Avignon on St. Michael's Day 1337, before his return to his monastery, Guilelmus writes, [...] "And now it is fitting for me to stay for a few days more at my Lord Talleyrand de Perigord's in the Curia at Avignon, because my lord had graciously taken great pleasure from <b>my</b> <b>arrival...</b> I am sending you my little book which I put together at the insistence of my lord Cardinal...."

2500|$|In his 1938 memoirs, Dew recalled:"I {{had landed}} on July 29 by the liner Laurentic, {{arriving}} {{two days before}} the Montrose, which was already well out in the Atlantic when we first suspected that Crippen was aboard, but which was a much slower vessel than the mail steamer Laurentic. Old Crippen took it quite well. He always {{was a bit of a}} philosopher, though he could not have helped being astounded to see me on board the boat. He was quite a likeable chap in his way. Much of my time in Canada was spent evading reporters and cameramen, who knew all about <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> in spite of our efforts to keep it secret, and who frequently became personal when I did not give them a statement. As it happened, Crippen and his companion, Miss Ethel Le Neve, showed no desire to postpone our departure and waived their extradition rights, which enabled us to make the return journey after being only three weeks in Canada." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Grace's illness {{developed}} [...] "after {{sleeping in a}} damp hotel bed". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: [...] "It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> at Basingstoke {{he told me that}} he had received another chill whilst waiting at Reading Station. By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also do justice to the members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home". The [...] "damp bed" [...] story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after <b>my</b> <b>arrival,</b> Gabby {{flew the}} first F-86E to arrive on base in {{simulated}} combat {{over the field}} against an F-86A and whipped the other guy badly, with every Sabre jock on the base as witness. After he landed he briefed all pilots and announced that {{the limited number of}} E’s would be reserved for flight leaders. [...] I never forgot his response, when someone asked about the problem of wingmen staying with leaders. [...] He replied “Wingmen are to absorb firepower” and I never knew him well enough to judge whether he had a dry sense of humor, but he made the right choice. One thing I know for sure, Gabby proved himself the greatest at our skills and talents, when he added 6 ½ MIG kills to his 28 victories in WW II and become the all-time American Fighter Ace, and I MIGht [...] add, he did it in the P-47, not the better air-to-air P-51.

2500|$|In 1782 Perkins {{captured}} {{a much larger}} vessel containing several important French officers. The commander of the Jamaica station, Admiral George Rodney, promoted Perkins to master and commander of Endeavour, and added two guns to her raising her armament to fourteen guns, thus putting her on the official Navy List as a sloop-of-war. Rodney's promotion of Perkins was disallowed. Rodney wrote later to Philip Stephens, First Secretary to the Admiralty, {{in an attempt to}} confirm the promotion. [...] "I must therefore desire you will please represent to their Lordships, that on <b>my</b> <b>arrival</b> at Jamaica, I found Mr. Perkins lieutenant and commander of the Endeavour schooner – that he bore an excellent character, and had done great service." [...] Despite his request Perkins was demoted back to the rank of lieutenant and the guns ordered to be removed. At the end of the American War of Independence he was [...] "on the beach" [...] (meaning that he was without a posting on a ship) as a half-pay lieutenant.|$|E

On 15 January he again wrote, claiming that the violence committed by peasants was not political but [...] "merely the outrages of banditti" [...] which could be solved by helping Catholics of rank to preserve law and order. This could only be done by Emancipation: [...] "No time is to be lost, the business will presently be at hand, and the first step I take is of infinite importance".

But you ought to have regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to give me an honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.” ...|$|E
