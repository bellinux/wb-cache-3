50|$|The three {{horses were}} buried in a steep-walled pit of 230 cm by 240 cm. The bodies of the animals were fully decomposed, only bones and teeth remaining, but the bones were very brittle and fragile. Offerings or grave goods such as bridles were not detected. All the horses were lying on their left side, orientated in south-north direction. Their heads were placed in an upright posture on an {{elevated}} part of the pit. The middle horse was lying with its abdomen in a ventral position. The legs of the middle and eastern animal were sharply flexed. The legs of the western horse were lying in a half-extended position; it occupied {{about half of the}} pit's space. By use of a working platform, the bones were carefully exposed and soaked with cold glue, the pit was then laminated with lacquer and crêpe paper. The single bones were further secured with wires and pins. Then the pit was filled with a construction foam, secured in a wooden crate and recovered as a block. The entire object consists of a prepared sand layer of about 3 mm to 4 <b>mm</b> <b>millimeters</b> thickness with the embedded bone. The poor preservation of the bones complicated zoological investigations. The western horse was likely a mare, the others stallions. Their withers has been between 130 cm and 140 cm, which is relatively small compared to today's standards, but was average for those days. The ages of the animals have been determined between five and seven years.|$|E
