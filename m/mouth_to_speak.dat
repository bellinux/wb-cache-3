25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E

2500|$|Saw Ke became king {{due to the}} {{recommendation}} of his brother-in-law Gov. Thilawa of Yamethin. After Thado Minbya's death, Queen Saw Omma and Commander Nga Nu tried to seize the Ava throne but the court drove them out. The court initially gave the throne to Thilawa. But the taciturn governor of Yamethin refused, reportedly saying: [...] "I do not open my <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> three or four words a day. You had better choose Saw Ke." [...] The court offered the throne to Saw Ke, who accepted. He became king of Ava on 5 September 1367.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] condemns male chauvinism by {{addressing}} hurtful myths about female inferiority, with Madonna commenting on female role-playing in society. During the pre-chorus, Madonna sings: [...] "Strong inside but you don't know it / Good little girls they never show it / When you open up your <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> / Could {{you be a}} little weak?", she sings. The Village Voices Phil Dellio found the song [...] "the perfect answer record to The Virgin Suicides (where boys indeed stand {{on the side of}} the street looking uncomprehendingly on girls), thanks in no small part to the gossamer-like synthesizer percolating in the background. Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "Madonna's quasi-feminist statement," [...] while Eamon Sweeney of Hot Press noted that the song [...] "is similar in tone and texture to the Natalie Imbruglia smash ‘Smoke’." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{this high}} god should love me, should he not? He should hear my prayers {{and give me}} power--he should protect those who are dear to me. Mother, they say that you, the Mistress of secret things, can open the ears of the gods and cause their <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Mother, I command you as your Queen, call up my father Amen before me, so that I may talk with him, for I have words to which he must listen." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It hath oftentimes {{seemed to}} me," [...] said Will Scarlet, [...] "that it hath a certain motive in it, e'en such as this: That a duty which seemeth to us {{sometimes}} ugly and harsh, {{when we do}} kiss it fairly upon the <b>mouth,</b> so <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> is no such foul thing after all." ...|$|R
60|$|Well {{might he}} mumble, for {{whenever}} {{he opened his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> they crammed it with sweets.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> further, then closed it and {{for five minutes}} thought with knitted brows.|$|E

50|$|The Mooninites {{appear as}} two {{dimensional}} pixelated figures with crude eyes, eyebrows, mouths, arms and legs, all composed from basic blue rectangles. Neither Ignignokt nor Err can open their <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{but rather the}} size of the rectangle used for their <b>mouths</b> changes size <b>to</b> the rhythm of what they are saying. Ignignokt is colored with a solid shade of light green, and significantly larger than Err and has on somewhat more complex shape with several perfectly symmetrical grooves across his head. Err is light purple and square shaped with a second rectangle on his head, which fits perfectly in the groove on Ignignokt's head, which is used to form the Quad Laser and the Quad Glacier. Neither Ignignokt or Err wear clothing on a normal basis, but can be seen wearing them on occasion.|$|R
60|$|For several minutes, {{although}} he looked me {{full in the}} face, he said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his <b>mouth,</b> he condescended <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yield thee to the dog, Signore," [...] said Sigismund, {{clearing}} his <b>mouth</b> of water <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> calmly, once assured {{of his own}} burthen; [...] "trust to his sagacity, and,--God keep us in mind!--all may yet be well!" ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{the only}} time we had ever come upon the king's men in the dozen or more voyages we had made from Boston town simply through a spirit of bravado, and my heart leaped into my <b>mouth,</b> so <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> for it seemed certain we were about to be called to an {{accounting}} before having gotten well started on our first mission in behalf of the Cause.|$|R
60|$|The moment Fergus {{entered the}} hut, he looked wildly round, {{and opened his}} <b>mouth</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Then he {{suddenly}} collapsed, and fell in a heap upon the floor, scattering flakes of snow from his person in all directions.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man turned}} around angrily; opened his <b>mouth</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> and then, repenting of his purpose, faced the on-coming {{officers}} once more, much {{as if to}} say that such a question from such a questioner was not worthy of regard.|$|R

6000|$|The ladies {{looked at}} one another, and Harris said: [...] "Isn't it rather absurd to expect an {{immaterial}} <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> through a tin tube, like the grocer's boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} I {{understood}} from that Mr. Chrysostom--Cyril, {{he wants me}} to call him, but I can't quite make up my <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> it--who <b>speaks</b> English, and says he has been in England. He was telling me about it, one day when we were drying the dishes at the refectory together. He says they used to have wars and trusts and trades-unions here in the old days, just as we do now in civilized countries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (4.) There is {{faithfulness}} in callings, faithfulness to brethren, faithfulness to the world, faithfulness to children, to servants, to all, {{according to}} our place and capacity. Oh! how little of it is there found in the <b>mouths</b> and lives, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> nothing of the hearts, of professors.|$|R
5000|$|Black Angels is {{primarily}} written for (in Crumb's words) [...] "electric string quartet." [...] Though generally played by amplified acoustic instruments, {{the work is}} occasionally performed on specially constructed electronic string instruments. The music uses the extremes of the instruments' registers as well as extended techniques such as bowing on the fingerboard above the fingers and tapping the strings with thimbles. At certain points in the music, the players are even required to make sounds with their <b>mouths</b> and <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Monsieur Bardow nodded assent. He {{opened his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Suddenly his {{expression}} changed. He {{pointed to the}} door. The words came from his lips with the crisp rapidity of a repeating rifle! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Allow me,' he {{said with}} a winning smile, as Mr Gregory opened his <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> 'to take this {{opportunity}} of congratulating you on your success at the election. A narrow but well-deserved victory.' ...|$|E
60|$|A fox and a duck having quarrelled {{about the}} {{ownership}} of a frog, agreed to refer the dispute to a lion. After hearing {{a great deal of}} argument, the lion opened his <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pete Townshend, in his 2012 {{autobiography}} Who I Am, {{claimed to}} have invented {{a version of the}} Talk Box during a Who tour of the USA in 1976.

60|$|Nod {{opened his}} <b>mouth</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> and shut it again. He stared hard at those bandaged eyes. He glanced across at the black, huddling thorn-trees; at the Mountain-mulgars, going and {{returning}} with their faggots; at Thimble lying dozing in his litter. All the while betwixt finger and thumb he squeezed and pinched his Wonderstone beneath the lappet of his pocket.|$|R
500|$|Ion Storm {{contracted}} Soundelux Design Music Group {{to provide}} music for Anachronox. The firm hired Bill Brown for additional music. Tom Hall {{was impressed with}} Brown's work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game's two funk numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character {{to have their own}} theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, [...] "The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. As you get on later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal." [...] Developers integrated DirectMusic support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro <b>to</b> lip-sync animated <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> <b>spoken</b> words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive. The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because [...] "no one else got it goofy enough".|$|R
