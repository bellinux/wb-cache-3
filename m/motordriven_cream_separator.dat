40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of endowments, property rights and political conflict on the diffusion of <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> in late nineteenth century Ireland. Favourable endowments, access to finance and owner-occupancy promoted the spread of <b>cream</b> <b>separators,</b> while in areas with more small farms political conflict slowed down the diffusion of separators {{as well as of}} cooperatives. The structure of property rights and political conflict help explain why Irish agriculture was less successful than Danish agriculture during this period...|$|R
25|$|The {{third major}} {{industry}} in West Chester {{in the late}} 1800s was the Sharples Separator Works. Philip M. Sharples built a shop in April 1881 and built many different things made out of wood or metal such as farm machinery and steam engines. He began manufacturing <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> in 1883, which became his most profitable product. In 1889, he {{moved into a new}} factory on Maple Avenue that eventually employed 600 workers and produced 3,700 <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> annually. After being sued in 1893, Sharples acquired a patent for his <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> in 1897. Sharples added innovations like electric lighting, fire alarms, and steam whistles and helped transform West Chester into a major industrial hub. By the 1900 census, West Chester's population had expanded to 9,524 and was the largest town in Chester County with approximately 10 percent of its population.|$|R
50|$|His {{interests}} {{extended to}} agriculture. He imported the first <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> into Queensland (possibly {{the first in}} Australia) and he build the first silo in Gympie.|$|R
50|$|Lisle {{was founded}} in 1903 by C.A. Lisle, {{originally}} manufacturing horse-powered water well drilling machines. Later, Lisle made washing machines, <b>cream</b> <b>separators,</b> and reel lawn mowers.|$|R
50|$|The Pioneer factory was {{the first}} in Australia to use the <b>cream</b> <b>separators.</b> The machine was of Danish {{manufacture}} and it was introduced following a tour of Europe and the United States by Mr. D. L. Dymock who had been supported financially by local dairy farmers. The <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> arrived in Australia on the SS Chimbarazo which docked in Sydney Harbour. Two separators were purchased on the trip, with the other destined for use at the other factory owned by the Fresh Food and Ice Company.|$|R
50|$|From the 1870s Gustaf de Laval (1845-1913) {{developed}} {{machines for}} the dairy industry, {{including the first}} centrifugal milk-cream separator and early milking machines. His first separator was patented in 1887, and his first milking machine in 1894. From the early 1880s, De Laval's <b>cream</b> <b>separator,</b> was promoted internationally. For example, the London-based Dairy Supply Co presented the <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> at the 1891 Dairy Show in London.In 1883, DeLaval and Oscar Lamm founded Aktiebolaget Separator (abbreviated to AB Separator) in Stockholm, Sweden. In the first year the company built 53 milk separators, of which 37 were exported. In 1888 in the US the company founded the De Laval <b>Cream</b> <b>Separator</b> Co. as a subsidiary, with a sales office in New York and production facility in Poughkeepsie, New York. Another company that Gustaf de Laval founded in the United States in 1901 was the De Laval Steam Turbine Company in Trenton.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from this}} invention, Wiberg invented {{numerous}} other devices and gadgets, among these a <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> and a pulse jet engine. None {{of these were}} commercially successful.|$|R
50|$|Miele's first {{products}} were a <b>cream</b> <b>separator,</b> butter churn, and tub washing machine, under the Meteor brand. Carl Miele supervised manufacturing personally, and Reinhard Zinkann apprenticed and handled finances and sales.|$|R
5000|$|In 1889 Robert {{acquired}} the UK rights to manufacture and sell Danish engineer Mikael Pedersen's new <b>cream</b> <b>separator,</b> which through a spinning centrifugal separator allowed {{the machine to}} run at a constant speed and hence create a regular consistency of cream. Marketed in the UK and British Empire as [...] "The Alexandra Cream Separator", its success resulted in Pedersen moving to Dursley. In 1899, he founded the Dursley Pedersen Cycle Company with Ashton Lister. Robert was a pioneer of business in Western Canada, and took the first <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> in that region over the plains of Alberta in a journey made by horse buggy.|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, R.A. Listers had {{redesigned}} Pedersen's <b>cream</b> <b>separator,</b> expanded its lines of sheep shearing machinery, was producing milk churns and wooden barrels for butter, {{and from the}} off-cuts developed a successful line of wood-based garden furniture.|$|R
5000|$|Centrifugal <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> {{allow the}} {{properties}} of centrifuge {{to be applied to}} butter making. Instead of having spinning paddles, the paddles are fixed and the container spins. This allows better separation of the butter from the buttermilk and water.|$|R
50|$|In the Pialba {{district}} in the 1890s <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> were too expensive for individual farmers to buy, {{and as a result}} a creamery opened at Aalborg (named after the town in Denmark, now known as Nikenbah). Creameries separated the cream from milk, so the cream could then be sent to a butter factory, and the farmers could take the remaining skim milk home to feed to their calves or pigs. Due to this process pig farming became a common adjunct to dairy farming. In 1901 a butter factory opened at Maryborough and Pialba farmers were able to buy their own <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> from the factory, on credit against future payments for their cream.|$|R
50|$|He {{went to the}} Paris Exhibition of 1867 with {{an exhibit}} of his father's firm's machinery. In the same year he started {{business}} for himself, founding R A Lister and Company to produce agricultural machinery. The principal products were <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> and other dairy and sheep shearing machinery, petrol, oil and gas engines, tractors, tractor ploughs and automatic electric lighting plants. Lister travelled extensively to promote his company's products. He was a pioneer of business in Western Canada by taking the first <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> in that region over the plains of Alberta. In 1900 he had many interviews with Dominion Ministers including Wilfrid Laurier and was asked to give evidence before the Tariff Revising Committee.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> into Australia by Mr. D.L.

A {{discussion}} {{of the results of the}} tests of the Alpha and United States <b>cream</b> <b>separators.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: In the thesis, submitted by Mr. L. W.

Mr. Waldraven’s thesis also contains notes and full explanations of how the experiments were conducted, power measured and the apparatus used. But it is considered not superfluous to repeat that the greatest care was taken to have the conditions the same for the two machines, even to the same number of drops of oil used, per minute, in each case. In the following graphical representation of the power required by the two separators, the averages of all the tests made on each separator are the results plotted...|$|R

50|$|There are 3 {{types of}} {{centrifuge}} designed for different applications. Industrial scale centrifuges {{are commonly used}} in manufacturing and waste processing to sediment suspended solids, or to separate immiscible liquids. An example is the <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> found in dairies. Very high speed centrifuges and ultracentrifuges able to provide very high accelerations can separate fine particles down to the nano-scale, and molecules of different masses.|$|R
50|$|The Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory {{was erected}} in 1883 and later officially opened on 18 June 1884 in Kiama, New South Wales. It is {{credited}} with being the first factory in Australia to use <b>cream</b> <b>separators,</b> a machine that would transform processing techniques in the dairy industry. The Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory {{was also the first}} factory in Australia to make a shipment of butter to Great Britain.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{centrifugal separation}} method, at various separation temperatures and feed rates, {{was employed to}} fractionate milk and cream {{on the basis of}} fat globule size. It involved a modified and a conventional centrifugal separation in first and second stages, respectively. In the first stage, two streams of milk: one rich in larger fat globules and another rich in smaller fat globules, were obtained by fractionation in a modified <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> In the second stage, the two streams from the first stage were each further fractionated in a conventional <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> Depending on the temperature and feed rate of the first stage, this double separation method was able to create streams with mean fat globule size (D [4, 3]) as small as 1. 35  μm and as large as 4. 28  μm without affecting the droplet integrity. The developed method has potential for size-based fractionation of native fat globules in industrial scale.

5000|$|Very few {{rules were}} ever {{adopted by the}} {{community}} as Malcolm Terence notes: [...] "Anarchists are good at lots of things but making rules isn’t one of them." [...] After a hepatitis epidemic, they banned sitting on the kitchen counter, and they also banned turning the handle on the <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> [...] "because it used to drive people crazy when people {{would sit in the}} kitchen and play with the handle on the cream separator".|$|R
50|$|By 1936 Lister was {{producing}} 600 engines across {{a range of}} 80 different sizes and types of diesel and petrol models, most of which were small at around 1.5 to 3 hp. These could be bought stand alone (many were used in the construction industry), or powering a complementary range of pumps, churns, <b>cream</b> <b>separators,</b> autotrucks, generating plant and sheep shearing equipment. The branded Woodware Works continued to produce ornamental tubs, garden seats and other ornamental garden furniture.|$|R
50|$|Dairy {{products}} have long formed {{the backbone of}} Ireland's agricultural sector. In the early 19th century, the country was amongst the world's largest producers of dairy products. In 1848, Ireland accounted for two thirds of butter imports into the port of London. Irish butter came under pressure by competitors which were modernising their systems with the newly developed <b>cream</b> <b>separators.</b> As a consequence, Irish butter imports to London dropped to under one per cent in the early 1880s.|$|R
50|$|Sharples Separator Works, {{also known}} as the Gumas Warehouse and Kauffman Warehouse, is a {{historic}} factory complex located in West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The complex was built between 1890 and 1909, and includes 14 contributing buildings. They range between one and three stories, are of brick construction, and have low pitched gable roofs or hipped roofs. It was home to the manufacturing works for the Sharples Tubular Centrifugal Separator, the first American invented <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dairy {{products}} are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized fresh cream is called sweet cream butter. Production of sweet cream butter first became {{common in the}} 19th century, {{with the development of}} refrigeration and the mechanical <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a shelf life of roughly ten days.|$|R
25|$|He took {{a leading}} part in {{developing}} agricultural co-operation, {{of which he}} had learned from isolated American farmers, taking account of Scandinavian models of co-operation and the invention of the steam-powered <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> Working with a few colleagues, including two members of the clergy, and advocating self-reliance, he set his ideas into practice first among dairy farmers in the south of Ireland, who established Ireland's first cooperative at Doneraile, County Cork. He also opened the first creamery in Dromcollogher, County Limerick.|$|R
