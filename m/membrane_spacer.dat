40|$|We {{demonstrated}} forward osmosis (FO) membrane integrity loss during gypsum scaling {{with the}} presence of <b>membrane</b> <b>spacer.</b> The gypsum scalant had preferential accumulation adjacent to <b>membrane</b> <b>spacer</b> where the needle-shape gypsum potentially compromised polyamide thin-film composite FO membrane integrity. However, the loss of FO membrane integrity cannot be sensitively detected by in situ measurements of membrane water and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficients. We, for the first time, employed membrane integrity challenge tests to reveal the impaired FO membrane integrity by fluorescent Rhodamine WT tracer and amine-modified latex nanoparticles, respectively. Challenge tests using Rhodamine WT tracer showed that membrane log removal value decreased to 3. 5 after three scaling–cleaning cycles, which corresponded to a pinhole size of 0. 06 μm 2 on the FO membrane. This result was further corroborated by challenge test using latex nanoparticle where the particle size distribution in the permeate became wider and the average particle size increased over the three scaling–cleaning cycles. Both challenge tests were sensitive enough to identify impaired FO membrane integrity. Results reported here have significant implications for achieving better <b>membrane</b> <b>spacer</b> and module design, as well as demanding periodical monitoring of FO membrane integrity in water reuse...|$|E
40|$|Many {{membrane}} {{processes are}} severely influenced by concentration polarisation. Turbulence promoting spacers placed {{in between the}} membranes can reduce the diffusional resistance of concentration polarisation by inducing additional mixing. Electrodialysis (ED) used for desalination suffers from concentration polarisation in particular. Using spacers there leads to higher cell resistance, and therefore to higher power consumption, because of the induction of the spacer shadow effect: ions do not migrate {{in areas where the}} spacer is located. The use of ion-conductive spacers can reduce this spacer shadow effect, however the spacers are still rather thick and the cell resistance stays high. This work tries to overcome the disadvantages of thick spacers while keeping the beneficial effect of turbulence promotion. We present the preparation and characterisation of a novel cation exchange membrane where the spacer is formed directly on the membrane surface and is hence integral part of the membrane. This membrane with integrated spacer is formed by surface patterning of a drying polymer solution in contact with a regular <b>membrane</b> <b>spacer</b> where capillary forces pull the solution towards the spacer strands where they solidify. Peeling of the original spacer leaves the membrane with the spacer topology integrated in its surface. Characterisation of this novel membrane in an ED process improves process hydrodynamics while avoiding the resistance increase corresponding to the shadow effect of a non-conductive spacer. Having a spacer directly on the membrane surface has also the advantage of a much simpler membrane module assembly since the spacer becomes superfluou...|$|E

The C gamma 3 coding region, typical of other IgGs, is divided into six exons corresponding to the protein domains (C gamma (3) 1, hinge, C gamma (3) 2, and C gamma (3) 3) and to the membrane carboxyl terminus (M 1 and M 2). The predicted amino acid sequence of the gamma 3 chain has three potential N-linked carbohydrate addition sites (including one in the <b>membrane</b> <b>spacer</b> segment), as compared with a single occurrence in the other mouse IgGs. Between the switch recombination region and the body of the C gamma 3 gene, there is a remarkable homology with a sequence between C mu and C delta which provides a rationale for an alternative, T cell-independent class-switch mechanism. We have used a computer to analyze the secondary structure of the gamma 3 mRNA precursor for the membrane form. We predict that this RNA precursor (approximately 12 000 bp) folds into four leaf-like domains which correspond to the variable region, the large IVS, the body of the constant region, and the membrane exons.

40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the initial}} deposition on <b>membrane</b> <b>spacers</b> of colloidal size particles immersed in a liquid is investigated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The ability of this method to model surface interactions allows the modelling of aggregation and deposition at the particle scale. The numerical model adopts a mechanistic approach to represent the forces involved in colloidal suspension by including near wall drag retardation, surface interaction and Brownian forces. The model is implemented using commercially available software, so that results can be replicated in a standard and user-friendly framework. The effect of different spacer orientation with respect to feed direction is examined and results show that deposition of particles is increased around the spacer joints when feed orientation bisects the spacers' angle; {{when one of the}} spacer filaments is aligned with the feed inflow deposition occurs exclusively and uniformly on it.

The fouling propensity of modified and unmodified <b>membranes</b> and <b>spacers</b> was evaluated by continuous biofouling experiments in a membrane fouling simulator. The {{goals of the}} study were: 1) to determine the effectiveness of polydopamine and polydopamine- g-poly(ethylene glycol) membrane coatings for biofouling control and 2) to compare techniques commonly used in assessment of membrane biofouling propensity with biofouling experiments under practical conditions. Short-term adhesion tests were carried out under static, no-flow conditions for 1 h using bovine serum albumin, a common model globular protein, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common model Gram-negative bacterium. Biofouling tests were performed in a membrane fouling simulator (MFS) for several days under flow conditions similar to those encountered in industrial modules with the autochthonous drinking water population and acetate dosage as organic substrate. Polydopamine- and polydopamine- g-poly(ethylene glycol) -modified membranes showed significantly reduced adhesion of bovine serum albumin and P. aeruginosa in the short-term adhesion tests, but no reduction of biofouling was observed during longer biofouling experiments with modified <b>membranes</b> and <b>spacers.</b> These results demonstrate that short-term batch adhesion experiments using model proteins or bacteria under static conditions are not indicative of biofouling, while continuous biofouling experiments showed that membrane surface modification by polydopamine and polydopamine- g-poly(ethylene glycol) is not effective for biofouling control. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The comfort within {{residential}} buildings is often related to indoor climate conditions. However, sufficient air quality {{can only be}} guaranteed if ventilation rates exceed minimum standards. In most cases this is realized by window ventilation, a process accompanied by a tremendous loss of energy. Applying modern building ventilation systems instead, is a promising approach to reduce losses and enhance sustainability. The reason is that building ventilation systems make use of energy recovery devices. In air-to-air heat exchangers, discharged and fresh air get in contact via impermeable exchanger plates. Here, energy recovery is limited to sensible heat. Substituting the exchanger plates with water vapor permeable membranes makes the device also capable of recovering latent heat (in terms of water vapor). Such devices are called membrane-based enthalpy exchangers. Efficiency is typically a function of fluid dynamics, material properties and process parameters. The scope of this thesis is to describe the governing parameters, identify transport limitations and point out potential solutions to successfully tackle such limitations. First, the influence of vapor activity on membrane permeance was evaluated for different materials. Single-gas measurements proved that permeance is a strong function of both feed and permeate activity. Depending on the polymer of the selective layer, a change in activity either enhanced or reduced membrane permeance. In complementary mixed-gas measurements the overall transport resistance (including boundary layer and membrane support) was deconvoluted in detail. While {{the impact of the}} support changed with the membrane sample, the boundary layer had a similar effect regardless of the material. Performance loss due to the stagnant boundary layers was successfully minimized by application of so-called <b>membrane</b> <b>spacers.</b> Finally, a commercial software (Aspen Custom Modeler®) was used to model the heat and mass transfer in membrane-based enthalpy exchangers. By means of model predictions it was possible to identify the economic limits of material optimization. An optimization beyond this limit will only make sense if the impact of the stagnant layer is reduced simultaneously. A case study revealed that the actual saving potential of <b>membrane</b> <b>spacers</b> depends on multiple parameters like outer climate conditions, energy prices and the humidification technology of the corresponding building ventilation system. Even though the focus of the study is on membrane-based enthalpy exchangers, results and experimental approaches can be useful for many other applications like technical (de) hydration processes and the optimization of functional clothing. In addition upcoming material developments might boost the impact of boundary layers in gas permeation processes not related to water vapor. If so, the findings of this thesis will help to identify and overcome transport limitations of these applications, too...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of an amphiphilic copolymer coating on biofilm formation and biofouling control. The coating was composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and perfluorodecyl acrylate (PFA), respectively. Commercial RO membranes were coated with HEMA-PFA copolymer film. Long and short term biofouling studies with coated and uncoated <b>membranes</b> and feed <b>spacer</b> were performed using membrane fouling simulators (MFSs) operated in parallel, fed with water containing nutrients.

The presence of the membrane coating was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results showed that the amphiphilic coating (i) delayed biofouling (a lower pressure drop increase by a factor of 3 and a lower accumulated active biomass amount by a factor of 6), (ii) influenced the biofilm composition (23 % lower polysaccharides and 132 % higher protein content) and (iii) was still completely present on the membrane at the end of the biofouling study, showing that the coating was strongly attached to the membrane surface.

These self-standing membranes with straight-ridge, wave and pillar structures as well as similarly prepared flat membranes were installed on the river water side in a RED stack (where electrical resistance is the highest). 38 % higher gross power density and 20 % higher net power density were achieved with the pillar-structured membranes when compared to that of flat <b>membranes</b> with <b>spacers.</b> Further optimization of the structure geometry in combination with the possibility to cast membranes of different chemistries offer a huge potential for further development of homogeneous membranes with the desired electrochemical and physical properties, which could provide high power densities in RE...|$|R
40|$|Salinity Gradient Power via Reverse Electrodialysis is a {{topic of}} primary {{importance}} nowadays. It allows to get energy from the “controlled” mixing of solutions at different salt concentration. The performance of this technology depends on many factors such as: components properties (i. e. <b>membranes,</b> <b>spacers,</b> electrodes), stack geometry, operating conditions and feeds features. Concentration polarization phenomena may significantly affect the actual membrane potential, thus reducing the gross power produced. On the other hand, C-polarization phenomena may significantly be reduced by suitably choosing the hydrodynamic regime within the stack. Such a choice may in turn significantly require higher pumping power, thus reducing the net power output. In this work, carried out within the EU-FP 7 funded REAPower project, CFD simulations were carried out in order to study the fluid flow behaviour and mass transport phenomena within spacer-filled channels for SGP-RE technology.

Biofilm measurements were performed daily, and experiments were stopped once the average PD increased to 40 mbar/cm. The results of the biofouling study showed that with increasing feed water temperature (i) the biofilm activity developed faster, (ii) the pressure drop increased faster, while (iii) the biofilm thickness decreased. At an average pressure drop increase of 40 mbar/cm over the MFS for the different feed water temperatures, different biofilm activities, structures, and quantities were found, indicating that diagnosis of biofouling of membranes operated at different or varying (seasonal) feed water temperatures may be challenging. Membrane installations with a high temperature feed water are more susceptible to biofouling than installations fed with low temperature feed water...|$|R
40|$|Renewable energy can be {{generated}} from mixing salt water and fresh water in reverse electrodialysis. The potential for energy generation from mixing seawater and river water is enormous. To investigate the effect of fouling when such natural feed waters are used, the performance of three different setups for reverse electrodialysis was evaluated for 25 days using seawater and river water as feed water, with no other (pre-) treatment than a 20 μm filter. Due {{to the absence of}} other anti-fouling treatments, a mixture of fouling is observed on the membranes, composed of remnants of diatoms, clay minerals, organic fouling and scaling. The fouling type was dependent on the different membrane types. The anion exchange membranes attract mainly diatoms and clay minerals, whereas scaling was only found on the cation exchange membranes. As a reference, plastic sheets without charge were used, which results in significant cleaner surfaces. Additionally, the setups without spacers in between the membranes (i. e. profiled membranes) appear significant less sensitive to fouling. This was quantified by the pressure drop over the feed waters and the power density obtained from the membrane piles. The pressure drop increases four times slower and the power density remains higher when profiled membranes are use instead of flat <b>membranes</b> with <b>spacers.</b> Although the obtained power density reduced with approximately 40 % in the first day under these conditions, caused by organic fouling, several strategies are available to maintain a high power output using reverse electrodialysi...|$|R
40|$|Both in {{electrodialysis}} and {{in reverse}} electrodialysis ionic shortcut currents through feed and drain channels cause a considerable loss in efficiency. Model calculations {{based on an}} equivalent electric system of a reverse electrodialysis stack reveal {{that the effect of}} these salt bridges could be reduced via a proper stack design. The critical parameters which are to be optimized are ¿/r and R/r, where ¿ is the lateral resistance along the spacers, R is the resistance of the feed and drain channels between two adjacent cells, and r is the internal resistance of a cell. Because these two parameters are dimensionless, different stacks can be easily compared. The model is validated with two experimental stacks differing in <b>membrane</b> type and <b>spacer</b> thickness, one with large ionic shortcut currents and one where this effect is less. The loss in efficiency decreased from 25 to 5 % for a well-designed stack. The loss of efficiency in reverse electrodialysis and in electrodialysis can be reduced with the aid of the design parameters presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of polydopamine- and polydopamine-. graft-poly(ethylene glycol) -coated feed <b>spacers</b> and <b>membranes,</b> copper-coated feed <b>spacers,</b> and commercially-available biostatic feed spacers on biofouling {{has been studied}} in membrane fouling simulators. Feed <b>spacers</b> and <b>membranes</b> applied in practical membrane filtration systems were used; biofouling development was monitored by feed channel pressure drop increase and biomass accumulation. Polydopamine and polydopamine-. g-PEG are hydrophilic surface modification agents expected to resist protein and bacterial adhesion, while copper feed spacer coatings and biocides infused in feed spacers are expected to restrict biological growth. Our studies showed that polydopamine and polydopamine-. g-PEG coatings on feed <b>spacers</b> and <b>membranes,</b> copper coatings on feed spacers, and a commercial biostatic feed spacer {{did not have a}} significant impact on feed channel pressure drop increase and biofilm accumulation as measured by ATP and TOC content. The studied <b>spacer</b> and <b>membrane</b> modifications were not effective for biofouling control; it is doubtful that feed <b>spacer</b> and <b>membrane</b> modification, in general, may be effective for biofouling control regardless of the type of applied coating. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>membrane</b> technology requires <b>spacers</b> that can significantly enhance the mass-transfer rate while avoiding a severe pressure drop across the membrane module. A potential {{solution to this}} challenge is to introduce some flexible and dynamic structures into the spacer mesh. The current work was motivated to explore a conceptual design of spacers with hairy structures. The hairy structures were simulated using highly flexible nylon fibers that were fixed on a well-designed framework. The effects of fiber asymmetry and spacing on the vibrations were {{discussed in terms of}} the observations via a high speed camera. A variety of spacer prototypes were employed in a forward osmosis process to examine the performance of the hairy structures. The experimental results indicate that fiber vibrations could have a great impact on the mass transfer {{in the vicinity of the}} membrane surface and enhance the filtration flux (up to ~ 20 %). This fundamental study not only provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the complex fiber-flow interactions but also charts the direction for future hairy spacer design...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatially}} heterogeneous {{distribution of}} biofouling in spiral wound membrane systems restricts (i) the water distribution over the membrane surface and therefore (ii) the membrane-based water treatment. The {{objective of the}} study was to assess the spatial heterogeneity of biofilm development over the membrane fouling simulator (MFS) length (inlet and outlet part) at three different cross-flow velocities (0. 08, 0. 12 and 0. 16 m/s). The MFS contained sheets of <b>membrane</b> and feed <b>spacer</b> and simulated the first 0. 20 m of spiral-wound membrane modules where biofouling accumulates the most in practice. In-situ non-destructive oxygen imaging using planar optodes was applied to determine the biofilm spatially resolved activity and heterogeneity. Comparison of the inlet and outlet position of the MFS showed a more (i) heterogeneous biofilm distribution and a (ii) higher biological activity at the inlet side (first 2. 5 cm) for all cross-flow velocities. The lowest cross-flow velocity had the highest biomass activity particularly at the inlet side. A better characterization of biofilm development, including the factors that influence the biofilm spatial heterogeneity in membrane systems with time, may help to develop effective strategies for biofouling control in membrane systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{diversity}} and the phylogenetic affiliation of bacteria in a biofouling layer on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were determined. Fresh surface water {{was used as a}} feed in a membrane-based water purification process. Total DNA was extracted from attached cells from feed <b>spacer,</b> RO <b>membrane</b> and product <b>spacer.</b> Universal primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. The biofilm community was analysed by 16 S rRNA-gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the phylogenetic affiliation was determined by sequence analyses of individual 16 S rDNA clones. Using this approach, we found that five distinct bacterial genotypes (Sphingomonas, Beta proteobacterium, Flavobacterium, Nitrosomonas and Sphingobacterium) were dominant genera on surfaces of fouled RO membranes. Moreover, the finding that all five ¿key players¿ could be recovered from the cartridge filters of this RO system, which cartridge filters are positioned before the RO membrane, together with literature information where these bacteria are normally encountered, suggests that these microorganisms originate from the feed water rather than from the RO system itself, and represent the fresh water bacteria present in the feed water, {{despite the fact that the}} feed water passes an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane (pore size approximately 40 nm), which is able to remove microorganisms to a large extent...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{conventional}} chemical treatment on initiation and spatiotemporal development of biofilms on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes {{was investigated in}} situ using flow cells placed in parallel with the RO system of a full-scale water treatment plant. The flow cells got the same feed (extensively pre-treated fresh surface water) and operational conditions (temperature, pressure and membrane flux) as the full-scale installation. With regular intervals both the full-scale RO membrane modules and the flow cells were cleaned using conventional chemical treatment. For comparison some flow cells were not cleaned. Sampling was done at different time periods of flow cell operation (i. e., 1, 5, 10 and 17 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months). The combination of molecular (FISH, DGGE, clone libraries and sequencing) and microscopic (field emission scanning electron, epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy) techniques {{made it possible to}} thoroughly analyze the abundance, composition and 3 D architecture of the emerged microbial layers. The results suggest that chemical treatment facilitates initiation and subsequent maturation of biofilm structures on the RO <b>membrane</b> and feed-side <b>spacer</b> surfaces. Biofouling control might be possible only if the cleaning procedures are adapted to effectively remove the (dead) biomass from the RO modules after chemical treatmen...|$|R
