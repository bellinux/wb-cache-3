25|$|For {{reasons that}} are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she {{is to have a}} <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> naturally.

25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus.

25|$|A <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> is the {{culmination}} of one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter, and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the increase in}} risk of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> associated with ovulation induction and calculated the proportion of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> attributable to this treatment. METHODS: Cases were 350 <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and controls were 737 single births enrolled from April 1993 to March 1994 in the Mercurio Project, an investigation of reproductive outcomes in Italy. RESULTS: Ovulation induction was used in 45 case births (12. 9 %) and 24 control births (3. 3 %); the adjusted odds ratio was 4. 1 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 4, 6. 9). The odds ratio for triplet or higher order births was 72. 2 (95 % CI = 25. 7, 202. 8). When unlike-sexed <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> were considered, the odds ratio increased for twin births, but not for triplet or higher births. The highest odds ratios were found when ovulation induction was used with assisted reproduction. The proportion of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> attributable to ovulation induction was 9. 7 % overall, 5. 4 % for twin births, and 69. 8 % for triplet or higher births. CONCLUSIONS: Ovulation induction {{increases the risk of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and has been responsible for the rise in the rate of triplet or higher order births in Italy in the last decade. Its indiscriminate and improper use should be avoided...|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} {{multiple}} births has {{increased over the}} last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably {{be attributed to the}} impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by intrauterine insemination, are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.|$|E
25|$|Recently, new {{findings}} have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of teratogenicity. Cereblon is a 51 kDa protein localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous {{parts of the}} body. It acts {{as a component of}} the E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating various developmental processes, including embryogenesis, carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation, through degradation (ubiquitination) of unknown substrates. Thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon, inhibiting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in accumulation of the ligase substrates and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and FGF10. This disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors, possibly causing both <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> defects and anti-myeloma effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of selecting only one embryo {{to transfer to}} the woman is called elective-single embryo transfer (e-SET) or, when embryos are at the blastocyst stage, {{it can also be}} called elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT). It significantly lowers the risk of multiple pregnancies, compared with e.g. Double Embryo Transfer (DET) or double blastocyst transfer (2BT), with a twinning rate of approximately 3.5% in sET compared with approximately 38% in DET, or 2% in eSBT compared with approximately 25% in 2BT. At the same time, pregnancy rates is not significantly less with eSBT than with 2BT. That is, the cumulative live birth rate associated with single fresh embryo transfer followed by a single frozen and thawed embryo transfer is comparable with that after one cycle of double fresh embryo transfer. Furthermore, SET has better outcomes in terms of mean gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, and risk of neonatal intensive care unit necessity than DET. e-SET of embryos at the cleavage stage reduces the likelihood of live birth by 38% and <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> by 94%. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that increasing the number of e-SET attempts (fresh and/or frozen) results in a cumulative live birth rate similar to that of DET.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Prevailing {{hypotheses}} {{about the causes}} of ovarian carcinogenesis predict that women with a history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> (twins, triplets, etc.) should be at increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the scant available evidence suggests that they may actually be at lower risk. To resolve this issue, we pooled data from eight studies involving 2859 parous women with epithelial ovarian cancer (case patients) and 7434 parous women without ovarian cancer (control women). In addition to assessing their history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> (and the sex of the children, where available), we obtained information on age, parity, oral contraceptive use, and other reproductive factors for each woman. Details of tumor histology were available for all case patients. We estimated the relative risks of various histologic types of ovarian cancers associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> by using multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for matching and confounding variables. RESULTS: Among these parous women, 73 case patients (2. 6 %) and 257 control women (3. 5 %) had a history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> The adjusted summary odds ratio (OR) for developing all types of epithelial ovarian cancer that are associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> was 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 61 - 1. 08). We found no evidence that risks associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> differed among women with borderline or invasive tumors and among women with same-sex and opposite-sex offspring from <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> The risk reductions appeared specific for nonmucinous tumors (n = 2453; summary adjusted OR = 0. 71 [95 % CI = 0. 52 - 0. 98]); in contrast, associations with mucinous tumors (n = 406) were heterogeneous across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Parous women with nonmucinous ovarian cancer are no {{more likely to have a}} history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> than other parous women, counter to the predictions of current hypotheses for causes of ovarian cancer...|$|R

[...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number.

Results Children born <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> were {{more than twice as likely}} to die during infancy as infants born singleton (hazard ratio = 2. 19; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 50, 3. 19) holding other factors constant.

Conclusion <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> are strongly negatively associated with infant survival in Nigeria independent of other risk factors. Mother's education played a protective role against infant death. This evidence suggests that improving maternal education may be key to improving child survival in Nigeria.
