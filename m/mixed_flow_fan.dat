40|$|A Study Of Shock Analysis Using The Finite Element Method Verified With Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory; Mechanical Effects Due To Pulse Width Variation Of Shock Inputs; And Evaluation Of Shock Response Of A <b>Mixed</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Fan</b> David Jonathan González Campos For many {{engineers}} {{that use}} {{finite element analysis}} or FEA, {{it is very important}} to know how to properly model and obtain accurate solutions for complicated loading conditions such as shock loading. Transient acceleration loads, such as shocks, are not as common as static loads. Analyzing these types of problems is less understood, which is the basis for this study. FEA solutions are verified using classical theory, as well as experimental results. The complex loading combination of shock and high speed rotation is also studied. Ansys and its graphic user interface, Workbench Version 14. 5, are the programs used to solve these types of problems. Classical theory and Matlab codes, as well as experimental results, are used to verify finite element solutions for a simple structure, such as a cantilevered beam. The discrepancy of these FEA results is found to be 2. 3 %. The Full Method and the Mode Superposition Method in Ansys are found to be great solution tools for shock loading conditions, including complex acceleration and force conditions. The Full Method requires less pre-processing but solutions could take days, as opposed to hours, to complete in comparison with the Mode Superposition Method, depending on the 3 D Model. The Mode Superposition Method requires more time and input by the user but solves relatively quickly. Furthermore, a new representation of critical pulse width of the shock inputs is presented. Experimental and finite element analyses of a complete <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> undergoing ballistic shock is also completed; deformation results due to shock loading, combined with rotation and aerodynamic loading, account for 32. 3 % of the total deformation seen from experimental testing. Solution methods incorporated in Ansys, and validation of FEA results using theory, have great potential implications as powerful tools for engineering students and practicing engineers...|$|E

The nozzle vane ring was matched to the 3 -dimensional {{aspect of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> rotor leading edge with lean stacking. It was found that for a nozzle vane ring in a volute, the vane surface pressure is highly affected by the flow in the volute rather than the adjacent vane surface interactions, especially at closer nozzle positions. The performance of the VG <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> turbine shows higher peak efficiency and swallowing capacity at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent straight vane arrangement shows a higher swallowing capacity but similar efficiencies. The VG turbine unsteady performance was found to deviate substantially from the quasi-steady assumption compared to a nozzleless turbine. This is more evident in the higher vane angle settings (smaller nozzle passage), where there are high possibility of choking during a pulse cycle.

40|$|To {{maintain}} the production timing, productivity, and product quality of plant factories, {{it is necessary}} to keep the growth environment uniform.

40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} a new {{algorithm}} for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics of fluids under planar <b>mixed</b> <b>flow,</b> a linear combination of planar elongational flow and planar Couette flow. To date, {{the only way of}} simulating <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics techniques was to impose onto the simulation box irreversible transformations. This would bring the simulation to an end as soon as the minimum lattice space requirements were violated. In practical terms, this meant repeating the short simulations to improve statistics and extending the box dimensions to increase the total simulation time. Our method, similar to what has already been done for pure elongational flow, allows a cuboid box to deform in time following the streamlines of the <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> and, after a period of time determined by the elongational field, to be mapped back and recover its initial shape. No discontinuity in physical properties is present during the mapping and the simulation can, in this way, be extended indefinitely. We also show that the most general form of <b>mixed</b> <b>flow,</b> in which the angle between the expanding (or contracting) direction and the velocity gradient axis varies, can be cast in a so-called canonical form, in which the angle assumes values that are multiples of π (when a <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> exists), by an appropriate choice of the field parameters...|$|R

40|$|The cross <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> {{consists}} of a cylindrical rotor closed at the ends with a cascade of axial blades around its curved surface. The rotor is mounted in a housing which defines the suction and discharge arcs. The housing extends {{the full length of}} the rotor and the throughflow is in a plane at right angles to the rotor axis. This fan is a unique type of turbo-machine which differs significantly from axial <b>flow,</b> centrifugal and <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> machines, in that each blade passage experiences a continuosly varying flow each time it makes a revolution through the flow field. In this thesis, experimental results are presented which describe the internal flow regime of a large cross <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> of rotor length 1. 0 m and outside diameter 0, 625 m. Details of the flow field are examined for a range of dimensionless flow coefficient Ф between 0, 4 and 0. 8, which is taken to be the usual operating range for reasons of efficiency and stability of flow. The measurements are transformed into streamlines for the purpose of illustration and the corresponding variations of a dimensionless total pressure coefficient are also given. Flow visualization techniques have been applied to a dynamically similar model to a reduced scale of 1 : 6. 25 operating in water and photographs representing the flow have been examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. A Rankine-type vortex centered near the inner periphery is confirmed but the core was found to remain virtually stationary over the flow range investigated. The total pressure distribution indicates the spatial growth and weakened circulation of the forced vortex core as the flow rate reduces. A depression of total pressure has been identified in a region diametrically opposite the vortex core which intensifies as the flow rate increases. These data are broadly interpreted and are used to improve a previous theoretical model, in which the location of the vortex is used to define the operating point on the fan characteristic...|$|R

For blade hub, more loading in posterior area should be chosen, while for blade tip more loading in frontal area of the blade is available. With this loading distribution, the separation flow in blade hub is controlled,along with the reduction of separation flow in blade tip.

In many instances Radial <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> are best suited. An understanding of the design and performance of these fans is therefore necessary. For radial <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> little work has been done to quantify the deviation of aerodynamic performance from that predicted by conventional fan laws. This paper aims to address this situation, by performing measurements of pressure rise, flow rate and power consumption for 3. 5 mm high radial <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> rotors ranging in diameter from 20 to 35 mm over a range of speeds. Measurements presented show variations of pressure rise and flow rate with Reynolds number to be largely in accordance with trends predicted by high Reynolds number theory, with the exception of flow rates at the lower range of Reynolds numbers which fell below the predicted values. Variations in power consumption show a similar trend to those of flow rate, with power consumption obeying the fan laws for the higher Reynolds numbers investigated, but showing a large increase at the lower Reynolds numbers.
