5|$|In 1835, still {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} activity {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company, Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was £122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to start construction, with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood. The following year Hesketh-Fleetwood and Burton oversaw the <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> of Fleetwood's first street, and the first railway lines were laid.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} Albania again became {{the cause of}} {{international}} conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever {{the results of the}} investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E

5|$|The coup-de-main {{force had}} been {{followed}} closely by the pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, tasked with <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> the drop-zones and landing-zones {{to be used by}} the rest of the division. However, due to a combination of heavy cloud cover and poor navigation, only one pathfinder team was dropped correctly. The aircraft carrying the remainder had to make between two and three runs over their respective drop-zones before their teams jumped. Pathfinders assigned to DZ N were dropped wide, and did not manage to get to the drop-zone for thirty minutes. The team assigned to DZ K accidentally dropped onto DZ N without realising their error, and set up radio beacons and markers that caused a number of airborne troops to drop in the wrong area. A pathfinder team belonging to 9th Parachute Battalion, assigned to mark out the drop-zone area for the unit tasked with destroying the Merville artillery battery, was all but wiped out when an air-raid by RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bombers missed the artillery battery itself and bombed the area the team was in.|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E

25|$|<b>Marking</b> <b>out</b> (also {{known as}} layout) {{is the process}} of {{transferring}} a design or pattern to a workpiece and {{is the first step in}} the handcraft of metalworking.

25|$|On 20 June 1832, the Regent, Peter IV of Portugal, {{elevated}} {{the settlement of}} Corvo {{to the status of}} village and municipal seat. Until this time Corvo had been under the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz das Flores, as a civil parish of its neighbor across the channel. And after 1853, the foral (the town's royal charter) granted to the dual jurisdiction was extinguished, resulting in a liberal movement, where tenant farmers were able to raise their cattle and till their own lands, <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> a subsistence economy that supported porting ships.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{friction}} between the Western Allies and Soviets was steadily rising. The Soviets even took to <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> their border by stationing armed soldiers along it at intervals of a few metres, day and night, in all weathers. Since there was not, as yet, a fixed marker, the borders were prone to abuse, which eventually resulted (in August 1948), in white lines in luminous paint appearing across roads and even through ruined buildings to try to deter the Soviets from making unauthorised incursions into the American and British zones. These measures were only partially successful: after further skirmishes in which shots were fired, barbed wire entanglements were stretched across some roads, a foretaste of things to come.|$|E
25|$|Sometime between 836 and 839, Alexios {{was engaged}} to the princess Maria, Emperor Theophilos's {{youngest}} and favourite daughter, {{despite the fact that}} she was an infant. Theophilos had no male heir at the time, and this move was evidently intended as <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> Alexios as his heir apparent. He was progressively promoted to patrikios and anthypatos, then to magistros and eventually to Caesar. He was the only person known to have been promoted to the rank during Theophilos's reign, and may indeed have been raised to it as early as 831, when the presence of an unnamed Caesar is attested at an imperial triumph. Alternatively, it may be a reference to another, otherwise unknown, holder of the title, who probably died shortly after.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the modern state lie in the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla in the Cuetlaxcoapan Valley in 1531 by Toribio de Benavente and Juan de Salmerón. The city was laid out by Hernando de Elgueta, <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> residential areas, commercial areas etc. The city received its royal seal in 1532 but flooding forced the settlement to move across the San Francisco River and start over that same year. The city’s (and now state’s) seal was granted in 1538. The city of Puebla was created to secure the route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz, and was initially populated by soldiers and those who made a living by providing shelter and supplies to travelers between the two cities. However, it soon became the economic and cultural center of the valley areas between the Valley of Mexico and the Gulf Coast, as it provided a starting point for Spanish settlement. The area’s economy expanded rapidly as many Europeans and indigenous decided to settle permanently, with the settlement of Puebla reaching city status in 1532 with the name of Ciudad de los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Kellex's {{design for}} K-25 {{called for a}} four-story U-shaped {{structure}} [...] long containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately {{or as part of}} a single cascade. A survey party began construction by <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> the [...] site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, Union Carbide and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480million.|$|E
500|$|The site's {{history in}} the Anglo-Saxon period begins with the {{division}} of the Isle of Thanet into eastern and western parts during the 7th century. The division is attributed in medieval sources to the route taken by a tame female deer that was set free to run across the island by Æbbe, founder and first abbess of the double monastery at Minster-in-Thanet, thereby <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> its endowment. The route was circuitous, beginning {{on the north side of}} the island at Westgate-on-Sea and ending on the south side at Sheriff's Court, halfway between Minster-in-Thanet and Monkton, which are about [...] apart. While land to the east of this route was given to Æbbe for her monastery, which was in existence by 678, land to the west, described broadly as Westanea, or [...] "the western part of the island", was given to the monastery at Reculver by King Hlothhere of Kent in 679. This division of the island is apparent in Domesday Book, which was compiled in 1086, and remained an important feature in the early 15th century, when it was included prominently in a map of the island drawn up by Thomas Elmham. According to Edward Hasted the division was still marked in 1800 by [...] "a bank, or lynch, which goes quite across the island, and is commonly called St. Mildred's lynch." ...|$|E
