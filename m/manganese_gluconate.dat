40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} physical and chemical activation on the diffusion time of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (HP) bleaching agents through enamel and dentin. One hundred and twenty bovine cylindrical specimens were divided into six groups (n = 20) : 20 % HP; 20 % HP with light activation; 20 % HP with manganese gluconate; 35 % HP; 35 % HP with light activation; and 35 % HP with <b>manganese</b> <b>gluconate.</b> The specimens were fixed over transparent epoxy wells with internal cavities to simulate a pulpal chamber. This chamber was filled with an enzymatic reagent to simulate pulpal fluid. The bleaching gels were applied on enamel surface {{and the image of}} the pulpal fluid was captured by a video camera to monitor the time of peroxide penetration in each specimen. ANOVA analysis showed that concentration and type of activation of bleaching gel significantly influenced the diffusion time of HP (P < 0. 05). 35 % HP showed the lowest diffusion times compared to the groups with 20 % HP gel. The light activation of HP decreased significantly the diffusion time compared to chemical activation. The highest diffusion time was obtained with 20 % HP chemically activated. The diffusion time of HP was dependent on activation and concentration of HP. The higher concentration of HP diffused through dental tissues more quickly...|$|E
40|$|Background. Rates of iron {{deficiency}} (ID) remain high among children in Ukraine. ID contributes to burdened gastrointestinal pathology {{in children and}} adolescents, but evaluation {{of the impact of}} ID correction on the biliary tract dysfunction course is currently lacking. The objective was to determine the impact of latent ID correction on the clinical course of gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (GSOD) and iron status in schoolchildren. Materials and methods. A case-control study was conducted in 60 children aged 9 – 17 years, who had been undergoing the in-patient treatment for GSOD exacerbation and had latent ID. Children were divided into 2 groups: I — 30 patients treated with iron supplementation (50 mg elemental iron) daily for 125 days; II — 30 children having no iron supplementation. The study of anamnesis, clinical examination, complete blood count, determination of serum iron, transferrin saturation calculation, hair microelement profile evaluation, follow-up for 12 month were performed. Results. The study found that the use of iron supplement in children with GSOD and latent ID not only compensates ID in them, but also facilitates the GSOD course lowering the incidence of GSOD exacerbations by 30. 7 %. Conclusions. Latent ID correction with combined iron, copper and <b>manganese</b> <b>gluconate</b> supplement facilitates the clinical course of GSOD and improves iron status in schoolchildren...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of chemical agents to increase the bleaching effectiveness of 10 % carbamide peroxide. Two hundred and ninety enamel-dentin discs were prepared from bovine incisors. The color measurement was performed by a spectrophotometer using the CIE L*a*b*system. The groups were divided according to the bleaching treatment: negative control group (NC) : without bleaching; positive control group (PC) : bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide gel without any chemical activator; <b>Manganese</b> <b>gluconate</b> (MG); Manganese chloride (MC); Ferrous gluconate (FG); Ferric chloride (FC); and Ferrous sulphate (FS). Three different concentrations (MG, MC, FG, FC: 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 % w/w; FS: 0. 001, 0. 002 and 0. 003 % w/w) for each agent were tested. The bleaching gel was applied on the specimens for 8 h, after which they were immersed in artificial saliva for 16 h, during 14 days. Color assessments were made after 7 and 14 days. The data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's test (5 %). Generally, the test groups were unable to increase the bleaching effect (ΔE) significantly compared to the PC group. Only for ΔL, significant higher values compared to the PC group could be seen after 7 days in groups MG (0. 02 %), and FS (0. 002 and 0. 003 %). The NC group showed significantly lower values than all tested groups. It was concluded that for home bleaching procedures, the addition of chemical activators did not produce a bleaching result {{significantly higher than the}} use of 10 % carbamide peroxide without activation, and that the concentration of chemical activators used did not significantly influence the effectiveness of treatment...|$|E
40|$|CV 247 (CV), an aqueous {{mixture of}} copper (Cu) and <b>manganese</b> (Mn) <b>gluconates,</b> vitamin C and sodium {{salicylate}} increased the antitumour effects of cisplatin (CDPP; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) in vitro. We {{hypothesized that the}} antioxidant and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2; prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) inhibitory components of CV can protect the kidneys from CDPP nephrotoxicity in rats. CDPP (6. 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) slightly elevated serum creatinine (Crea) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 12 days after treatment. Kidney histology demonstrated extensive tubular epithelial damage and COX- 2 immunoreactivity increased 14 days after treatment. A large amount of platinum (Pt) accumulated in the kidney of CDPP-treated rats. Furthermore, CDPP decreased renal iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo), zinc (Zn), Cu and Mn concentrations and increased plasma Fe and Cu concentrations. CDPP elevated plasma free radical concentration. Treatment with CV alone for 14 days (twice 3 ml/kg/day orally) did not influence these parameters. Chronic CV administration after CDPP reduced renal histological damage and slightly decreased COX- 2 immunoreactivity, while failed to prevent the increase in Crea and BUN levels. Blood free radical concentration was reduced, that is, CV improved redox homeostasis. CV restored plasma Fe and renal Fe, Mo and Zn, while decreased Pt and elevated Cu and Mn concentrations in the kidney. Besides the known synergistic antitumour effects with CDPP, CV partially protected the kidneys from CDPP nephrotoxicity probably through its antioxidant effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) imaging {{studies have indicated that}} coronary occlusion does not produce sufficient changes in standard tissue relaxation times to allow the detection of acute ischemia. To identify acute myocardial perfusion abnormalities, the use of the paramagnetic agent <b>manganese</b> <b>gluconate</b> combined with calcium gluconate (MnGlu/CaGlu) was investigated in canine models of acute coronary artery occlusion. In vitro studies showed that MnGlu/CaGlu was a more efficient relaxing agent than gadolinium-DTPA (relaxivity of 7. 8 versus 5. 1 s− 1 mM− 1) and demonstrated affinity for normal myocardium. The distribution of MnGlu/CaGlu as measured by manganese- 54 tracer studies was proportional to myocardial blood flow in both normal and ischemic tissue. Hearts excised from dogs after coronary artery occlusion and administration of 0. 035 mM/kg MnGlu/CaGlu were imaged ex vivo using a relatively spin-lattice relaxation time (TI) -weighted gradient reversal technique (repetition time [TR] 50 ms and echo time [TE] 9 ms). These images showed increased signal intensity in the normally perfused myocardium with a mean signal intensity ratio of hypoperfused to normal myocardium of 0. 55 ± 0. 12 (mean ± SD). In vivo images obtained in nine dogs after coronary artery occlusion and administration of the same dose of MnGlu/CaGlu demonstrated the region of hypoperfused myocardium in six dogs with a signal intensity ratio of hypoperfused to normal myocardium of 0. 64 ± 0. 23 (p < 0. 05 versus control). When a higher dose of 0. 1 mM/kg MnGlu/CaGlu was utilized and in vivo imaging was performed using a relatively spin-spin relaxation time (T 2) -weighted (TR gated, TE 60 ms) spin-echo sequence in six dogs, the signal intensity of normal myocardium was decreased. The hypoperfused region was seen as a region of relatively higher signal in all dogs with a signal intensity ratio of hypoperfused to normal myocardium of 2. 07 ± 0. 55 (p < 0. 01 versus control). Therefore, it is concluded that NMR imaging with a manganese-containing paramagnetic contrast agent can be used to detect acute regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities...|$|E
