5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday, 15 July. Five of Slindon versus Five of Hadlow at the Artillery Ground. A return game which {{suggests}} Hadlow might {{have won the}} first as Slindon, having issued the initial challenge, <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> try for honours even. Details unknown.|$|E
25|$|ECT was not {{actually}} {{put on the}} face of the Bill, in recognition of the fact that some people thought it belonged in section 57 with irreversible treatments and a subsequent Secretary of State <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> move it there.|$|E
50|$|The reason, or reasons, for Fromm's {{dealing with}} the conspirators are unclear: He <b>might</b> have <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> cover up {{potential}} allegations that he himself was involved; also, he <b>might</b> have <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> spare his comrades a humiliating trial and possible torture. In any case, the executions did not save him.|$|R

25|$|The {{daughter}} {{was not only}} in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her {{to the service of}} a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|Separate suits {{were brought}} by the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party, {{challenging}} the validity of Ohio election laws insofar as they precluded the parties' being placed on the ballots to choose electors pledged to particular candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States; {{the attack on the}} validity of these laws was rested on the ground that they violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—on the ground that they denied plaintiffs and the voters who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> vote for them the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed against state abridgment by the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.|$|E

500|$|The Menon Constitutional Commission {{declined}} {{to recommend that}} political endorsements be prohibited, expressing the view that [...] "olitical parties {{are likely to have}} strong and potentially relevant views on the merits or demerits of Presidential candidates. The presence of an endorsement by a political party might be a factor that voters <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> consider in the exercise of their vote. The Commission also considers {{that it would not be}} feasible, in any case, to prevent endorsements by politicians speaking in their public, as opposed to personal, capacities, as it would be very difficult to distinguish between the two in practice." ...|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{wanted to}} see more action, so the creature's ability to create apparitions {{was added to the}} script from the {{original}} pitch. Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in [...] "The Man Trap" [...] could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.|$|E
500|$|... {{calls for}} {{a high level of}} expertise, so that the {{examiner}} must be well qualified and experienced in order to give effective results. In contrast to arterial ultrasonography the wall of the vein is not relevant and importance is given to the hemodynamic conclusions that the examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report. (Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow and of the laws that govern the circulation of blood in the blood vessels). It follows that the [...] examiner knowledge of venous hemodynamics is crucial, which can be a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field, who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> carry out these examinations.|$|E

50|$|Police {{officers}} are technically not employees, but crown-appointed warrant holders. This allowed the police their unique independent status and notionally provides {{the citizens of}} the UK a protection from any government that <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> unlawfully <b>to</b> use the police as an instrument against them.|$|R

500|$|The {{rules and}} {{procedures}} of the Roman Senate were both complex and ancient. Many of these {{rules and procedures}} originated {{in the early years}} of the Republic, and were upheld over the centuries under the principle of mos maiorum ("customs of the ancestors"). While Senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of the formal boundary of the city (the pomerium), no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of the [...] pomerium. Senate meetings might take place outside of the formal boundary of the city for several reasons. For example, the Senate <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> meet with an individual, such as a foreign ambassador, whom they did not wish to allow inside the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{bankrupt}} {{federal government}} was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas, who faced frequent raids by native tribes. Hoping that an influx of settlers could control the raids, in 1824 the government appointed empresarios to encourage families from the United States and Europe to settle in Texas. However, {{as the number of}} settlers from the US and other non-Spanish-speaking areas increased in Texas, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> annex the area, possibly using force. [...] On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. [...] The laws also cancelled all unfilled empresario contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties.|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, {{according}} to Fine and Manning there are [...] "remarkably few scholars who are continuing his work", nor {{has there been}} a [...] "Goffman school"; thus, his impact on social theory has been simultaneously [...] "great and modest". Fine and Manning attribute the lack of subsequent Goffman-style research and writing to the nature of his signature style, which they consider very difficult to duplicate (even [...] "mimic-proof"), and also to his writing style and subjects not being widely valued in the social sciences. With regard to his style, Fine and Manning remark that he tends to be seen either as a scholar whose style is difficult to reproduce, and therefore daunting to those who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> emulate his style, or as a scholar whose work was transitional, bridging the work of the Chicago school and that of contemporary sociologists, and thus of less interest to sociologists than the classics of either of those two groups. With regard to his subjects, Fine and Manning observe that the topic of behavior in public places is often stigmatized as being trivial, and thus unworthy of serious scholarly attention.|$|E

50|$|The strict {{limits on}} {{displacement}} forced the designers of battleships to make compromises which they <b>might</b> have <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> avoid given the choice.

2500|$|At {{the other}} pole, are those Francophone historians {{who see the}} {{positive}} benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.
