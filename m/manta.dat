5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that <b>manta</b> ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead <b>manta</b> is worth $40 to $500 while <b>manta</b> ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single <b>manta</b> ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for <b>manta</b> rays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, M. alfredi was also {{classified}} as 'Vulnerable' with local populations {{of fewer than}} 1000 individuals and little or no interchange between subpopulations. The <b>Manta</b> Trust is a UK-based charity dedicated to research and conservation efforts for <b>manta</b> rays. The organization's website is also an information resource for <b>manta</b> conservation and biology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manta</b> {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus <b>Manta</b> is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the <b>manta</b> rays, and they recommended treating <b>Manta</b> as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mantas</b> {{are found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim. Gestation lasts over a year and <b>mantas</b> give birth to live pups. <b>Mantas</b> may visit cleaning stations {{for the removal of}} parasites. Like whales, they breach, for unknown reasons.|$|R
5|$|At the 2001 competition, Amador Valley placed {{second to}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with its <b>Manta</b> Ray AUV. The <b>Manta</b> Ray weighed less than 100kg (220pounds) and {{featured}} a modular design. According to Jim Bales, technical director of the competition, the technical details of the <b>Manta</b> Ray impressed many judges and its performance surpassed a number of university teams.|$|E

5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of <b>manta</b> rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve {{well as they}} lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing <b>manta</b> ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as <b>Manta</b> fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Hawaii {{became the}} first of the United States to {{introduce}} a ban on the killing or capturing of <b>manta</b> rays. Previously, there was no fishery for mantas in the state, but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected. In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for <b>manta</b> and other rays, their retention as bycatch, and their sale.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of <b>manta</b> rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to <b>manta</b> fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where <b>manta</b> rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} <b>Manta</b> as the ransom deadline nears. The <b>Manta</b> chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E

5|$|<b>Manta</b> is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. <b>Manta</b> operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E
5|$|Sites {{at which}} <b>manta</b> rays congregate attract tourists, and <b>manta</b> viewing generates {{substantial}} annual revenue for local communities. Tourist sites {{exist in the}} Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. Mantas are popular because of their enormous size {{and because they are}} easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers may get a chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.|$|E

5|$|<b>Manta</b> {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect <b>manta</b> numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|The X-44 <b>MANTA,</b> or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on the}} F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of <b>manta</b> rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for <b>manta</b> rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting <b>manta</b> rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. <b>Manta</b> rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Ray tourism {{benefits}} {{locals and}} visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating {{them about the}} animals. It can also provide funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission. At Bora Bora, an excessive number of swimmers, boaters and jet skiers caused the local <b>manta</b> ray population to abandon the area.|$|E
