5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E
25|$|After an {{interlude}} by Mr. Hudson, furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E

500|$|The {{first book}} {{published}} by Ace {{was a pair}} of mysteries bound tête-bêche: Keith Vining's Too Hot for Hell, backed with Samuel W. Taylor's The Grinning Gismo, priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A tête-bêche book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the [...] "Ace Double" [...] format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag [...] "Complete and Unabridged" [...] on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.|$|E
500|$|To the {{immediate}} south, opposite Lone Pine, the Australian 2nd and 3rd Battalions had been digging a new trench into no man's land. It {{was intended to}} provide a better firing position and, starting from both battalions' lines, headed into no man's land at an angle of forty-five degrees to the old line. Eventually {{it was expected that}} the two extensions would <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> but {{by the time of the}} attack there was still a gap of around [...] between them. It was here the Turkish 16th Division attacked. At first the Turks were in a gully which sheltered them from Australian fire. The 48th Infantry Regiment, moving through the heavy Australian fire, advanced into the gap between the two battalions. Despite one of the 3rd Battalion's machine-guns jamming, this assault and the following waves were beaten back, although some Turks did reach the Australian trenches. The Turks came so close to the supporting Australian artillery that the artillerymen disabled their guns, so they could not be used against them, and joined the infantry in the trenches. The 16th Division attempted four successive assaults, but each wave was mown down by the Australian fire. At Wire Gully a group of Turks got close enough to a 2nd Battalion machine-gun to destroy it with a hand grenade, allowing them to move forward and reach the Australian trench. Some individual Turkish soldiers also reached the trench before they were all shot down. This continued until around 05:00, when the surviving Turks started withdrawing to German Officers' Ridge.|$|E

5000|$|Like NIF, LMJ {{intends to}} use the [...] "indirect drive" [...] approach, where the laser light is used to heat a high-Z {{cylinder}} made of some heavy metal (often gold) known as a [...] "hohlraum". The hohlraum then gives off x-rays, which are used to heat a small fuel pellet containing a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel. Although considerable laser energy is lost to heating the hohlraum, x-rays are much more efficient at heating the fuel pellet, making the indirect drive method applicable to nuclear weapons research. The x-rays rapidly heat the outer layer of the pellet so quickly that it explodes outward, causing {{the remainder of the}} pellet to be forced inward and causes a shock wave to travel <b>in</b> through <b>the</b> pellet to <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> When <b>the</b> shock wave converges from all directions and <b>meets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>the</b> density and temperature briefly reach the Lawson criterion and start fusion reactions.

2500|$|During seasons one and two, {{the opening}} {{sequence}} begins {{with images of}} Balki and Larry wiping sideways from {{opposite sides of the}} screen to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> with the series title superimposed on top.

2500|$|... "Traitor's Gate" [...] {{was written}} by Howard Brenton. He was pleased to be chosen to write the episode, as he got to write the pivotal part of the episode when Tom reveals to Ellie {{that he is a}} spy. During the writing, Brenton was simply told in a note that [...] "he tells her", and had to work out how. Brenton chose to adopt the same writing style based on the early episodes of Taggart; Brenton was {{impressed}} by the way the episodes seemed to have more to the plot half way through. The location where Tom and Salter <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the episode was to be set in the Millennium Dome; this would later change to North Greenwich tube station. The scene had to be rewritten several times to reflect Tom questioning Salter's allegiance. Much of the scene was actually automated dialogue replacement. Later on, Brenton wanted to figure out how Salter would evade Danny and Zoe; when he couldn't figure it out, he asked a source for help, who simply suggested him to have Salter call the Police about Zoe and Danny having sex in their car and there are children about. The introduction of Tessa being corrupt by running phantom agents was allegedly based in real life situations. In the series, the idea was made on the concept that MI5 officers have temptations to make money. The written scenes where Salter confesses to Tom was somewhat inspired by Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The scene was for the two to act as friends rather than interrogator and suspect.|$|E

60|$|In the pipe-fish family, too, the ardent evolutionist {{can trace}} {{a whole series}} of {{instructive}} and illustrative gradations in the development of this instinct and the corresponding pouch-like structure among the male fish. With the least highly-evolved types, like the long-nosed pipe-fish of the English Channel, and many allied forms from European seas, there is no pouch at all, but the father of the family carries the eggs about with him, glued firmly on to the service of his abdomen by a natural mucus. In a somewhat more advanced tropical kind, the ridges of the abdomen are slightly dilated, so as to form an open groove, which loosely holds the eggs, though its edges do not <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> as in the great pipe-fish. Then come yet other more progressive forms, like the great pipe-fish himself, where the folds meet so as to produce a complete sac, which opens at maturity, to let out its little inmates. And finally, in the common Mediterranean sea-horses, which you can pick up by dozens on the Lido at Venice, and a specimen of which exists in the dried form in every domestic museum, the pouch is permanently closed by coalescence of the edges, leaving a narrow opening in front, through which the small hippocampi creep out one by one as soon as they consider themselves capable of buffeting the waves of the Adriatic.|$|E
