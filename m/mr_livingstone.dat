There was a grand dinner, served in Aleck Pop's best style, and in the evening the craft was trimmed up with Japanese lanterns from end to end, and a professional orchestra of three pieces was engaged by the Rovers to furnish music for the occasion. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Livingstone</b> and his family visited the houseboat, bringing several young folks with them. The girls and boys sang, danced, and played games, while the older folks looked on.

The two questions before the District Court were, first, whether Mr Roskilly had taken all reasonable care to prevent the loss of the car and, secondly, whether he was exempt from liability by reason of the notice that was displayed in the garage workshop. The District Court Judge held that the lock on the garage door was inadequate, particularly as the key to the car was left in its ignition. Mr Roskilly was therefore held to have acted negligently. The sole question on appeal was whether the notice that was displayed in the workshop excluded Mr Roskilly's liability in negligence for the bailment of the car. The sign read: ...|$|E

50|$|Construction of the Victorian {{portion of}} the road began as early as 1925 when a bridge was built over the Buchan River at Buchan. In the 1930s {{with the use of}} {{unemployed}} labourers, improvements were made to the Buchan -Gelantipy {{portion of the}} road. Work had progressed as far as the construction of the bridge over the Suggan Buggan River at Suggan Buggan when the start of the Second World War stopped work in 1939. All of the work completed up to this point in time was done using picks and shovels, with bullock teams employed to cart away the fill. All the stonework for the culverts, pipes and embankments was constructed by hand using stone recovered during the road making process. It was not until 1960 that the Tambo and Snowy River shires managed to secure funding to complete what was described as a jeep track (that would later be upgraded) connecting the Victorian and NSW sections built before the war. A <b>Mr</b> L. <b>Livingstone</b> was contracted to undertake the Victorian portion from Suggan Buggan to Willis on the Victorian-NSW border. The job took 26 weeks to complete with the Victorians reaching the border shortly before the New South Wales construction crew. The road was opened in May 1961 by Leo Barry (Snowy River Shire) and Keith Rogers (Tambo Shire), with some 400 people in attendance. Avalanche Lookout was constructed in these works.|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] Monday night 10 / 16 / 44 My {{precious}} sweetheart, Tonight I was a {{very good}} girl, because I called your folks, and wrote letters to the following people: <b>Mrs.</b> Luddecke, Fred <b>Livingstone,</b> Lt. Lame, Al and Martha Altman, Helen and Davey, and Syl Hirshfield. Your folks are just fine, and I will probably get around to seeing them this week-end some time. Uk heard from Fred today and it seems as if he fell off the wing of a bomber and is in the hospital now. They claim he bumped his head plenty hard. Today I received a letter from Lolly which I will send you very shortly. No new outfits have moved in at Claiborne or Livingston but she says the town is still plenty crowded. Also, Mrs. Johnson gave her a letter to forward to me from the Dunn Hotel in Poplar Bluff, Mo. Seems I made a reservation for Sima and myself, but then, we found we didn’t have to stop there on the way home. Now, they sent me a bill for one night’s lodging because of the reservation, but they will have a “devil” of a time collecting! I’ll be damn[ed] if I send them $ 2. 55. Not me—unless I have to! Sent on to you Sol’s and a few other letters I have answered. Spoke to Sanf and we will probably get together the latter part of this week. Today I arrived at work at 10 a. m. Had they had my phone no. which I had neglected to give them, I would have had to be at work earlier because, all the teachers except myself and Mrs. Cox, were home with sore throats or colds. How do you like that? So, of course, between Mrs. Cox and myself we worked like a pair of mules. But, that’s the way it goes. Still am thinking about working for N. Y. C. information desk for four hrs. every night. I understand the pay is good! I shall look into it! Gosh honey, some times I get so “______lonesome” for you, I could scream. I just can’t live without you! Luckily, I adopted the attitude that every day that passes brings me one day nearer to you. I love you, my darling! For a while there I was thinking of only working part time and going back to school for 18 hrs. and getting my teacher’s certificate. However, to go to Reserve would cost me approximately $ 200. For 18 hours, and I don’t feel like spending the money. If I got to OSU, of course, there’s my expenses for living out-of-town. Nuts! Again, when the new semester starts, I’ll try and see how many night classes I can take, but damn, I dismissed college (even 18 hours) from my mind, until I get some money saved, and a free vacation out of this job! I’ve been so very busy, I don’t even have time to read. Nuts! I think of you every moment of the day, and can’t wait for that great Speerts’ Lovers’ Day when we get together. All my love all the time, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|R
