40|$|The {{present study}} assesses the spatial {{distribution}} of selected land cover classes at two years (1975 and 2000) in a Mediterranean urban area (Athens, Greece) {{to test the hypothesis}} that land cover changesdetermine an increase in the sensitivity of landscape to forest fires on a regional scale. While urbanand agricultural areas increased, although with different rates of growth, forests and semi-natural areasdecreased in the study area. These changes are reflected in a significant increase of vegetation sensitivityto forest fires measured by the forest fire risk (FR) index developed in the framework of <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>project.</b> The cover classes which contributed the most to the increase of the FR index were crop mosaic, mixedagricultural-natural areas and discontinuous, low-density settlements. Results of the present study indi-cate that the transformation of the fringe landscape towards low-quality agricultural and pasture areasand fragmented forest patches is potentially detrimental for environmental quality and the ecologicalfragility of land...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have dealt with the {{assessment}} of potential and actual desertification risk using composite indices. The Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESA) approach, developed in the framework of <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>project</b> funded by the European Community, {{is one of the most}} used procedures to monitor land vulnerability to degradation in the Mediterranean region. The final output of this procedure is an index (ESI) composing four indicators of climate, soil, vegetation, and land management based on 14 elementary variables. Although applied to a number of case studies throughout southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East, the performance of this monitoring system has never been assessed. The present study evaluates the robustness of the ESI through an original procedure incorporating sensitivity analysis and data cost analysis. For each variable, the standard error of the estimate, the correlation coefficient with the ESI, the sensitivity score, and the estimated costs of data collection and handling were calculated in order to evaluate the stability of the final index and the relative importance of each composing variable. The overall performance of the ESI was computed by averaging the score of the four indicators. Variables such as vegetation cover, climate aridity, rainfall, and the degree of land protection provided the largest contribution to the ESI. The illustrated approach is suited to evaluate the overall performance of a set of variables composing a synthetic index. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider explicitly the monetary costs of data collection and handling within a composite index evaluation procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} based on the {{observation}} that the processes of land degradation are the combined product of climatic and anthropic factors, and that in the northern Mediterranean context, human factors play the most relevant role. For this reason it is concerned with analysis and modeling of the key factors influencing the choice of alternative agricultural techniques adoptable at farm level, and hence their effects on soil degradation. To establish the risk of soil degradation under different environmental conditions, many research studies in the European Mediterranean context have found it useful to refer to the maps of ESAs(Environmentally Sensitive Areas). Using the results of the <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>project</b> for the Agri basin (Southern Italy), the study starts by grouping the area under investigation into five clusters of risk referring to the analysis of farm behaviours with respect to the land management. According to the socio-demographie data, in the analysis the family-farm is assumed to be the main decisional unit. In this context the family plays {{a central role in the}} allocation of all the resources available (natural and human) and, also in the implementation of the main environmental and agricultural policies. Moreover, using this of decisional unit it is possible to link the land use the chosen technology for a specific crop within the local economic system. The technology adopted for the main agricultural crop (wheat), covering the 52 % of the sown land of the area, has been comprehensively analysed under different environmental and managerial condition. The analysis of these relationship allows to identify both the key factors that, at farm level, are able to influence or encourage the effective implementation of “best practice” for any specific context, and the suitable techniques for mitigation of desertification processes. The conclusions are both focused on the adopted techniques and on the decisional processes to provide suggestions useful to decision makers...|$|E
40|$|A Fire Risk Index (FIRISK) {{based on}} an {{original}} land cover/land use nomenclature has been developed {{in the framework of}} EU-funded <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>projects</b> and integrated into a composite index of sensitivity to desertification (the so called environmentally sensitive area index: ESAI). The objective of the present study is to introduce a validation approach assessing the correlation between the FIRISK and seven independent fire indicators and quantifying the similarity in their spatial distribution in a study area (Attica, Greece) characterized by high fire risk and fragmented land-use structure. The FIRISK correlated positively with four out of seven fire indicators (average fire size, percentage of burnt area on the total municipal area, percentage of cropland and pastures burnt in each fire) in a non-linear fashion. Cluster analysis indicates that FIRISK spatial distribution was coherent with variables describing both fire size and the use of land endangered by fire. Results of the present study demonstrate that the FIRISK is a reliable indicator of fire risk within the ESAI framework. Moreover, the index is considered a key component of multi-criteria decision support systems classifying land according to the level of fire sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The ESAs (Environmentally {{sensitive}} areas) {{procedure was}} recently {{developed in the}} framework of <b>MEDALUS</b> European <b>project</b> to identify desertification-sensitive areas and used in many Mediterranean countries (Greece, Portugal, Italy, Egypt). The identification of areas sensitive to desertification by using the ESAs model was carried out in the Tusciano River basin (261 km 2) located in southern Italy (Campania region). All data characterizing the four groups of parameters related to soil quality, climate quality, vegetation quality and management quality were introduced in a geographical database, and superimposed using a GIS. A sensitivity analysis highlighted the impact of desertification on the river Tusciano catchment, highly diversified in terms of morphological, geological, climatic and land use features. The results of the ESAs model, showing {{that more than half of}} the area is sensitive to desertification, were compared with those related to soil loss, achieved by Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, based approximately on the same environmental factors. Nevertheless, ESAs procedure considers a wider range of parameters, allowing to characterize in greater detail the catchment in terms of climate, geomorphology, vegetation cover and socio-economic features. The drawn map therefore characterizes the sensitivity to erosion/desertification of the Tusciano catchment and can be regarded as a synthesis-sensitivity map, showing the areas with higher vulnerability on which mitigation measures should be focused...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{allocation}} {{of energy to}} mechanisms that generate and preserve architectural forms (i. e. developmental stability, complexity of branching patterns) and productivity (growth and reproduction) in response to environmental disturbances (i. e. grazing and resource availability). The statistical error in translational symmetry was used to detect random intra-individual variability during development. This {{can be thought of}} as a measure of developmental instability caused by stress. Additionally, we use changes in fractal complexity and shoot distribution of branch structures as an alternate indicator of stress. These methods were applied to Anthyllis cytisoides L., a semi-arid environment shrub, to ascertain the effect of grazing and slope exposure on developmental traits in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The results show that A. cytisoides maintains developmental stability at the expense of productivity. Anthyllis cytisoides was developmentally more stable when grazed and when on south-facing, as opposed to north-facing slopes. On the contrary, shoot length, leaf area, fractal dimension and reproductive-to-vegetative allocation ratio were larger in north- than in south-facing slopes. As a consequence, under extreme xeric conditions, shrub mortality increased in north-facing slopes, especially when not grazed. The removal of transpiring area and the reduction of plant competition favoured developmental stability and survival in grazed plants. Differences between grazed and ungrazed plants were most evident in more mesic (north-facing) areas. We are grateful to Terry Chapin for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions.

40|$|The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines {{desertification}} as “land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas {{resulting from}} various factors, including climatic variations and human activities”. Desertification {{is regarded as}} one of the major global environmental problems of the 21 st century and the African sub-Sahara is often quoted as the most seriously affected region with a significant loss of biological and economic productivity of the land. In this geographic area, desertification processes are usually generated by soil erosion due to climate characteristics and fluctuations, unsustainable land uses, overgrazing and inappropriate agricultural practices. Preventing desertification requires an improved understanding of its causes, impact, degree and association with climate, soil, water, land cover, socio-economic factors and their combined effects. The development of methodologies capable of managing large amounts of data in an integrated approach is needed because of the complexity and variety of forms of desertification processes. The study was carried out within the FP 7 -ENV- 2010 CLUVA project (CLimate change and Urban Vulnerability in Africa), aimed to estimate the sensitivity to land degradation in the urban and peri-urban areas of both Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Saint Louis (Senegal) cities. The approach was based on the implementation and adaptation of the modeling methodology developed within the <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>project</b> (MEditerranean Desertification and Land Use). The model is characterized by a multi-factor approach based on the assessment of both environmental quality indicators (climate, soil, vegetation) and anthropogenic factors (land management). The methodology is adaptable to the local conditions, considering that some key indicators can be operationally defined through the inclusion or exclusion of parameters and the scores assigned in order to match the specific relevance of the factors. All local data, arranged in a GIS environment, allowed the generation of maps identifying Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and Indices of Environmental Sensitivity (ESAI). As expected, the results highlighted an overall high sensitivity to desertification. In Ouagadougou, the poorly vegetated peri-urban zone, affected by an increasing demographic pressure as the result of immigration from surrounding rural areas, was found as the most vulnerable area; in Saint Louis, the critical zones were located mostly in the northern part of the study area, where both low quality of soil and overexploitation of vegetation, due to grazing and domestic use, increase the sensitivity to desertification. The described methodological approach has a potential to represent a valuable tool to orientate effective policies preventing and mitigating land degradation processes. Model validation and comparison with other widely applied methods to assess desertification are in progress...|$|E
40|$|Limited to fourth {{percent or}} less of the country’s total land area, Egypt’s {{agricultural}} landscape is threatened by the repercussions of climate change, desertification, soil depletion, and looming water scarcity. Outside of the Nile river valley and scattered fertile pockets in the desert oases, {{the vast majority of}} land is desert: rocky, parched and unable to support conventional farming. According to Egyptian National Action Program 2005 (ENAP), Egypt covers an area of about one million km 2 ~ 100 million hectares, out of which about of 76. 5 thousands km 2 ~ 7. 6 % of the total area are inhabited, and the remaining (92. 4 %) area is desert. Desertification is a very complex process governed by several variables which influence each other. It is thus not possible to conclude for the general picture from a single factor alone. This process has a high rate in arid and hyper-arid countries such as Egypt. The main objective of this research was to evaluation the present-day climate-induced desertification in El-Dakhla Oasis, so in this study, the newest method for evaluating and mapping of desertification was used. The mathematic method was carried out by European Commission (EC), (MEditerranean Desertification And Land Use) at the <b>MEDALUS</b> <b>project</b> and booked as ESAs in 1999 integrated with remote sensing and GIS. All indices of the model were revised before using, and regarding to the region condition these indices were defined as key indices which were: Temperature, precipitation, wind, albedo, ground water and soil benchmark, and each benchmark has some sub-layers getting from their geometric mean. Based on the MEDALUS model, each sub-benchmark was quantified according to its quality and given a weighting of between 1. 0 and 2. 0. All benchmarks should be reinvestigated and adjusted to local conditions. Ultimately, desertification severity was classified in four level including low, moderate, Severe and high Severe. ArcGIS 10 was used to analysis and prepares the layers of quality maps using the geometric mean to integrate the individual sub-indicator maps. In turn the geometric mean of six quality maps was used to generate a single desertification status map. Remote sensing data have great potential to improve models mapping spatial variability of temperature and precipitation since they are available as time worldwide, and have high spatial resolution. The HYDRA visualization software was used to measure the present surface albedo from MODIS product (MOD 43 C 1). Results showed that 60 % of the area is classified as Severe, 14 % as moderate and 12 %, 16 % as low and none affected by desertification respectively. In addition the climatic variations including rainfall, temperature, sunlight, wind indicators were the most important factors affecting desertification process in El-Dakhla Oasis...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{distinct}} approaches to assessing soil erosion risk. The first is by collecting data on actual erosion events {{to create a}} map of hot spots. This unambiguously identifies areas where erosion has occurred, but is limited on the episodic nature of extreme rainfalls and uneven reporting of events, {{so that it is}} difficult to compare severity on an objective basis. The alternative is to establish a model which forecasts the risk of erosion from an understanding of the physical processes. Working from climate statistics, it is possible to give an objective weighting to events of different magnitudes and estimate long term average rates, and how they vary over an area. However, it is much more difficult to calibrate such a model against data. The PESERA-RDI model attempts to model long term erosion from hillslopes at a pan-European scale. This is seen as a first step in identifying where erosion is a serious problem, and must be followed with more detailed modelling or monitoring within high-risk areas, both to obtain finer detail of the erosion risk and to understand the factors driving erosion at scales where mitigation strategies can be implemented. The underlying rationale is based on a one-dimensional hydrological model, which is used to estimate potential vegetation cover, if required and storm runoff based on climatic and vegetation data. The forecast runoff, accumulated across the frequency distribution of storms, is used to give a climatic erosion potential, which is then appropriately combined with measures of topography and soil erodibility to estimate the expected rate of soil erosion at a resolution of 250 m- 1 km. The methodology is based on EC research in the <b>MEDALUS</b> and MODEM <b>projects,</b> built on previous independent work (Kirkby and Neale 1987, de Ploey et a...|$|R
