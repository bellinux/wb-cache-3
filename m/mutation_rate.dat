5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability. This {{diversity}} {{is a result of}} its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high <b>mutation</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.|$|E

5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the <b>mutation</b> <b>rate.</b> Hence, it is being supported by selection.

Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} {{appearance}} of smallpox is not settled. It most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago. A second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago. A second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox at 3000–4000 years ago. This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding {{the appearance}} of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the <b>mutation</b> <b>rate</b> is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago. While this is consistent with the other published estimates, it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the <b>mutation</b> <b>rate</b> than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
40|$|Co-evolution of two coupled quasispecies is studied, {{motivated}} by the competition between viral evolution and adapting immune response. In this co-adaptive model, besides the classical error catastrophe for high virus <b>mutation</b> <b>rates,</b> a second ``adaptation-'' catastrophe occurs, when virus <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> {{are too small to}} escape immune attack. Maximizing both regimes of viral error catastrophes is a possible strategy for an optimal immune response, reducing the range of allowed viral <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> to a minimum.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that optimal per-locus <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> in GAs are {{proportional}} to selection pressure and the reciprocal of genotype length. In this paper we suggest that the notion of error threshold, borrowed from molecular evolution, sheds new light onthis argument. We show empirically the existence of error thresholds in GAs running on a simple abstract landscape � and then investigate a real-world industrial problem, demonstrating comparable phenomena in a practical application. We study the correspondence between error thresholds and optimal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> on these two problems, and explore the e ect of di erent selection pressures. Results suggest that error thresholds and optimal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> are indeed correlated. Moreover, as the selection pressure increases, both error thresholds and optimal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> increase. These ndings mayhaveprac tical consequences, as heuristics for measuring error thresholds in real-world applications will provide useful guidelines for setting optimal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model of}} DNA sequence evolution which can account for biases in <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> that depend on {{the identity of the}} neighboring bases. An analytic solution for this class of models is developed by adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for the CpG-methylation-deamination process which dominates point substitutions in vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using empirically obtained <b>mutation</b> <b>rates)</b> match the overall pattern observed in noncoding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and dinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent <b>mutation</b> <b>rates.</b> Also provided is the backward procedure to infer the <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> using maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> can be obtained very efficiently, using generic noncoding DNA sequences as input, after masking out long homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and versatile to use than the traditional method of deducing <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> by counting <b>mutation</b> events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of non-coding genomic DNA, and may be used as a null model for various sequence analysis applications.

40|$|The {{frequencies}} {{with which}} alleles are alike within (Q) and between (q) populations are formulated for monoecious populations undergoing drift and mutation with unequal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> among alleles for {{a finite number}} (k) of allelic states. The effective number of alleles and an application to Nei's measure of genetic distance [Nei, M. (1972) Am. Nat. 106, 283 - 292] are also considered for this model. The equilibrium values of Q and q increase as k decreases. Unequal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> further increase the equilibrium values and reduce the rates of approach of Q and q to these values. The transitional values of Q and q are very dependent on the initial population frequency composition when <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> are unequal. Reducing k, of course, reduces the effective number of alleles, which is further reduced by unequal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates.</b> Complications introduced by initial population composition, unequal <b>mutation</b> <b>rates,</b> and number of allelic states, coupled with data limitations for long-term measures of genetic distance or population differentiation, with mutation as the main driving force, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Epidermal and {{intestinal}} tissues divide {{throughout life}} to replace lost surface cells. These renewing tissues have long-lived basal stem cell lineages that divide many times, each division producing one stem cell and one transit cell. The transit cell divides {{a limited number}} of times, producing cells that move up from the basal layer and eventually slough off from the surface. If <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> are the same in stem and transit divisions, we show that minimal cancer risk is obtained by using the fewest possible stem divisions subject to the constraints imposed by the need to renew the tissue. In this case, stem cells are a necessary risk imposed by the constraints of tissue architecture. Cairns suggested that stem cells may have lower <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> than transit cells do. We develop a mathematical model to study the consequences of different stem and transit <b>mutation</b> <b>rates.</b> Our model shows that stem cell <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> two or three orders of magnitude less than transit <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> may favor relatively more stem divisions and fewer transit divisions, perhaps explaining how renewing tissues allocate cell divisions between long stem and short transit lineages...|$|R

40|$|Short tandem repeats (STRs) are mutation-prone loci {{that span}} nearly 1 % {{of the human}} genome. Previous studies have {{estimated}} the <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> of highly polymorphic STRs by using capillary electrophoresis and pedigree-based designs. Although this work has provided insights into the mutational dynamics of highly mutable STRs, the <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> of most others remain unknown. Here, we harnessed whole-genome sequencing data to estimate the <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> of Y chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) with 2 – 6  bp repeat units that are accessible to Illumina sequencing. We genotyped 4, 500 Y-STRs by {{using data from the}} 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. Next, we developed MUTEA, an algorithm that infers STR <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> from population-scale data by using a high-resolution SNP-based phylogeny.

Using our estimates, we identified determinants of STR <b>mutation</b> <b>rates</b> and built a model to predict rates for STRs across the genome.
