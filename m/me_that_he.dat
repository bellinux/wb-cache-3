25|$|But overweening vanity {{formed a}} strong part of Cruikshank's character. He boasted {{so much of}} the {{assistance}} he had rendered authors, that at last he believed he had written their works. Had he been connected with Fielding, he would no doubt have asserted that he wrote a great portion of Tom Jones. Moreover, he was excessively troublesome and obtrusive in his suggestions. Mr. Dickens declared to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not stand it, and should send him printed matter in future.|$|E
25|$|And though Mr. Edwards boast himselfe heare, to be a Minister of the Gospell, and a {{sufferer}} for it, yet I challenge him, {{to prove}} unto <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hath any Calling or, Ordination to the Ministry, but that which he hath successively from Rome; If he lay claime to that; {{he is one}} of the Popes household; But if he deny that calling, then is he as void of a calling to the worke of the Ministry, and as void of Ordination, as any of those Ministers, whom hee calleth Independant men, (which have cust off the Ordination of the Prelates) and consequently as void of Ordination as a macanicall trades man.|$|E

25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with {{the opinion of the}} man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E
25|$|The Director General {{has advised}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has found no {{evidence}} of any truth in the allegations. He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has advised me that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had {{no reason to believe that}} any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E
25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

The one <b>that</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> was the cousin of young bli--of the boy Albert, the page? I have been making inquiries, your lordship, and I regret to say I find that the man was a impostor. <b>He</b> informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> was Albert's cousin, but Albert now informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> 'as no cousin in America. I am extremely sorry this should have occurred, your lordship, and I 'ope you will attribute it to the bustle and haste inseparable from duties as mine on such a occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This man says,' {{observed}} Farnie, {{returning to}} Gethryn, 'that he'll drive {{me up to}} the College for seven bob. As it's a short four miles, and I've only got two boxes, it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> doing himself fairly well. What do you think?' ...|$|R
25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, {{they are}} {{becoming}} very tiresome. Someone who knows M. Eugène Figuière assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.|$|E
25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

Daddy didn't tell <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He's</b> {{not half}} so given to serious talk as you are, Whitewing, though I'm free to admit <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does take a fit o' that sort now an' again, and seems raither fond of it.

6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> going to put up {{buildings}} there at once?" [...] And Tappitt's face as he asked the question would have softened the heart of any ordinary lawyer. But Honyman was one whom nothing could harden and nothing soften.|$|R
6000|$|TANNER. He {{leaves me}} {{nothing but the}} charge of Ann's morals, {{on the ground that}} I have already more money than is good for <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had his wits about him, doesn't it? ...|$|R
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1951 season, O'Malley {{reportedly}} offered Robinson {{the job of}} {{manager of}} the Montreal Royals, effective {{at the end of}} Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the Montreal Standard as saying, [...] "Jackie told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post"—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.|$|E
500|$|By {{the first}} week of July, Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio {{recording}} his purpose-written song, [...] "Bangla Desh", with co-producer Phil Spector. The song's opening verse documents Shankar's plea to Harrison for assistance, and the lyrics [...] "My friend came to me with sadness in his eyes / Told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted help before his country dies" [...] provided an enduring image for what United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause.|$|E

[...] "I guess he'll wait, and kick when he's ready, but you tell him from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> up against quite a big thing." [...] He raised his voice: [...] "Well, I'll send that pork and flour along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blooming mystery," [...] {{the young}} man pronounced. [...] "That's the {{conclusion}} every one seems to arrive at. A chap I know, whose chauffeur pals up with Rees' valet, told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been having heaps of threatening letters from fellows who'd got the knock over the B. & I. He seemed to think they'd done him in." ...|$|R
500|$|Balzac worked {{these scenes}} from his boyhood—as he did {{many aspects of}} his life and the lives of those around him—into La Comédie Humaine. His time at Vendôme is {{reflected}} in Louis Lambert, his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : [...] "He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was {{recording}} [...] "We Are the World", Jackson {{approached him}} and admitted to lifting the bassline for [...] "Billie Jean" [...] from a Hall & Oates song (apparently referring to Hall's [...] "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" [...] from the 1981 album Private Eyes): [...] "Michael Jackson once said directly to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped I didn't {{mind that he}} copied that groove." [...] Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline, remarking, [...] "it's something we all do." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

[...] "You've taught him a lesson <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed, for {{it was always a}} word and a blow with him, and the word alone was worth five shillin' in a public court. He won't be so ready now to shake his nief in the face of {{everyone}} <b>he</b> meets. However, <b>that's</b> neither here nor there." ...|$|R

500|$|When J. Robert Oppenheimer {{began working}} on the nuclear weapon design for the Manhattan Project during World War II, Lawrence loaned Greene {{part-time}} to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself. [...] "When Robert returned from travel and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had just been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" [...] she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Foster Brown in the 1994 {{issue of}} Sister 2 Sister wrote that [...] "R. Kelly told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Aaliyah got {{together}} {{and it was just}} magic." [...] Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. [...] "I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and {{going in and out of}} his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said. [...] "you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them." ...|$|E

During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets.
