25|$|The disintegrin domain {{together}} with the TSP1 repeat, the following cysteine-rich and spacer domains are necessary for substrate recognition, binding and cleavage of the VWF-A2 domain. First, the spacer domain recognizes VWF, increasing the affinity of ADAMTS13 to VWF. Next the disintegrin-like domain engages in a low-affinity binding. Then the <b>metalloprotease</b> domain interacts with the VWF, similar to a three-step molecular zipper.|$|E
40|$|<b>Metalloproteases</b> (metallopeptidases) are {{composed}} of {{a diverse group of}} endopeptidases and exopeptidases. Because <b>metalloproteases</b> play key roles in many normal biological processes, their aberrant activities have been implicated in diseases such as arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, nephritis, disorders in the central nervous system, fibrosis, and infection, as well as others.

40|$|New {{magnetic}} nanoprobes {{based on}} surface-functionalized magnetite particles were synthesized {{and used to}} selectively capture <b>metalloproteases</b> from human saliva samples. In addition to their high specific surface area, these nanoparticles have metal ion chelating moieties grafted on their surface by the reaction with the organosilane EDTA-TMS ((N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl) -ethylenediaminetriacetate trisodium salt). The most distinct feature of these particles is their capability to selectively recover <b>metalloproteases</b> even in highly diluted saliva samples. The high affinity of these materials for <b>metalloproteases</b> was attributed {{to the formation of}} chelates between the chelating moieties and the metal ions of <b>metalloproteases.</b> These magnetic particles exhibited high colloidal stability in the biological standard buffers MES, HEPES, TEAB and Tris-HCl, within a significant pH range (pH 5 - 9) and, due to their magnetic features, enabled a fast separation of the <b>metalloproteases</b> from the medium by simply applying an external magnetic field. Thus, these materials were proven to be valuable probes for the selective enrichment and rapid recovery of <b>metalloproteases</b> from human saliva, particularly when dealing with trace amounts of material...|$|R

25|$|TNF is {{primarily}} produced as a 233-amino acid-long type II transmembrane protein arranged in stable homotrimers. From this membrane-integrated form the soluble homotrimeric cytokine (sTNF) is released via proteolytic cleavage by the <b>metalloprotease</b> TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE, also called ADAM17). The soluble 51 kDa trimeric sTNF tends to dissociate at concentrations below the nanomolar range, thereby losing its bioactivity. The secreted form of human TNFα {{takes on a}} triangular pyramid shape, and weighs around 17-kD. Both the secreted and the membrane bound forms are biologically active, although the specific functions of each is controversial. But, both forms do have overlapping and distinct biological activities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metallo{{protease}}s</b> are {{the most}} diverse of the four main protease types, with more than 50 families classified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is {{held in place by}} amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known <b>metalloproteases,</b> around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for <b>metalloproteases</b> as 'abXHEbbHbc', where 'a' is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1' subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, 'b' is an uncharged residue, and 'c' a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in <b>metalloproteases.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Neprilysin (...) , {{also known}} as {{membrane}} metallo-endopeptidase (MME), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10), and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MME gene. Neprilysin is a zinc-dependent <b>metalloprotease</b> that cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin. It also degrades the amyloid beta peptide whose abnormal misfolding and aggregation in neural tissue has been implicated {{as a cause of}} Alzheimer's disease. Synthesized as a membrane-bound protein, the neprilysin ectodomain is released into the extracellular domain after it has been transported from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the notch}} {{extracellular}} domain interacts with a ligand, an ADAM-family <b>metalloprotease</b> called ADAM10, cleaves the notch protein {{just outside the}} membrane. This releases the extracellular portion of notch (NECD), which continues {{to interact with the}} ligand. [...] The ligand plus the notch extracellular domain is then endocytosed by the ligand-expressing cell. [...] There may be signaling effects in the ligand-expressing cell after endocytosis; this part of notch signaling is a topic of active research. [...] After this first cleavage, an enzyme called γ-secretase (which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease) cleaves the remaining part of the notch protein just inside the inner leaflet of the cell membrane of the notch-expressing cell. This releases the intracellular domain of the notch protein (NICD), which then moves to the nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression by activating the transcription factor CSL. [...] It was originally thought that these CSL proteins suppressed Notch target transcription. However, further research showed that, when the intracellular domain binds to the complex, it switches from a repressor to an activator of transcription. Other proteins also participate in the intracellular portion of the notch signaling cascade.|$|E
2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. [...] Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted {{in the prevention of}} osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix <b>metalloprotease</b> (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance.|$|E

40|$|Extracellular zinc-containing <b>metalloproteases</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the bacterial world. The most extensively studied are those which are associated with pathogenic bacteria or bacteria which have industrial significance. They are found practically wherever they are sought in both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms, be they aerobic or anaerobic. This ubiquity in itself implies that these enzymes serve important functions for the organisms which produce them. Because {{of the importance of}} zinc to enzymatic activity, {{it is not surprising that}} there is a pervasive amino acid sequence homology in the primary structure of this family of enzymes regardless of their source. The evidence suggests that both convergent and divergent evolutionary forces are at work. Within the large family of bacterial zinc-containing metalloendopeptidases, smaller family units are observed, such as thermolysin-like, elastase-like, and Serratia protease-like <b>metalloproteases</b> from various bacterial species. While this review was in the process of construction, a new function for zinc-containing <b>metalloproteases</b> was discovered: the neurotoxins of Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum type B have been shown to be zinc <b>metalloproteases</b> with specificity for synaptobrevin, an integral membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles which is involved in neurotransmission. Additional understanding of the mode of action of proteases which contribute to pathogenicity could lead to the development of inhibitors, such as chelators, surrogate substrates, or antibodies, which could prevent or interrupt the disease process.
