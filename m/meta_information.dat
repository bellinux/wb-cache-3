40|$|Abstract — Usage {{of social}} media’s {{increased}} considerably in today world which enables {{the user to}} share their personal information like images with the other. This improved technology leads to privacy violation where the users are sharing the large volumes of images across more number of peoples. To provide security for the information, automated annotation of images are introduced which aims to create the <b>meta</b> data <b>information</b> about the images by using the novel approach called Semantic annotated Markovian Semantic Indexing(SMSI) for retrieving the images. The proposed system automatically annotates the images using hidden Markov model and features are extracted by using color histogram and Scale-invariant feature transform (or SIFT) descriptor method. After annotating these images, semantic retrieval of images {{can be done by}} using Natural Language processing tool namely Word Net for measuring semantic similarity of annotated images in the database. Experimental result provides better retrieval performance when compare with the existing system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{growing amount}} of data {{gathered}} nowadays, the need for efficient data mining methodologies is {{getting more and more}} common. There is a large number of different classification algorithms, but choosing the best one for given data is still a difficult task. Thanks to different data mining contests we can gather lots of <b>meta</b> level <b>information</b> about classification problems and strategies leading to optimal (or close to optimal) solutions. One of the contests was organized in parallel with the ICAISC’ 06 conference held in Zakopane. We took part in it, and our model classified the test data with the highest accuracy. The process which led to the winner model was not simple – it required multiaspect analysis of the data and different algorithms (from {{the point of view of}} suitability to the data). This article presents our road to the winner model with numerous comments on both successful and unsuccessful efforts. It also presents our model testing methodology, which always plays important role in the pursuit of accurate and well generalizing models. I...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{growth in}} sensor data and other {{temporal}} data increases {{the importance of}} retrieval and similarity search in time series data. Efficient time series query processing is crucial for interactive applications. Existing multidimensional indexes like the R-tree provide efficient querying for only relatively few dimensions. Time series are typically long which corresponds to extremely high dimensional data in multidimensional indexes. Due to massive overlap of index descriptors, multidimensional indexes degenerate for high dimensions and access the entire data by random I/O. Consequently, the efficiency benefits of indexing are lost. In this paper, we propose the TS-tree (time series tree), an index structure for efficient time series retrieval and similarity search. Exploiting inherent properties of time series quantization and dimensionality reduction, the TS-tree indexes high-dimensional data in an overlap-free manner. During query processing, powerful pruning via quantized separator and <b>meta</b> data <b>information</b> greatly reduces the number of pages which have to be accessed, resulting in substantial speed-up. In thorough experiments on synthetic and real world time series data we demonstrate that our TS-tree outperforms existing approaches like the R*-tree or the quantized A-tree. 1...|$|R
