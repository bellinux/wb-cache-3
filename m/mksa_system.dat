50|$|The main {{alternative}} to the Gaussian unit system is SI units, historically also called the <b>MKSA</b> <b>system</b> of units for metre-kilogram-second-ampere.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 {{this was}} adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the M.K.S. System of Giorgi without specifying which {{electromagnetic}} unit would be the fourth fundamental unit. In 1946 the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) approved a proposal to use the ampere as that unit in a four-dimensional system, the <b>MKSA</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) {{approved}} {{a new set}} of definitions for electrical units, based on the rationalized <b>MKSA</b> <b>system,</b> in 1946, and these were internationally adopted under the Metre Convention by the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1948. Under this system, which would become the International System of Units (SI), the ohm is a derived unit.|$|E
500|$|The CGS {{units of}} {{electricity}} were cumbersome to work with. This was remedied at the 1893 International Electrical Congress held in Chicago by defining the [...] "international" [...] ampere and ohm using definitions {{based on the}} metre, kilogram and second. In 1901, Giovanni Giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit, the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved. The metre-kilogram-second-coulomb (MKSC) and metre-kilogram-second-ampere (<b>MKSA)</b> <b>systems</b> are examples of such systems.|$|R
50|$|The ampere was {{originally}} defined as one {{tenth of the}} unit of electric current in the centimetre-gram-second system of units. That unit, {{now known as the}} abampere, was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart. The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the <b>MKSA</b> <b>system</b> would be conveniently sized.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrical}} unit for the base unit in a rationalized system depends only on practical considerations, particularly {{the ability to}} realize the unit accurately and reproducibly. The ampere rapidly gained support over the ohm, as many national standards laboratories were already realizing the ampere in absolute terms using ampere balances. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted the Giorgi system with the ampere replacing the ohm in 1935, and this choice of base units is often called the <b>MKSA</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
