40|$|A {{prototype}} <b>mucking</b> <b>machine</b> {{designed to}} operate in narrow-vein stopes was developed by Foster- Miller, Inc., Waltham, MA, under contract with the U. S. Bureau of Mines. The machine, called a compact loader-trammer, or minimucker, was designed to replace slusher muckers in narrow-vein underground mines. The minimucker is a six-wheel-drive, skid-steered, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine that loads muck at the front with a novel slide-bucket system and ejects it out the rear so that the machine {{does not have to}} be turned around. To correct deficiencies of the tether-remote-control system, a computer-based, radio-remote-control system was retrofitted to the minimucker. Initial tests indicated a need to assist the operator in guiding the machine in narrow stopes. An automatic guidance system that used ultrasonic ranging sensors and a wall-following algorithm was installed. Additional tests in a simulated test stope showed that these changes improved the operation of the minimucker. The design and functions of the minimucker and its computer-based, remote-control system are reviewed, and an ultrasonic-sensor-based guidance system is described...|$|E

The muck is removed {{regularly}} (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the <b>muck.</b> Many <b>machines</b> use [...] "spin disk filters", which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent.|$|R
40|$|VK: T 20703 The {{excavation}} {{and production}} in underground mines are complicated processes which consist {{of many different}} operations. The process of underground mining is considerably constrained by the geometry and geology of the mine. The various mining operations are normally performed in series at each working face. The delay of a single operation {{will lead to a}} domino effect, thus delay the starting time for the next process and the completion time of the entire process. This paper presents a new approach to the process control for underground mining operations, e. g. drilling, bolting, mucking. This approach can estimate the working time and its probability for each operation more efficiently and objectively by improving the existing PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method). If the delay of the critical operation (which is on a critical path) inevitably affects the productivity of mined ore, the approach can rapidly assign <b>mucking</b> <b>machines</b> new jobs to increase this amount at a maximum level by using a new mucking algorithm under external constraints.

40|$|The Exploratory Shaft (ES) at Yucca Mountain {{is planned}} to be {{constructed}} during 1985 and 1986 {{as part of the}} detailed site characterization for one of three sites which may be selected as candidates for location of a high-level radioactive waste repository. Conventional mining methods will be used for the shaft sinking phase of the ES project. The ES will be comprised of surface support facilities, a 1480 -ft-deep circular shaft lined with concrete to a finished inside diameter of 12 ft, lateral excavations and test installations extending up to 200 ft from the shaft, and long lateral borings extending up to 2300 ft from the shaft. The estimated time for sinking the shaft to a total depth of about 1480 ft and completing the lateral excavations and borings is about two years. The major underground development planned for the primary test level at a depth of 1200 ft consists of the equivalent of 1150 ft of 15 - by 15 -ft drift. The total volume of rock to be removed from the shaft proper and the lateral excavations totals about 1 / 2 million cubic feet. Construction equipment for the shaft and underground excavation phases consists of conventional mine hoisting equipment, shot hole and rock bolt drilling jumbos, <b>mucking</b> <b>machines,</b> and hauling machines. The desire to maintain relatively uniform and even walls in selected shaft and drift intervals will require that controlled blasting techniques be employed. Certain lateral boring operations associated with tests to be conducted in the underground development may pose some unusual problems or require specialized equipment. One of the operations is boring and lining a 30 -in. -diam by 600 -ft-long horizontal hole with a boring machine being developed under the direction of Sandia National Laboratories. Another special operation is coring long lateral holes (500 to 2000 ft) with minimum use of liquid circulating fluids. 8 figures...|$|R
