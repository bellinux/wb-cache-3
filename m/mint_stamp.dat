5000|$|... 8 plate 77s {{have been}} found so far, not 10 as {{mentioned}} in the July/August 2009 GB Journal. 4 <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> and 4 used. Two of the <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> have been lost leaving 6 currently accepted examples of plate 77 in existence although one is now disputed.|$|R
50|$|Stamp {{collectors}} employ loupes {{to improve}} their ability to evaluate {{the quality of their}} stamps. Identifying surface, adhesive, and perforation is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a <b>stamp.</b> <b>Mint</b> <b>stamps</b> (stamps without cancellations) with no wear can command a substantial premium over <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Practitioners of philately, the study of postage and revenue stamps, also employ loupes to identify counterfeit stamps that would pass naked-eye inspections.|$|R

5000|$|In about 1930 Switzerland {{began to}} use [...] "grilled gum", a light grill applied along the gum to {{counteract}} the tendency for gummed stamps to curl. The grill is most obvious on <b>mint</b> <b>stamps,</b> but is faintly visible on used stamps as well. This was abandoned around 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Penny Lilac stamps {{are often}} found as perfins - that is with {{initials}} or insignia added as perforations to <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> which meant {{they could not}} be redeemed for cash at a post office. The addition of perfins was widespread practice in Britain from the 1860s as a precaution against theft.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mint</b> <b>stamps</b> of Heligoland are {{moderate}} to medium priced {{but with some}} running to 1000 euros (2005) rarities. Some used stamps have brought 4800 euros at auction and some covers have brought 10 or 12 thousand euros. This is an inducement for forgery. Because used stamps are often more valuable than <b>mint</b> <b>stamps,</b> forged postal cancellations are plentiful and are the rule on purported high-value items. Because of the many forged cancellations and many reprints collectors of Heligoland stamps are advised either to become expert or to rely on specialists; most reputable dealers will not handle them because of the prevalence of reprints and forgeries. The collector who wishes to become expert is advised to acquaint himself with the Michel Deutschland Spezial Katalog and acquire, at least, Helmuth Lemberger's [...] "Helgoland Philatelie". Most of the philatelic literature is in German.|$|R
5000|$|In Germany it is {{symbol for}} a [...] "Gestempelte Briefmarke" [...] (canceled stamp), while a star means [...] "postfrisch" [...] (<b>mint</b> <b>Stamp)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike other collectibles, a <b>mint</b> <b>stamp</b> {{may be in}} poor {{condition}} {{but still}} be regarded as being in mint state {{as long as it}} is apparently unused.|$|E
50|$|In philately, a <b>mint</b> <b>stamp</b> is {{one which}} is in its {{original}} state of issue, is unused, has never been mounted and has full gum, if issued with gum. The term applies equally to postage stamps and revenue stamps.|$|E
5000|$|The Wellington Declaration {{was held}} to be so {{important}} that the Royal <b>Mint</b> <b>stamped</b> its slogans on the reverse of the 10/- silver coins RELIG:PROT:LEG:ANG:LIBER:PAR and silver half crowns (2/6) REL.PRO.LEG.ANG.LIB.PAR that it produced at that time. The inscriptions abbreviate the words [...] "RELIGIO PROTESTANTIUM, LEGES ANGLIAE, LIBERTAS PARLIAMENTI", which is the declaration in Latin.|$|R

5000|$|Great Britain and Ireland {{was a set}} {{of special}} {{commemorative}} postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail in 2006. The stamps were the final part of the British Journey series, which had previously featured Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. [...] It was available as <b>mint</b> <b>stamps,</b> as a presentation pack, stamps cards, and a first day cover.|$|R
50|$|Mint stamps {{are often}} more {{valuable}} than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive. A <b>mint</b> <b>stamp</b> may also be in better condition than a used stamp which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.|$|E
50|$|Technically CTOs are not fakes {{since they}} have been {{cancelled}} by the stamp issuing authority. Many of these are easily identified because while they have been postmarked they still retain their original gum. Some postal authorities cancel them and sell them at a considerable discount to the philatelic community. The authorities can do that profitably because they {{no longer need to}} provide the postal services that the stamps were meant to pay for. Many collectors are more interested in stamps that have been correctly used, and the corresponding used stamp may often be worth more than a <b>mint</b> <b>stamp.</b> Authorities who do this tend to use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time.|$|E

50|$|Apollonia, like Dyrrachium further north, was an {{important}} port on the Illyrian coast as the most convenient link between Brundusium and northern Greece, and {{as one of the}} western starting points of the Via Egnatia leading east to Thessaloniki and Byzantium in Thrace. It had its own <b>mint,</b> <b>stamping</b> coins showing a cow suckling her calf on the obverse and a double stellate pattern on the reverse, which have been found as far away as the basin of the Danube.|$|R
5000|$|A {{special stamp}} {{watermark}} detecting fluid may {{be applied to}} a stamp lying face down in a black plastic tray. As the fluid evaporates the watermark becomes visible and as it does not contain water the fluid may be used on <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> without damaging the gum. A drop of benzine {{can also be used}} to coax the watermark out of the paper but care should be observed as the inks of photogravure stamps are soluble in benzine and will ruin the stamp.|$|R
5000|$|The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (...) is a {{government}} ministry in North Korea {{which is responsible for}} the North Korean postal service, telephone system and media such as television and print press. Additionally, the ministry is responsible for <b>mint</b> <b>stamps.</b> The current minister is Sim Chol-ho, who was appointed to the post on February 2012. In 2010 the ministry participated in cyber-attack on South Korea using an IP address leased from China. Sim Chol-ho was reported executed in a February 2016 article.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{due to the}} centenary of International Women's Day, the National <b>Mint</b> and <b>Stamp</b> {{produced}} a commemorative silver coin valued at 20 euros. This coin shows the picture of Clara Campoamor.|$|R
5000|$|PNC3 - Plate Number Coil 3 - A {{strip of}} 3 <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> with the plate number coil {{on the center}} stamp. Although many {{collectors}} still collect coils in this format, {{a larger number of}} these collectors prefers the PNC5 format. As a result, a PNC3 is less desirable than a PNC5 as evidenced by many specialized stamp catalogs now assigning much higher premiums to PNC5 formats of earlier coil issues. Initially, saving PNC3s had been the practice adopted by many collectors and dealers alike and, therefore, not many early issues were saved in the longer format.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the Roman period, Gaza was {{a prosperous}} city and {{received}} grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Philistines, Greeks, Romans, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's <b>mint</b> <b>stamped</b> out coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 CE, Emperor Hadrian, who favored Gaza, personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium, which soon became known from Alexandria to Damascus. The city was adorned with many pagan temples—the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena {{and the local}} deity Tyche.|$|R
50|$|Starting with Elizabeth, {{the coins}} have {{the year of}} <b>minting</b> <b>stamped</b> on the reverse. Unusually, the sixpences minted in 1561 and 1562 were milled, i.e. {{produced}} by machine rather than by hand, with the press of the Frenchman Eloy Mestrelle, who had been granted authority to mint coins by the queen. Although of higher quality than hammered coins, Mestrelle's sixpences were more expensive to produce, and machine-struck coinage ceased to be minted in 1572. The coins remained in circulation for over a hundred years, but it took until the reign of Charles II for milled coins of the pound sterling to be minted again. Sixpences minted after the Tudor period no longer bear the Tudor rose on the obverse.|$|R
5000|$|Each letter {{receives}} a value between 5 and 1, where 5 {{is the best}} and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as [...] "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof {{of what they have}} heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel. While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for international reply coupons (IRCs), <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> from the verifying station's country or [...] "green stamps" [...] (US dollar bills).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{instances}} of stamps {{that have been}} produced in large quantities, but where comparatively very small numbers have done postage service. Huge quantities of <b>mint</b> <b>stamps</b> can be left over after a bout of inflation, a political overthrow or loss of a war. In some cases a genuine stamp can have a fake cancellation applied {{to make it appear}} to be a rare, and valuable postally used example. A notable example is the 90¢ U. S. stamp of 1860, withdrawn within a year, on which a genuine cancellation raises the Scott Catalogue value from US $3000 to $11,000. Scott's listing includes the caveat: [...] "All used examples … must be accompanied by certificates of authenticity issued by recognized expertizing committees." ...|$|R
