In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records; the label gave her £25,000 to produce an album, though they were unable to provide <b>much</b> <b>support</b> for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as Coldplay's X and virtual band Gorillaz' Demon Days.|$|E
5|$|Around 1262 or 1263, the Mamluk leader Baibars {{attempted}} {{an attack}} on Antioch, but the principality was saved by Mongol intervention. In later years the Mongols {{were not able to}} offer as <b>much</b> <b>support.</b> In 1264–1265 the Mongols were able to attack only the frontier fort of al-Bira. In 1268 Baibars completely overran the rest of Antioch, ending the 170-year-old principality.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from the West, where {{he was supposed to}} be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver his home state of Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E

5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to run for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too <b>much</b> <b>support</b> due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} strategy {{proposed by}} Gale {{results in a}} decisive victory in District 2, enabling the rebels to launch a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent to a relatively quiet sector so that a film crew can shoot propaganda. President Coin sends Peeta along, {{even though he is}} still dangerous and unpredictable. From this, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead because she has too much influence and has not shown <b>much</b> <b>support</b> for Coin.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without <b>much</b> <b>support</b> to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|I {{think we}} all know that we're going to hear {{announcements}} like this more often. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as <b>much</b> <b>support</b> since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1948 King's Birthday Honours, Kippenberger was {{appointed}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The same year, {{he was also}} elected Dominion President of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA), a position he would hold until 1955. While serving as RSA president, he courted controversy by his outspoken opposition to the All Blacks tour of South Africa in 1949, {{on the basis of}} the exclusion of Maori players from the team. While forced to apologise for his remarks, he received <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from Maori veterans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command <b>much</b> <b>support</b> at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how <b>much</b> <b>support</b> there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa <b>much</b> <b>support</b> in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's {{political}} {{reputation in}} the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him <b>much</b> <b>support</b> from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France.|$|E

Panama's economy is also very <b>much</b> <b>supported</b> by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.|$|R
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>support</b> {{has been}} {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win behind one of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain <b>much</b> <b>support,</b> Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E
