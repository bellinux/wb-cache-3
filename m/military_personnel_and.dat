5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>and</b> equipment.

5|$|Despite the {{tensions}} of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help {{within a few}} days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had {{a large part of the}} international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>and</b> a transport plane from Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents.

5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>and</b> on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>and</b> bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
