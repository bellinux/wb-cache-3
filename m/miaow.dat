500|$|Media organisations {{including}} the BBC and The Guardian incorrectly reported mephedrone was commonly {{used as a}} plant fertiliser. In fact sellers of the drug described it as [...] "plant food" [...] because it was illegal to sell the compound for human consumption. In late 2009 UK newspapers began referring to the drug as meow or <b>miaow</b> (sometimes doubled as meow meow or <b>miaow</b> <b>miaow),</b> a name that was almost unknown on {{the street at the}} time. In November 2009, the tabloid newspaper, The Sun published a story stating that a man had ripped off his own scrotum whilst using mephedrone. The story was later shown to be an online joke posted on mephedrone.com, later included in a police report with the caveat that it could be unreliable. The police report was used as a source for the story in The Sun. Other myths the media often repeated during 2010 were that mephedrone had led to the deaths of over 20 people, teachers were unable to confiscate the drug from pupils and the government was too slow to ban the drug. Parallels were drawn between the media coverage of mephedrone and a piece of satire by Chris Morris in 1997 on Brass Eye when he tricked public figures into talking of the dangers of taking the fictional legal drug [...] "cake". The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) have suggested that the media coverage of the drug led to its increased usage. Jon Silverman, a former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent, has written two articles discussing how the media had a strong influence over the UK government's drugs policy, particularly in that the government wished to demonstrate they were being [...] "tough" [...] on drugs.|$|E

When I pass like the night wind over the roofs of the houses men shudder in their beds and tremble. When they hear my voice as I creep stealthily along their {{balconies}} they cry to their gods for succor. They arise, and from their windows they offer me their priceless household treasures--the sacred vessels dedicated to their great god Shiv--which they call 'Shivin Mugs'--the Kloes Brosh, the Boo-jak, urging me to fly them! And yet," [...] said <b>Miaow</b> mournfully, [...] "it is but my love-song! Think ye {{what they would do}} if I were on the war-path." ...|$|E

50|$|François-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif (1687, Paris - 19 November 1770, Paris) was a French {{writer and}} poet, {{of a family}} {{originally}} of Scots origin. He was appointed historiographer royal to Louis XV of France. His parody of owlishly pedantic scholarship, Histoire des chats, {{and the protection of}} the house of Orléans gained him entry to the Académie française. Maurepas records in his memoirs that at the induction ceremony, a member let loose a cat he had secreted in his pocket: the cat <b>miaowed,</b> the Académiciens <b>miaowed</b> and the serious oration dissolved in laughter.|$|R

60|$|The {{animals were}} silent. They {{did not like}} <b>Miaow's</b> slang, and were jealous of her {{occasionally}} sitting on a Man Cub's lap. Once Dunkee, a poor relation of the Gee Gees, had tried it on, disastrously--but that is also Another and a more Aged Story.|$|R
60|$|It was true. The watering-place was empty. Moo Kow, <b>Miaow,</b> and the Gee Gees had disappeared. Presently {{there was}} a booming crash and a long, deep {{rumbling}} among the distant hills. Then {{they knew they were}} near the old Moulmein Pagoda, and the dawn had come up like thunder out of China 'cross the bay. It always came up that way there. The strain was too great, and day was actually breaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then came}} a curious experience. I heard a <b>miaow</b> behind me, and turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover outside the window. A thought came into my head. 'Everything ready for you,' I said, {{and went to the}} window, opened it, and called softly. She came in, purring--the poor beast was starving--and I gave her some milk. All my food was in a {{cupboard}} {{in the corner of the}} room. After that she went smelling round the room, evidently with the idea of making herself at home. The invisible rag upset her a bit; you should have seen her spit at it! But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed. And I gave her butter to get her to wash." ...|$|E

I stopped the gas engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed. I {{found it hard to}} sleep. I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began <b>miaowing</b> about the room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I remember the shock I had when striking a light--there were just the round eyes shining green--and nothing round them. I would have given it milk, but I hadn't any. It wouldn't be quiet, it just sat down and <b>miaowed</b> at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the window, but it wouldn't be caught, it vanished. Then it began <b>miaowing</b> {{in different parts of the}} room. At last I opened the window and made a bustle. I suppose it went out at last. I never saw any more of it.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the game}} {{migrated}} north through Europe in the 18th century {{the number of}} cards {{and the name of}} the game changed.

500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1800s, the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain.

5000|$|December in {{the late}} 1950s in a Lancashire village. Out of the {{darkness}} and howling wind a voice sings [...] "Behold! For {{the day of the}} Lord will come." [...] (PROLOGUE) Someone strikes a match - it is Eddie, a labourer on the Bostock farm, who is carrying a sack from which kittens' <b>miaows</b> can be heard. He drops the sack into a canal. Cathy, Nan and Charles, Mr. Bostock's children, watch him from a hiding place and, as Eddie exits, they rescue the kittens. Caring for them will be difficult; they can not show them to Dad, as he will give them back to Eddie (THE KITTENS). Charles tries unsuccessfully to give one to his friend, Jackie Greenwood, and to a Salvation Army woman. However, as nobody wants them, they eventually decide to keep all three in a barn on the farm.|$|R

I whipped out some chloroform, applied it, and answered the door. 'Did I hear a cat?' she asked. 'My cat?' 'Not here,' said I, very politely. She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room; strange enough to her no doubt--bare walls, uncurtained windows, truckle-bed, with the gas engine vibrating, and the seethe of the radiant points, and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and went away again." ...|$|R
