40|$|Undifferentiated, highly chlorophyllous cell cultures; {{undifferentiated}} white cell cultures; green, shoot-forming cultures; and white, shoot-forming {{cultures of}} Digitalis purpurea L. were established and subcultured every 3 weeks in liquid {{media in the}} light or in the dark. The digitoxin content, the chlorophyll content, and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity of these cultures were assayed. The light-grown, green, shoot-forming cultures accumulated considerable amounts of digitoxin (about 20 to 40 micrograms per gram dry weight), and the white, shoot-forming cultures without chloroplasts accumulated about one-third that amount of digitoxin. The chlorophyll content and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity of the undifferentiated green cells were {{about the same as}} they were in the green, shoot-forming cultures, but the digitoxin content of the former was extremely low (about 0. 05 to 0. 2 microgram per gram dry weight), which is about the same as that in undifferentiated white cells without chloroplasts. Thus, it was concluded that the chloroplasts are not essential for the synthesis of digitoxin in Digitalis cells. The optimum concentrations of the tested compounds for accumulation of digitoxin were: benzyladenine, 0. 01 to 1 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> liter; indoleacetic acid, 0. 1 to 1 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> liter; α-naphthaleneacetic acid; 0. 1 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> liter; and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0. 01 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> liter...|$|R

40|$|Dried marine algae, {{which are}} eaten {{together}} with rice and vegetables, may contain {{very high levels}} of iodine. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has evaluated the health risk from dried marine algae after finding 506 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram in one product. Consumption of a 10 gram helping already leads to excessive iodine intake that is 10 {{times higher than the}} upper tolerable iodine intake of 0. 5 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> day deemed to be safe in Germany. Consequently, this can lead, in some cases, to serious health damage. BfR, therefore, believes that dried algae products with an iodine content of 20 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram and higher should not be placed on the market as they can harm health. The iodine levels in dried algae and kelp products are particularly high. They vary between 5 and 11, 000 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram dry weight whereby the contents of individual types of algae fluctuate considerably. In order to protect consumers from marine algae products with high iodine levels, BfR recommends laying down uniform maximum levels in the European Union. Furthermore, the manufacturers and suppliers of algae products should provide mandatory information about the amount of algae used, their preparation, the iodine content and the maximum recommended daily portion which must be oriented towards the recommended daily iodine intake. This is the only way for consumers to be able to determine the amount of iodine actually ingested from a product of this kind...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model of blood cholinesterase inhibition in rats {{resulting from a}} single oral or dermal dose of parathion was developed and tested. The model consists {{of a set of}} non-linear differential equations describing the absorption, distribution and metabolism of parathion and the kinetics of inhibition and reactivation of erythrocyte and plasma cholinesterase. The equations are numerically integrated to produce the time-course of each of the cholinesterase activities of the blood. The model was tested for validity by a comparison of the activities predicted by the model to values determined experimentally in male rats. The model successfully simulated plasma cholinesterase activity after a four <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram oral dose, and total blood cholinesterase activity after a one <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram oral dose. Erythrocyte cholinesterase activity was closely predicted for the first three hours after a four <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram oral dose, but inhibition was overestimated during the next two hours. Agreement between model output and observed erythrocyte cholinesterase activity was good for the first twenty four hours after initiation of a fifteen <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> kilogram dermal dose, but the rate of activity regeneration was overestimated. Es-timated erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibition is sensitive to changes in the values of parameters controlling liver paraoxon metabolism and the phosphorylation reaction between paraoxon and the enzyme, but in general, the model is not sensitive to small perturbations of parameter values. The model has potential for interpreting human exposures to parathion and for investigating the relationships between various parameters and blood cholinesterase inhibition...|$|R

Phase 1 of leaf development (first 11 days, leaf to one-third area) showed increasing net import of C and N, with phloem contributing 61 % of the imported C and 18 % of the N. 14 C feeding studies suggested the potential for simultaneous import and export through phloem over the period 9 to 12 days.

Eighty-two% of xylem-delivered N was consumed in leaf growth, the remainder exported in phloem. Phase 3 (20 - 38 days) showed high but declining rates of photosynthesis, translocation, and net export of N. Phase 4 (38 - 66 days) exhibited substantial losses of N and declining photosynthesis and translocation of C. C:N ratio of xylem sap remained constant (2. 3 - 2. 6) during leaf life; petiole phloem sap C:N ratio varied from 25 to 135 over leaf development. The relationships between net photosynthesis and N import in xylem were: phase 1, 4. 8 <b>milligrams</b> C <b>per</b> <b>milligram</b> N; phase 2, 24. 7 <b>milligrams</b> C <b>per</b> <b>milligram</b> N; phase 3, 91. 9 <b>milligrams</b> C <b>per</b> <b>milligram</b> N; and phase 4, 47. 7 <b>milligrams</b> C <b>per</b> <b>milligram</b> N...|$|R
