50|$|Benzodiazepine drugs {{including}} <b>medazepam</b> {{increase the}} inhibitory {{processes in the}} cerebral cortex by allosteric modulation of the GABA receptor.

It has major active benzodiazepine metabolites, which gives it a more prolonged therapeutic effects after administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor {{are similar to}} those of neurosteroids. Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing GABA function and in turn have effects on mood and other functions. Many benzodiazepines (diazepam, <b>medazepam,</b> estazolam, temazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam) potently inhibit the enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurosteroids. The tetrahydroxazole ring that cloxazolam and oxazolam have decreases the inhibitory potency of benzodiazepines on neurosteroids. Thus there could be subtle differences between cloxazolam and other benzodiazepines. However, because the parent prodrugs of cloxazolam and oxazolam were tested rather than the active metabolites, this is purely speculative.|$|E

40|$|In the feline {{cerebral}} cortex flurazepam and ethanol potenitated the inhibitory effects of iontophoretically-applied GABA and electrically-evoked inhibition (believed to be mediated by GABA). This effect is specific, since both flurazepam and ethanol antagonized the inhibitory effects of serotonin, dopamine and glycine. Moreover {{the degree of}} potentiation of GABA-mediated electrically-evoked cortical inhibition produced by five benzodiazepines (Ro 21 - 3981, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, <b>medazepam</b> and clozapine) : (a) correlated with their relative affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor when all five drugs were applied with equal iontophoretic doses; (b) was {{not significantly different from}} one drug to another, when the benzodiazepines were applied in doses inversely proportional to their relative affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor. Iontophoretically-applied flurazepam consistently potentiated the conductance increase produced by iontophoretically-applied GABA in CA 1 and CA 3 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus. Furthermore, both iontophoretically-applied flurazepam and intravenously injected ethanol consistently prolonged the time course of the GABA-mediated IPSP conductance increase evoked in CA 1 and CA 3 pyramidal hippocampal neurons by ipsilateral entorhinal or fimbrial stimulation. These effects were independent of membrane potential changes. It is concluded that GABAergic neurotransmission has a special role in the neurophysiology of anxiety.

To assess the potential use of PXR as a sensor for aquatic emerging pollutants, we employed an in vitro reporter gene assay (HG 5 LN-hPXR cells) to screen a panel of environmental chemicals and to assess PXR-active chemicals in (waste) water samples. Of the 57 compounds tested, 37 were active in the bioassay and 10 were identified as new PXR agonists: triazin pesticides (promethryn, terbuthryn, terbutylazine), pharmaceuticals (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, clonazepam, <b>medazepam)</b> and non co-planar polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs; PCB 101, 138, 180). Furthermore, we detected potent PXR activity in two types of water samples: passive polar organic compounds integrative sampler (POCIS) extracts from a river moderately impacted by agricultural and urban inputs and three effluents from sewage treatment works (STW). Fractionation of POCIS samples showed the highest PXR activity in the less polar fraction, while in the effluents, PXR activity was mainly associated with the dissolved water phase. Chemical analyses quantified several PXR-active substances (i. e., alkylphenols, hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, PCBs, bisphenol A) in POCIS fractions and effluent extracts. However, mass-balance calculations showed that the analyzed compounds explained only 0. 03 % and 1. 4 % of biological activity measured in POCIS and STW samples, respectively. In effluents, bisphenol A and 4 -tert-octylphenol were identified as main contributors of instrumentally derived PXR activities. Finally, the PXR bioassay provided complementary information as compared to estrogenic, androgenic, and dioxin-like activity measured in these samples. This study shows the usefulness of HG 5 LN-hPXR cells to detect PXR-active compounds in water samples, and further investigation {{will be necessary to}} identify the detected active compounds...|$|E
40|$|To summarise, it can {{be stated}} that many psychotropic {{substances}} or drugs {{were used in the}} field of dentistry in East Germany (GDR). During the 1950 s the most commonly used psychotropic drugs used in dentistry in the GDR were herbal medizines, bromides, and bromid-urea derivatives, methyl pentinol Pentinol®), aconitine, caffeine, codeine, reserpine, numerous barbituric acid derivatives Lepinal® and Kalypnon®, the guaiacol glycerine ether Neuroton®, the benactyzine product Procalm®, the hydantoin derivatives Phenytoin AWD and Lepitoin® and in particular, the phenothiazine derivatives Propaphenin® (chlorpromazine) and Prothazin® (promethazine). The centrally acting analgesics Dolcontral® (pethidine) and Morphinum hydrochloricum AWD were used on in-patients, rarely on out-patients. The primary fields of indication in which psychotropic substances were administered were premedication, anxiolysis, postmedication, pain therapy, trigeminal neuralgia therapy, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents, as well as some forms of craniomandibular dysfunction. In the 1950 s premedication and anxiolysis did not yet enjoy the status they do today. In the 1960 s the first minor tranquilizers manufactured in the GDR – Meprobamat (1961) as well as the benzodiazepine derivatives Timosin® (chlordiazepoxide 1967), Faustan® (diazepam 1968) and Radedorm® (nitrazepam 1969) – came onto the pharmaceuticals market and were successfully applied for their respective purposes in nearly all fields of indication in dentistry. The minor tranquilizer Radepur® (previously Timosin®) and, in particular, Faustan® proved to be the treatment of choice in the spheres of premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents. In the early 1970 s the minor tranquilizer Rudotel® (<b>medazepam</b> 1973) and the antiepileptic agent Finlepsin® (carbamazepine 1974) came onto the pharmaceuticals market in the GDR. The non-cardioselective beta-blocker Obsidan® (propranolol 1969) and the cardioselective beta-blocker Cordanum® (talinolol 1976) displayed excellent effectiveness, especially in the premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of certain cardiovascular diseases, but they did not succeed in becoming permanently established in the sphere of anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry. In the 1980 s there were not outstanding developments and changes as regards the application of psychotropic substances in dentistry. The broadest range of applications was that of the group of minor tranquilizers from the benzodiazepine class of drugs. All neuropsychotropic drugs in the GDR were available only on prescription. The centrally acting analgesics such as Dolcontral® and Morphinum hydrocloricum AWD were subject to the Narcotics Act.

40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, <b>medazepam,</b> midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
