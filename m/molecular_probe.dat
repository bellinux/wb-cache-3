The repeating single bond-double bond structure of α-parinaric acid distinguishes it structurally and chemically {{from the usual}} [...] "methylene-interrupted" [...] arrangement of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have double-bonds and single bonds separated by a methylene unit (−CH2−). Because of the fluorescent properties conferred by the alternating double bonds, α-parinaric acid is commonly used as a <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> {{in the study of}} biomembranes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> is a {{group of}} atoms or {{molecules}} used in molecular biology or chemistry to study the properties of other molecules or structures. If some measurable property of the <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> used changes when it interacts with the analyte (such as a change in absorbance), the interactions between the probe and the analyte can be studied. This makes it possible to indirectly study the properties of compounds and structures which may be hard to study directly. The choice of <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> will depend on which compound or structure is being studied as well as on what property is of interest. Radioactive DNA or RNA sequences are used in molecular genetics to detect the presence of a complementary sequence by molecular hybridization.|$|E

50|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>Probes</b> {{was founded}} by Drs. Richard and Rosaria Haugland while Richard Haugland was an {{assistant}} professor of chemistry at Hamline University. The intention of <b>Molecular</b> <b>Probes</b> was to make available for research purposes fluorescent dyes that would be of utility for biomedical research applications and that were not available from other sources. The company relocated from Roseville, Minnesota to Plano, Texas in July 1978 where it was incorporated. <b>Molecular</b> <b>Probes</b> remained in Plano until it moved to a remote site in the woods outside Junction City, Oregon in July 1982. <b>Molecular</b> <b>Probes</b> relocated into the city of Eugene, Oregon in 1988 where it remains today.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{chemical}} biology, a chemical probe is a small molecule {{that is used to}} study and manipulate a biological system such as a cell or an organism by reversibility binding to and altering the function of a biological target (most commonly a protein) within that system.

50|$|Digoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found {{exclusively}} in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata.

50|$|Strengths: The {{strength}} of micro-PET {{is that because}} the radiation source is within the animal, it has practically unlimited depth of imaging. The acquisition time is also reasonably fast, usually around minutes. Since different tissues have different rates of uptake radiolabelled <b>molecular</b> <b>probes,</b> micro-PET is also extremely sensitive to molecular details, and thus only nanograms of <b>molecular</b> <b>probes</b> are needed for imaging.|$|R
5000|$|... 8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS), {{also called}} 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, is an organic {{compound}} containing both a sulfonic acid and an amine group. This compound {{is used as}} a fluorescent <b>molecular</b> <b>probe.</b> For example, ANS can be used to study conformational changes induced by ligand binding in proteins, as ANS's fluorescent properties will change as it binds to hydrophobic regions on the protein surface. Comparison of the fluorescence in the presence and absence of a particular ligand can thus give information about how the binding of the ligand changes the surface of the protein. Its permeability to mitochondrial membranes makes it particularly useful.|$|E

50|$|N2H+ is {{most often}} {{observed}} in dense molecular clouds, where it has proven useful {{as one of the}} last molecules to freeze out onto dust grains as the density of the cloud increases toward the center.

This showed that even N2H+ is not an ideal tracer for the chemistry of dense pre-stellar cores, and concluded that H2D+ may be the only good <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> of the innermost regions of pre-stellar cores.|$|E

40|$|Hydroxyl (OH) radical is {{the most}} {{important}} reactive species produced by the plasma-liquid interactions, and the OH in the liquid phase (dissolved OH radical, OHdis) takes effect in many plasma-based applications due to its high reactivity. Therefore, the quantification of the OHdis in the plasma-liquid system is of great importance, and a <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> method usually used for the OHdis detection might be applied. Herein we investigate the validity of using the <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> method to estimate the [OHdis] in the plasma-liquid system. Dimethyl sulfoxide is used as the <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> to estimate the [OHdis] in an air plasma-liquid system, and the partial OHdis is related to the formed formaldehyde (HCHO) which is the OHdis-induced derivative. The analysis indicates that the true concentration of the OHdis should be estimated from the sum of three terms: the formed HCHO, the existing OH scavengers, and the OHdis generated H 2 O 2. The results show that the measured [HCHO] needs to be corrected since the HCHO destruction is not negligible in the plasma-liquid system. We conclude from the results and the analysis that the <b>molecular</b> <b>probe</b> method generally underestimates the [OHdis] in the plasma-liquid system. If one wants to obtain the true concentration of the OHdis in the plasma-liquid system, one needs to know the destruction behavior of the OHdis-induced derivatives, the information of the OH scavengers (such as hydrated electron, atomic hydrogen besides the <b>molecular</b> <b>probe),</b> and also the knowledge of the OHdis generated H 2 O 2.

40|$|Liver {{fibrosis}} is {{a symbolic}} process of many chronic liver diseases, and liver biopsy is {{the gold standard}} for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in clinical practice. At present, {{there is a lack of}} effective methods for the noninvasive diagnosis of early-stage liver fibrosis. The process of liver fibrosis is accompanied by complicated changes at the molecular level, which are associated with the progression of liver fibrosis.
