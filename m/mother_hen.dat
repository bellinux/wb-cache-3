5|$|Courteney Cox portrays Monica Geller, the <b>mother</b> <b>hen</b> of {{the group}} and a chef, known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and {{obsessive-compulsive}} nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others for having been extremely overweight as a child, especially by her brother Ross. Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica’s first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time, until Richard expresses that {{he does not want to}} have children, much to Monica’s dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series.|$|E

50|$|When {{witnessing}} chicks in distress, domesticated hens, Gallus {{gallus domesticus}} show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol {{found that in}} conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the <b>mother</b> <b>hens</b> heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened {{whether or not the}} chick felt as if they were in danger. <b>Mother</b> <b>hens</b> experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.|$|R

500|$|On her arrival, Susan was {{described}} as being [...] "staid" [...] and more open-minded than her husband, Karl. Woodburne told the Soap Show that Susan is a [...] "good mum" [...] who means well. Her children are her number one priority and she overcompensate's for her husband's disciplinarian style. This {{has led to a}} Holy Soap writer describing Susan as [...] "the <b>mother</b> <b>hen</b> of the street". Network Ten say that Susan is the [...] "heart and soul of Erinsborough", with a good sense of humour and the skills of a ninja. Susan has been through a [...] "rough ride". She has had to cope with Karl's infidelity, a divorce, her second husband dying hours after their wedding, being betrayed by her nephew and revealing that she killed her mother. TV Week said [...] "But, through it all, Susan has often provided a home for people in trouble, including a number of the Timmins kids and the kids of her dead husband." [...] This has made her one of the most [...] "enigmatic and appealing characters" [...] within the show.|$|E
500|$|Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like {{other young}} women in Playboy pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, {{oblivious}} to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie [...] "glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism" [...] with a [...] "good-natured lack of desire". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's <b>mother</b> <b>hen</b> roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout {{the remainder of the}} series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a straight-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their <b>mother</b> <b>hen,</b> and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes that Monica serves as [...] "the solid center in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E
40|$|National audiencePrevious {{experiments}} {{of maternal}} deprivation {{have demonstrated that}} an absence of maternal care impacts the behavioural development of young animals. Here we assessed whether {{the presence of a}} <b>mothering</b> <b>hen</b> influences the spatial exploration of Japanese quail chicks, after the period of mothering. Brooded and non-brooded chicks were placed in a novel environment containing feeding troughs. The distribution of chicks and their inter-individual distances were measured during repeated tests. Brooded chicks exhibited a higher ability to disperse, progressively exploiting a larger surface, and accessing food more easily. We observed a delay in the exploration of non-brooded chicks, suggesting a deficit in their exploratory motivation and/or spatial skills. We discuss that brooded chicks experienced the constraint to follow the <b>mothering</b> <b>hen,</b> and to adapt to frequent reconfigurations of their environment.

5000|$|Chickens are gregarious {{birds and}} live {{together}} in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a [...] "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in <b>mother</b> <b>hens</b> to call their chicks {{and encourage them to}} eat.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the immune response to infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccination in maternally immuned chicks. The effect of vaccination on meat quality of broilers was also studied. IBD intermediate vaccines were given to maternally immune chicks at different ages so as to identify {{the best time for}} the vaccines to break through maternally derived antibodies (MDA). The antibody titres were determined after two weeks of vaccination using agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) and were found as follows: In chicks vaccinated at one week of age is 1 : 2 in 43 % of chicks and 1 : 4 in 34 % of them. In chicks vaccinated at two weeks of age is 1 : 2 in 43 % of chicks and 1 : 4 in 50 % of them, while in chicks vaccinated at three weeks of age: 1 : 2 in 31 % and 1 : 4 in 38 % and 1 : 8 in 31 % of them. The results obtained also showed that vaccination of chicks at three weeks of age is recommended as very low of maternal antibodies were detected. Great variation (spread) of titres in just hatched chicks was also observed. This variation within off spring from one parent flock is attributed to titre variation between inividual <b>mother</b> <b>hens.</b> Booster dose with 228 E give a slight increase in Ab response in chicks primary vaccinated with intermediate strain. In another experiment, it is concluded that vaccination of chicks using hot vaccine obviously affected the meat quality. Haemorrhages in 11 thigh and pectoral muscles and bursal lesion, were observed. There fore, hot vaccine should only be administered in severly affected areas, but not under normal conditions. The results obtained also revealed that better Ab responses to the vaccine virus were observed in chicks reared in open pens compared to those reared in closed pens...|$|R
