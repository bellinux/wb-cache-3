[...] In 1940, the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King introduced conscription under the National Resources Mobilization Act, but with the caveat that conscripts could only be used in the defence of North America, and only volunteers would be spent overseas. Mackenzie King scheduled a referendum for 27 April 1942 to ask the voters to release him from his promise to only send volunteers overseas, which Montgomery alluded to in her letter mentioning [...] "conscription will come in".

Younger brother CEO: I can't replace him, because he's my older brother, and I have to think my way out of it, or we may have a confrontation.

40|$|Notes from Home is an {{installation}} of five hand-made photobooks presented on domestic-style shelves. It represents a new turn in my exploration of autobiographical storytelling. Using material {{shot in the}} early 2000 s – mostly unseen until this work – the project focuses in minute detail on the tiny stories present in everyday life within a domestic interior. In a development from my earlier projects on cockroaches and cupboards, Notes from Home concentrates more on banal events dramatised through vivid colour and close-up photography. The five series are: Gifts from the Cats (dead animals of various sorts); Making Cakes (eccentric cakes made with my youngest son); The Rise and Fall of Father Christmas (the making of a papier-mâché life size FC by <b>my</b> <b>older</b> <b>son</b> {{over a period of}} months and then its demise); Pete's Food and Flowers (obsessive dinners made and flowers picked by the lodger) and Super Snacks (me eating personally constructed snacks).

However, the final project only emerged with the subsequent production of the concertina books. These introduce a narrative structure that brings together a vast number of previously unseen images, combining them with short texts {{at the end of each}} sequence. Notes from Home was first realized in its current form as {{an installation}}/book project in 2008 for the exhibition Cockroach Diary and Other Stories, and was re-exhibited in the Deutsche Börse Prize 2010.

Perhaps some voters will think that they will be borne by the companies themselves, leaving all living persons miraculously unharmed. Slightly savvier citizens might think that company taxes are entirely borne by investors. A central tenet of public finance, however, is that the entity that has the legal obligation to pay a tax is not necessarily the one that bears the burden.
