The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and <b>micro-encapsulation.</b> For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E
25|$|A typical nuclear {{medicine}} study involves administration of a radionuclide {{into the body}} by intravenous injection in liquid or aggregate form, ingestion while combined with food, inhalation as a gas or aerosol, or rarely, injection of a radionuclide that has undergone <b>micro-encapsulation.</b> Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide (leukocyte scintigraphy and red blood cell scintigraphy).

25|$|Self-assembled vesicles are {{essential}} components of primitive cells. The second law of thermodynamics {{requires that the}} Universe move in a direction in which entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. Researchers Irene A. Chen and Jack W. Szostak amongst others, suggest that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to essential cellular behaviours, including primitive forms of differential reproduction competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells. Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage {{for the evolution of}} cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. Such <b>micro-encapsulation</b> would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it.

The process involves creating biocompatible micro-membranes which are implanted using in-vitro fertilization technology. Until recently, the implantation posed a number of productivity problems, as it was taking 15 minutes for one micro-membrane to be implanted. Altran teams stepped in to help solve this problem. Their studies demonstrated that the automated implantation option, using a laser optical guidance system, was the most promising approach. With the cooperation of Tarbes E.N.I. students, Altran consultants developed a robot to automate the microcapsule filling operation using a dual-needle system. The robot is now commercialized.|$|E

This, the phase changing material, which utilizes heat storage properties of the substances, capsulizes substances that melt at a constant temperature. This is applied to construction materials to block or save energy due to heat storage and heat protection during the process in which substances melt or freeze according to the indoor or outdoor temperature. The <b>micro-encapsulation</b> method is used to create thermal storage from phase changing material. This method can be broadly classified in 3 ways: chemical method, physical and chemical method and physical and mechanical method. In the physical and chemical method, a wet process using the <b>micro-encapsulation</b> process utilized.

The approaches investigated included <b>micro-encapsulation</b> with palladium and mixed-metal mantles using electroless plating.

The improvement in the kinetics of hydrogen charging was credited to a synergistic effect between the palladium and nickel atoms in the catalytic mantle and the formation of an ‘interfacial bridge’ for hydrogen diffusion by the nickel atoms in the deposited layer.
