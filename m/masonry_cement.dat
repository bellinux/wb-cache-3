40|$|Cement treated {{materials}} {{are widely used}} as road bases in pavements. Shrinkage of these materials due to moisture and temperature changes is a critical issue for determining shrinkage cracking in pavements. This paper presents the influence of four mixture variables (<b>masonry</b> content, <b>cement</b> content, water content and degree of compaction) on drying shrinkage and {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) of cement treated demolition waste with recycled masonry and concrete (CTMiGr). The experimental results showed that the masonry content was the dominating factor affecting dry shrinkage and CTE of CTMiGr. Increasing the masonry content can not only lead to an obvious decrease of dry shrinkage of CTMiGr, but also a low CTE level. Dry shrinkage of CTMiGr increased as the increase of cement content as well as degree of compaction and water content. The CTE of CTMiGr was between 7. 58 × 10 - 6 /°C and 10. 22 × 10 - 6 /°C, which was mainly determined by the <b>masonry</b> and <b>cement</b> content.

5000|$|Portland clinker is {{the main}} {{constituent}} of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add {{a certain amount of}} water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. [...] "Blended cements" [...] and <b>Masonry</b> <b>cements</b> may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. [...] They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.|$|R

5000|$|Lime mortar is more porous than cement mortars, and it wicks any {{dampness}} in {{the wall}} to the surface where it evaporates. Thus any salt content in the water crystallises on the lime, damaging the lime and thus saving the <b>masonry.</b> <b>Cement</b> {{on the other hand}} evaporates water less than soft brick, so damp issues are liable to cause salt formation and spalling on brick surfaces and consequent disintegration of bricks. This damp evaporation ability is widely referred to as 'breathability'.|$|E

5000|$|Kiln Four {{was built}} in 1954, {{increasing}} the plant output to around 300,000 tonnes by the late 1950s. Further growth continued into the 1960s as the mass slum clearances lead to mass redevelopment in towns and cities. By the late 1960s, the plant had grown by an extra two kilns and production stood at over 600,000 tonnes. Development by the Ketton lab saw a rapid-hardening cement (branded [...] "Kettocrete") and a waterproof cement product being made, thanks to the further understanding of what differing proportions and quantities of minerals in the clinker could achieve. Water repellent and <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> were also developed by the laboratory, with differing quantities often controlled manually with little control by technology.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of ASTM standard C 91, <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> mortars have become widely used for masonry construction in low to moderate seismic regions. However, the Masonry Standards Joint Committee Code prohibits the use of <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> mortars in lateral force resisting systems for structures that fall into Seismic Design Categories D, E, and F. The general objective {{of this study is}} to examine the appropriateness of this restriction in light of past research and, if necessary, propose additional research required to fill any existing knowledge gap. Since information about the specific impact of the physical and mechanical properties of <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> mortars on the seismic response of masonry shear walls is limited, this paper primarily focuses on research that has identified the influence of mortar on the behaviour of masonry assemblages. In particular, this paper summarizes the available literature on in-plane pier response as well as the response of masonry assemblages under axial compression, flexural tension, bed joint shear and diagonal tension. The primary gap identified through this literature review was the lack of experimental research that addressed the response of reinforced masonry shear walls constructed with <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> mortar. To establish a comprehensive and efficient research program to fill this gap, the available literature related to the behaviour of partially grouted reinforced masonry shear walls was also reviewed and key factors that influence response were established.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been the {{development}} of a <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> according to DIN 4211 including a high content of lignite fly ash (BFA). These demands are nearly fulfilled by a mixture of an average ''Rheinisch'' BFA with cement clinker, blast furnace slag and different admixtures. The investigated fly ash is originated from a power plant, fired with mixed lignite. Verifying the recipe, using a selection of ashes and clinkers with different compositions provided positive results. The prerequisite for this target is the careful arrangement of components. With a suitable selection of ingredients and correct dosage of admixtures it is possible to produce a <b>masonry</b> <b>cement</b> with up to 40 percent BFA. As a result of the ashes' self hardening properties we are able {{to reduce the amount of}} cement clinker. Due to ecological and economical reasons this seems useful. So like other well tried secondary sources, e. g. fly ash from hard coal or blast furnace slag, the BFA is suitable for utilisation in building materials, too.
