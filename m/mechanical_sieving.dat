40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of white cell (WBC) reduction in 16 -hour-old CPDA- 1 red cell (RBC) concentrates by filtration on a column filter and on three different flatbed filters were studied by electron microscopy, with {{special emphasis on}} cell-to-cell interaction, cell damage, and interaction of blood cells with the material. Generally, lymphocytes were removed by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> and monocytes by adherence and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving.</b> Granulocyte depletion occurred by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving,</b> direct adhesion to the fibers, and indirect adhesion to activated and spread platelets. In the column filter, most granulocytes were captured by adhesion. In the coarse layers {{of two of the}} flatbed filters, indirect adhesion was most prominent, whereas direct adhesion was most prominent in the other flatbed filter. For the most part, granulocytes were captured by direct adhesion in the fine layers, but in one flatbed filter, capture apparently occurred by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that the efficiency and the mechanism of WBC reduction depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the non-woven materials in the filters as well as the cellular composition of the RBC concentrates...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt at}} {{applying}} the {{digital image processing}} (DIP) technique to analyze the particle size distribution of coarse aggregate is made. Three different types of aggregates have been analyzed, and thei r gradi ng curves are compared to those obtained by conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving.</b> Because DIP produces only area gradation and uses a particle size definition different from the square sieve size used in <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving,</b> direct comparison is not possible unless the gradation basis and particle size definitions of the two methods are aligned. For this purpose, a simple method of converting the area gradation to mass gradation is proposed. Moreover, a size correction factor is used to convert the particle sizes measured by DIP to equivalent square sieve sizes so that comparison between the DIP and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> results can be made. The study demonstrates that DIP is a fast, convenient, versatile, and accurate technique for particle size distribution analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{considered}} as a save pesticide application method, treated seeds can pose environmental risks when abraded pesticide-laden seed particles are expelled during sowing. This dust drift risk is clearly linked with the seed coating quality. Seed coating quality is traditionally assessed with Heubach dustmeters and guidelines are established in terms of ‘Heubach value’. This technique may, however, not take all drift sensitive particles in to account. In this study, results of the Heubach test are compared to two alternative setups: <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> and individual sowing element. RESULTS: The abrasion potential assessed with the Heubach dustmeter was {{much lower than the}} total dust fraction generated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> and the individual sowing element. The amount of dust produced and its particle size distribution of the both other techniques were comparable. CONCLUSION: It looks like the Heubach dust meter underestimates the risk of dust drift. Using one of the alternative methods might be a more appropriate way to assess the abrasion potential of seeds. Due to the low investment cost required, <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> seems a good approach for non-specialized labs. The individual sowing element setup is the most realistic simulation of the in-field dust drift generation but requires a higher initial investment. Therefore, this setup is most suitable for specialized labs and is recommended for further research in this area. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|In many {{eutrophic}} lakes, {{ability to}} cope with filamentous cyanobacteria is crucial to Daphnia fitness, as the filaments can reduce food intake by interference with food-particle retention. Two basic mechanisms were proposed to explain food collection by Daphnia: <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving,</b> in which filtering appendages act as sieves, and direct interception, in which appendages act as paddles and water does not pass through. As was recently suggested, both mechanisms may be active, and their relative importance is determined by the Reynolds number on filtering appendages. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> seems particularly sensitive to the interference from filamentous cyanobacteria, which can clog the meshes while passing through the filtering chamber. We therefore hypothesized that in the presence of filaments, Daphnia minimizes the interference with filtration by decreasing the Reynolds number on the filters and by thus reducing the relative importance of sieving. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses of nine clones of the Daphnia longispina group to the presence of nontoxic, filamentous cyanobacteria. The presence of cyanobacteria triggered in Daphnia responses of both behavioral (descending to deep, cold waters) and morphological nature (decreased intersetal and intersetular distances in the filtering apparatus).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 229 - 239). Multi-view shape-from-silhouette {{systems are}} increasingly used for analysing stones. This thesis presents methods to estimate stone shape and to recognise individual stones from their silhouettes. Calibration of two image capture setups is investigated. First, a setup {{consisting of two}} mirrors and a camera is introduced. Pose and camera internal parameters are inferred from silhouettes alone. Second. the conﬁguration and calibration of a high throughput multi-camera setup is covered. Multiple silhouette sets of a stone are merged into a single set by inferring relative poses between sets. This is achieved by adjusting pose parameters to maximise geometrical consistency speciﬁed by the epipolar tangency constraint. Shape properties (such as volume, flatness, and eiongation) are inferred more accurately from the merged silhouette sets than from the original silhouette sets. Merging is used to recognise individual stones from pairs of silhouette sets captured on different occasions. Merged sets with sufﬁcient geometrical consistency are classiﬁed as matches (produced by the same stone), whereas inconsistent sets are classiﬁed as mismatches. Batch matching is determining the one-to-one correspondence between two unordered batches of silhouette sets of the same batch of stones. A probabilistic framework is used to combine recognition by merging (which is slow, but accurate) with the efﬁciency of computing shape distribution-based dissimilarity values.

For each of the matrices, the flow resistance, yield shear stress, plastic viscosity, and the mini-slump spread were measured and compared to one another. The flow resistance was found through flow progress in the FlowCyl-apparatus. The yield shear stress and the plastic viscosity were found through measurements done in the rheometer machine, while the mini-slump spread was found through the mini-slump spread measurement. In order to investigate the relation between the flow properties with the specific surface area (SSA), each of the filler's SSA had to be calculated. This was done through retrieving the particle size distribution (PSD) from a combination of <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving</b> and a SediGraph analysis. A PSD is the particle grading curve of a filler, indicating the mass percentage of each particle size. The SediGraph works best when the maximum particle size of the analyzed sample is 63 micron. The particles above 63 micron were taken care of by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sieving.</b> The SSA is calculated by summarizing the surface area per particle, within each particle size, and multiplying that with the mass percentage of each particle size. Through the results, some of the admixture dosages, for both w/c's, were revealed to be insufficient to reduce the matrix's yield shear stress to a negligible level. The matrices with the sufficient dosages indicate the relationships expected between the different flow properties. This means that the conclusion is based on the filler's effect on the flow properties with both sufficient and insufficient admixture dosages. What the results show is that when using a sufficient admixture dosage, the yield shear stress reduces to a point where it does not disturb the results. This implies that the matrix's flow resistance is closely related to the plastic viscosity. And the filler's effect on the flow resistance can be determined unambiguous and predictable with respect to SSA, given that a sufficient admixture dosage is used to reduce the yield shear stress to a negligible level...|$|E

The results of measurement of each particle size fraction are summed up proportionally to its weight with the use of Elsieve software system and for every type of material particle-size distribution can be obtained. The software allows further statistical interpretation of the results. Beam of infrared radiation identifies size of particles and counts them precisely. Every particle is represented by an electronic impulse proportional to its size. Measurement of particles in aqueous suspension that replaces the hydrometer method can be carried out by using the IPS L analyser (range from 0. 2 to 600 μm). The IPS UA analyser (range from 0. 5 to 2000 μm) is designed for measurement in the air. An ultrasonic adapter enables performing measurements of moist and aggregated particles from 0. 5 to 1000 μm. The construction and software system allow to determine second dimension of the particle, its shape coefficient and specific surface area. The AWK 3 D analyser (range from 0. 2 to 31. 5 mm) is devoted to measurement of various powdery materials with subsequent determination of particle shape. The AWK B analyser (range from 1 to 130 mm) measures materials of thick granulation and shape of the grains. The presented method of measurement repeatedly accelerates and facilitates study of granulometric composition...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} of landfilling thermally treated and untreated coal tar-contaminated soil is expensive, {{and it is}} a waste of a potentially useful material and landfill space. A less expensive and possibly more practical alternative is to use coal tar-contaminated soil as an aggregate in concrete. Because little work has been done in this area, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of coal tar-contamination and thermal treatment on the physical properties of soil and the strength of concrete containing contaminated soil as an aggregate. Also assessed was the leachability of coal tar constituents (specifically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) from contaminated soil, concrete containing contaminated soil, and concrete containing thermally-treated contaminated soil. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>sieve</b> analyses and direct shear tests showed no significant change in grain size distribution or internal friction angle for contaminated and uncontaminated soil treated at 250 and 550 Compressive and splitting tensile strength tests performed on concrete specimens showed a slight decrease in strength with the degree of incorporation of contaminated aggregate. Concrete compressive strength, elastic modulus, and tensile strength also decreased as the aggregate treatment temperature increased, especially at temperatures in excess of 450 However, the strength decreases were small (less than 15 %), and the concrete strength was still within typical values for structural concrete. The leachability tests showed that as treatment temperature was increased, levels of PAHs in the soil significantly decreased. From the leachability tests performed on samples of crushed concrete that contained contaminated soil, it appears that only low molecular weight PAHs (i. e., less than or equal tol 66 g/mol) were stabilized by the concrete. The poor stabilization of higher molecular weight PAHs may be an artifact of the sample preparation method which required that the concrete be crushed prior to leaching...|$|R
