A total of 1, 338 PubMed searches were run using the term “urinary bladder cancer” and a risk factor term (e. g., “cigarette smoking”) and were screened to identify 260 articles for final analysis. The search strategy had an overall precision of 3. 42 percent, relative recall of 12. 64 percent, and an F -measure of 5. 39 percent. Although search terms derived from MeSH had the highest overall precision and recall, the differences did not reach significance, which indicates that for generalized, free-text searches of the PubMed database, the searchers' own terms are generally as effective as MeSH terms...|$|E

Objective: To clarify the possible mechanisms of xylitol actions to inhibit the growth of otopathogenic bacteria and to describe researches that contribute for the discussion about the feasibility of the use of this sugar in the prevention of AOM. Method: Literature review based on scientific articles selected by means of the medical databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed (<b>MeSH)</b> and <b>Web</b> of Science. Results: Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of xylitol to prevent the AOM, when it is administered five times a day in chewing gum. However, this sugar is not so effective in the prevention of AOM during upper airways infections. Final Comments: Xylitol seems to be an effective strategy in prevention of acute otitis media.

40|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM) has been widely used for the {{structural}} modeling of physical systems. Due to computation-intensiveness and computation-locality, it is attractive to implement the {{finite element method}} on distributed memory multicomputers. Many research efforts have already provided solid algorithms for mesh partitioning and load balancing. However, without proper support, mesh partitioning and load balancing are labor intensive and tedious. In this paper, we present an unstructured mesh partitioner and load balancer (UMPAL) on World Wide Web (WWW). UMPAL is an integrated tool that consists of five components, a partitioner, a load balancer, a simulator, a visualization tool, and a Web interface. In the partitioner, three partitioning methods, Jostle/DDM, Metis/DDM, and Party/DDM are provided. The load balancer provides two load-balancing methods, prefix code matching parallel load-balancing and binomial tree based parallel load-balancing. The simulator provides a performance simulation environment for a partitioned mesh. By inputting parameters of a target distributed memory multicomputer, one can get the execution result of a partitioned mesh from the simulator. The visualization tool provides a way for users to view a partitioned <b>mesh.</b> The <b>Web</b> interface provides a mean for users to use UMPAL via the Internet and integrates the other four parts.

Improving either function increases prey capture and they are largely determined by different aspects of web architecture.

Probability of prey capture increased with web size but was not affected by mesh width. Conversely, spiders on narrow-meshed webs were almost {{three times more likely to}} capture energetically profitable large insects, which demand greater prey retention. Yet, the two functions are still constrained during web spinning because increasing <b>mesh</b> width maximizes <b>web</b> size and hence interception, while retention is improved by decreasing mesh width because more silk adheres to insects.
