5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>population</b> in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E

40|$|The silver/gold-lipped pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima (Jameson 1901), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pearl producing species throughout Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The commercial production of high value "South Sea" pearls is based on the culture of P. maxima, and stands to benefit substantially from the implementation of long-term selective breeding programs. Industry-wide interest towards genetic improvement of P. maxima is rapidly growing, however, several fundamental issues must be addressed before selection commences. To achieve sustained response to selective breeding, it is essential that adequate genetic diversity is present within the population; yet currently there is little known about how the culture process affects diversity in P. maxima. This thesis addresses key issues concerning the capture and maintenance of genetic diversity in cultured P. <b>maxima</b> <b>populations,</b> as well as identifying and understanding patterns of genetic structure and diversity distribution throughout its natural range. As the source of broodstock to create base populations for selective breeding, it is important to understand the genetic properties of wild P. <b>maxima</b> <b>populations.</b> Analysis of microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in wild P. <b>maxima</b> <b>populations</b> throughout its natural distribution revealed a gradient in genetic diversity across its range, with decreasing levels of variation seen in peripheral populations when compared to those situated more centrally (i. e. central Indonesia). Significant genetic structuring and differentiation was also observed amongst populations, and is attributed to historic and contemporary biogeographic influences. Comparisons between wild and cultured P. <b>maxima</b> <b>populations</b> indicate a high level of genetic erosion has occurred in hatchery-propagated populations, with effective populations sizes (Nₑ) as low as 3. 5 and reductions in microsatellite variation as high as 44...|$|R

However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures.|$|E

The 1860 Wiyot Massacre took place on Indian Island in the spring of 1860, committed by a group of locals, thought to be primarily Eureka businessmen.

40|$|Intraspecific genetic {{diversity}} governs {{the potential of}} species to prevail {{in the face of}} environmental or ecological challenges; therefore, its protection is critical. The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) is a significant reservoir of the world's marine biodiversity and a region of high conservation priority. Yet, despite indications that the IAA may harbour greater intraspecific variation, multiple-locus {{genetic diversity}} data are limited. We investigated microsatellite DNA variation in Pinctada <b>maxima</b> <b>populations</b> from the IAA to elucidate potential factors influencing levels of genetic diversity in the region. Results indicate that genetic diversity decreases as the geographical distance away from central Indonesia increases, and that populations located towards the centre of P. maxima's range are more genetically diverse than those located peripherally (P < 0. 01). Significant partitioning of genetic variation was identified (FST = 0. 027; RST = 0. 023, P < 0. 001) and indicates that historical biogeographical episodes or oceanographic factors have shaped present population genetic structure. We propose that the genetic diversity peak in P. <b>maxima</b> <b>populations</b> may be due to (i) an abundance of suitable habitat within the IAA, meaning larger, more temporally stable populations can be maintained and are less likely to encounter genetic bottlenecks; and/or (ii) the close proximity of biogeographical barriers around central Indonesia results in increased genetic diversity in the region because of admixture of genetically divergent populations. We encourage further genetic diversity studies of IAA marine biota to confirm whether this region has a significant role in maintaining intraspecific diversity, which will greatly assist the planning and efficacy of future conservation efforts...|$|R
