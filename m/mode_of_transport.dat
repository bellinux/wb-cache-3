5|$|There are daily express trains {{connecting}} {{major cities}} in Tamil Nadu like Chennai, Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore. There are weekly express trains connecting Coimbatore, Varanasi and Bhubaneswar. Passenger trains ply from Rameswaram to Madurai and Trichy daily, making railways {{as the major}} mode of transportation. The Ramanathapuram â€“ Rameswaram National Highway is the main connecting link from Rameswaram to the mainland. Prior to the 1914 train service linking the mainland with Rameswaram, boats were the only <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> to Rameswaram island.|$|E
5|$|As over 86% of Uttarakhand's terrain {{consists}} of hills, railway services are very limited {{in the state}} and are largely confined to the plains. In 2011, the total length of railway tracks was about 345km. Rail, being the cheapest <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> is most popular. The most important railway station in Kumaun Division of Uttarakhand is at Kathgodam, 35 kilometres away from Nainital. Kathgodam is the last terminus of the broad gauge line of North East Railways that connects Nainital with Delhi, Dehradun, and Howrah. Other notable railway stations are at Pantnagar, Lalkuan and Haldwani.|$|E
5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E
50|$|Auto-rickshaws {{and other}} <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> are {{available}} {{in and around the}} town.

A Proposed SivasAgar-Majuli bridge on river Bramahputra and an Express highway would connect Sivasgar with the World's largest river island, Majuli soon.|$|R
40|$|Serie : WIT Transactions on The Built Environment, ISSN 1743 - 3509, vol. 116 The {{application}} of sustainability principles on {{the definition of}} policies and actions for urban mobility relies on the promotion of less pollutant, economic, and more equitable <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> such as walking and cycling, also known as smooth <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> In this paper, a methodology is presented and described under the concept of healthy route generation. This integrates the contamination <b>of</b> the smooth <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> network, according to the noise levels and air pollution indices of the urban environment {{in which it is}} located, with the main objective of reducing the exposure level and the risk of development of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only {{slightly lower than}} the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to {{the limited number of}} workplaces within walking distance.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab blood was added by stallions who were {{turned out in}} the Welsh hills. Other breeds have also been added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire Coach Horse. Before the car was developed, the quickest <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by trotting them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could complete this feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such trotting tests.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the city}} council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains {{to be the main}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This will allow 9,000people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. The first T1000 was {{scrapped}} on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars, no. 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). In 2008, the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated. In 2010, Ruten decided that they would not put back into service, largely because of high maintenance costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series. The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010, after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} trains {{have successfully}} out-competed planes: by August 2008, {{half of the}} air routes between Taipei and the country's western cities had been discontinued, including all connections between cities with THSR stations except for a single daily connection between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Total domestic air traffic {{was expected to be}} halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually fell from 8.6 to 4.9million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for conventional rail between Taipei and Kaohsiung fell from 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most common <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{state has}} {{excellent}} civil aviation infrastructure with Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow and Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport in Varanasi, providing international service. and four domestic airports located at Agra, Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Kanpur. The Lucknow Airport is the second-busiest airport in North India after the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. The state has also proposed creating the Taj International Airport at Kurikupa near Hirangaon, Tundla in Firozabad district. An international Airport is also proposed at Kushinagar. The Lucknow Metro is being {{constructed in the}} city of Lucknow as an alternative <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> The capital city is witnessing a swift {{rise in the number of}} immigrants and this has called for the transformation of Public modes of transport.|$|E
50|$|Although ITS may {{refer to}} all <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> the {{directive}} <b>of</b> the European Union 2010/40/EU, {{made on the}} 7 July, 2010, defined ITS as systems in which {{information and communication technologies}} are applied in the field <b>of</b> road <b>transport,</b> including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|R

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, an {{addition}} 15 units were ordered by Oslo, with {{an option for}} further orders later. This will allow all the eastern lines to have a 7.5-minute headway on their services into the city center, instead of the current 15-minute headway. Trains would start using the balloon loop located at Stortinget, and the western lines {{will continue to have}} a 15-minute headway. At the same time, the trains serving the Ring Line will be extended to six cars. The order cost NOK675 million. In addition, Akershus finalized their order for five units, costing NOK240 million. Unlike the Oslo-owned units, Akershus' five units will be owned by the transit authority Ruter. The same year, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkoll Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains to be the main <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> to Holmenkollen during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011.

In 2009, the T2000 units were taken out of service, and on 22 April 2010 the last T1300 was taken out of service, making the MX3000 the only units to be used on the Oslo Metro. The city council was considering ordering 15 additional MX3000 to replace the T2000, as an alternative for a NOK50-million renovation.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Cuba, Castro {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{protests against the}} governmentâ€™s attempts to raise bus fares, a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> used mostly by students and workers. That year, Castro married Mirta DÃ­az Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirtaâ€™s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to spend in a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirtaâ€™s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido AutÃ©nticos new candidate, Carlos PrÃ­o SocarrÃ¡s. PrÃ­o faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, PrÃ­o agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control.|$|E
