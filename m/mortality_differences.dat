50|$|Cognitive {{epidemiology}} is a {{field of}} research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores (IQ scores or extracted g-factors) and health, more specifically morbidity (mental and physical) and mortality. Typically, test scores are obtained {{at an early age}}, and compared to later morbidity and mortality. In addition to exploring and establishing these associations, cognitive epidemiology seeks to understand causal relationships between intelligence and health outcomes. Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and <b>mortality</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E

In men, the main part of the <b>mortality</b> <b>difference</b> results from factors responsible for excess mortality of the Finnish-speaking population from cardiovascular diseases and non-natural causes of death.

50|$|In 2012, {{an article}} by Bøhn et al., in Environmental Sciences Europe, {{disagreed}} with the viewpoint of Ricroch et al. that the German ban was “scientifically unjustified”.

Furthermore, only selected data from the literature (those showing negative effects) were qualitatively scrutinized - studies showing no effect were simply quantitatively described without their quality being subjected to the same level of critique. The effect of such a double standard in the evaluation of the quality of biosafety science means that those only reading or referring to Ricroch et al. will be seriously misinformed about both the available biosafety science and the German ban on MON810 maize. However, Bøhn et al. do not claim that the ban was finally and irreversibly justified by the science referred to, as this was ultimately seen to be a political decision.|$|E
40|$|In many {{empirical}} studies <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> between socioeconomic groups (SES) {{decrease in the}} higher age groups. However, the mechanism behind this convergence is unknown. This study presents empirical evidence and possible explanations. Danish register data of all men in Denmark above age 58 between 1980 and 2002 (n= 938. 427) and event history analysis is used to study <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> between income groups, controlled for eight other variables.

The upper 75 percent of the income distribution have very similar mortality levels, but have approximately only 35 percent of the mortality risk of the poorest 10 percent. Mortality differentials are stable across age groups (controlled for health) but they converge completely when health is deteriorating. This study shows that instead of “age as leveler” it is “illness as leveler”. The finding that SES only has a very small impact on the transition from poor health to death shows that SES <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> do not exist because ill people with low SES have poor access to intensive or expensive medical care. It rather suggests that SES differences in mortality originate in the period of prevention and early treatment.

This topic is increasingly discussed in the political debate and {{is among the most}} urgent public health issues. However, it is still unknown if socioeconomic <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> increase or decrease with age. This book provides a comprehensive, thoughtful and critical discussion of all aspects involved in the relationship between socioeconomic status, health and mortality. In a well-written language, it synthesizes the sociological theory of social inequality and an empirical study of <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> that has been performed at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Rostock, Germany). The best available datasets from Denmark and the USA, as two very different countries, are used to analyze the age pattern of social <b>mortality</b> <b>differences,</b> the Danish register data covering the whole Danish population between 1980 and 2002. This study is the most comprehensive analysis of socioeconomic <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> in the literature, in terms of data quantity, quality, and the statistical method of event-history modeling.

40|$|Abstract-Although {{regional}} differences in lung cancer mortality {{are likely to}} be attributable to {{regional differences}} in tobacco smoking, studies in various countries found only weak relationships. This paper aimed at explaining regional differences in lung cancer mortality in the Netherlands. In a first step, clues for the role of smoking were obtained from a detailed description of regional <b>mortality</b> <b>differences.</b> These differences were found to be strongly determined by cohort effects: they vary between birth cohorts, and have been stable for over 30 years. Regional <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> reflect a diffusion of the lung cancer epidemic from high-income regions to low-income regions.

40|$|Objectives Mortality in {{patients}} starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{is higher in}} Malawi and Zambia than in South Africa. We examined whether different monitoring of ART (viral load [VL] in South Africa and CD 4 count in Malawi and Zambia) could explain this <b>mortality</b> <b>difference.</b> Design: Mathematical modelling study {{based on data from}} ART programmes. METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation model to study the effect of VL monitoring on mortality over 5 years. In baseline scenario A all parameters were identical between strategies except for more timely and complete detection of treatment failure with VL monitoring. Additional scenarios introduced delays in switching to second-line ART (scenario B) or higher virologic failure rates (due to worse adherence) when monitoring was based on CD 4 counts only (scenario C). Results are presented as relative risks (RR) with 95 % prediction intervals and percent of observed <b>mortality</b> <b>difference</b> explained. RESULTS: RRs comparing VL with CD 4 cell count monitoring were 0. 94 (0. 74 - 1. 03) in scenario A, 0. 94 (0. 77 - 1. 02) with delayed switching (scenario B) and 0. 80 (0. 44 - 1. 07) when assuming a 3 -times higher rate of failure (scenario C). The observed mortality at 3 years was 10. 9 % in Malawi and Zambia and 8. 6 % in South Africa (absolute difference 2. 3 %). The percentage of the <b>mortality</b> <b>difference</b> explained by VL monitoring ranged from 4 % (scenario A) to 32 % (scenarios B and C combined, assuming a 3 -times higher failure rate).

Due {{to the increase}} in consensual unions, living alone and other changes in living arrangements, it is necessary to apply a more detailed classification of living arrangements that incorporates partnership situation and household composition. Methods We analyse mortality by cause-of-death in the total Finnish population aged 30 or over in 1996 – 2000. The linked register dataset includes 15. 7 million person-years and 210 139 deaths. Results In the working aged population, cohabiters had nearly 70 % excess mortality when compared with married people. Among working aged men living with someone other than a partner and among men living alone, mortality was three times higher than among married men. Among women, mortality in these groups was close to that of cohabiters. In the older population, mortality in the other groups was 15 – 40 % higher than among married persons. Adjusting for education, social class and employment status attenuated the <b>mortality</b> <b>differences</b> by 7 – 31 %. Having no children was associated with excess mortality in working aged women and men in each living arrangement group.

However, the empirical evidence does not show a clear international relationship between such country features and health inequality. Denmark and the USA are analyzed in terms of socioeconomic differences in mortality for men above age 58. The data sources are Danish register data from 1980 and 2002 (n= 938. 427), and survey data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1992 to 2006 (n= 9374).

Income is the most important predictor for mortality. Surprisingly, mortality differentials are larger in Denmark than in the USA, with the richest 75 percent of Danish men having only 30 percent of the mortality risk of the poorest 10 percent.
