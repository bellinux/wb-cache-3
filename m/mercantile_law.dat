5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind <b>mercantile</b> <b>law</b> of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1878, a {{provision}} later known as section 5 of the Civil Law Act was introduced into Straits Settlements law. The provision stated {{that if a}} question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to <b>mercantile</b> <b>law</b> generally, the law to be administered {{was to be the}} same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless other provision had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire. However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally. Despite major amendments to the provision in 1979, the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 (...) [...]|$|E

40|$|Along {{the shores}} of the Indian Ocean, trade {{relations}} between the people of the Asian, Arabian and East African coasts were innumerable and deeply interlinked for centuries. Such links and relationships of trade and power were in those elements that composed the close equilibrium of the Indian Ocean: the monsoons, the presence of commercial thalassocracies (the well known merchant-states), the predominance of <b>mercantile</b> <b>laws,</b> and the trade routes of numerous precious goods. Maritime coastal trades, as well as long distance trades, represented the expressions of an economy that was already highly sophisticated, developed and organized; therefore, the necessity of control of these sea trade routes was a crucial element: a political element. Starting from the eighteenth century onwards, groups from the interior gradually began to settle on the coastal new centres. Two clearly distinct political realities were destined to co-exist along the coasts of South West Asia and, in particular, in the desolate, desert region of Balōčistān, in ‘Omān and in Sub-Saharan East Africa: the complex, multi-ethnic mercantile societies of the coasts, and the tribal, pastoral societies of the interior where, from time to time, the former succeeded in prevailing and imposing its laws. In the ports of these maritime corridors, small city-states prospered, their gaze directed mainly seawards, while larger reigns turned towards the interior and the north. The city-states jealously preserved their independence and attempts to make inroads on their commercial predominance often ended in failure for their enemies. The Arab potentates of the coasts thus created flourishing markets between the ports of South Western Asia and the Arabian, Western Indian, and East African coast. And, from the nineteenth century on, it was the red flag of the ‘Omānis that formed numerous ties between the ‘Omāni enclave of the port of Gwādar in Makrān-Balōčistān, the principal ports of ‘Omān itself, the East African coast, and the Island of Zanzibar (Unguja in Kiswahili) ...|$|R
