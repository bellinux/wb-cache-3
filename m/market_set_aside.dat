40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} aimed at placing {{employability}} {{in the context of}} a higher education submitted to progressive tensions due to the attempts to liken it to a mere subsidiary agency from the business world. After reviewing the reasoning on competences and skills, prioritized in the academic language in recent years, it can be stated that, for the sake of employability of students and graduates, the educational vision of learning should maintain its hegemony in the philosophy of action to follow. Internationalization is emphasized and theoretical dearth is addressed in relation to the connection between education performance and the labor <b>market,</b> without <b>setting</b> <b>aside,</b> obviously, the connection between employability and civil society organizations. We conclude that employability is inseparable from a good education, which trains professionals and citizens in support of a knowledge and innovative society. But we also warn against considering it as sole and exclusive means of the higher education...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} our {{reliance}} on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated {{and the previous}} estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60 % of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35 % from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5 % are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world <b>market</b> and <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} microeconometric methods {{are applied to}} explain the {{voluntary}} <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of arable land of Austrian farms. The descriptive {{analysis of the data}} shows {{that the majority of the}} small scale farms do not <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> arable land. But if they do <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> land, they <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> substantial shares. The microeconometric estimations confirm that the decision to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> consists of two steps. The first step is whether to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at all and the second step is how much to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The type of a farm has the biggest effect on the decision. Soil quality, the distribution of the soil quality, off farm work and the participation in the OÌˆPUL-program have significant, but generally small, influence as well. The results vary somewhat for different major production areas. If the two step model is used to calculate the expected <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of a farm, it generally is low as farms have low probabilities to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Most of the farms under the general regulation <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> small shares of arable land. That is due to the fact that every <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> that is more than the mandatory 10 percent is defined a voluntary <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Therefore, unfortunately, the statistical estimations are almost impossible to render and hence <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> is not as well explained by the model for farms under the general regulation as for the small scale farms. The main conclusion of the research is that there were no factors that lead to massive <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> This can be interpreted as a sign that cultivating arable land generally still pays in Austria. ...|$|R

40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} Management of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> {{is applied}} to arable lands subjected to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and kept non-cultivated throughout the year. The standard is also applied to other <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas eligible for direct payments. For the implementation of this Standard, the farmer must assure the presence of natural or artificial green cover on the surface throughout the year and adopt consistent agronomic practices as mowing, or other equivalent, {{in order to maintain}} the normal state of soil fertility, protect wildlife, prevent the formation of a potential inoculum of fires, especially during drought and prevent the spread of weeds. Up to the CAP Health Check the legislation on the <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> required the farmer to plough the soil by mid-May. Therefore, the natural vegetation cover could neither establish nor express its value against erosion throughout the year. Since mid 2004, cross compliance has banned ploughing of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> surfaces. This novelty is very important in relation to the effectiveness of the standard in erosion control. In Italy there are only few studies carried out in the field that have measured the effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> on soil erosion. The few existing experiments regarded the effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> managed in accordance with the CAP dictates prior to the CAP Health Check. The results of case studies show very contrasting results regarding soil erosion on <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> plots managed through the annual ploughing in the period in which this rule remained in force. This finding can be explained by considering that most of soil erosion in the Mediterranean environment is determined by extreme events; so, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> resulted ineffective in protecting the soil, when very erosive events occurred on bare soil (soil in seed bed condition after ploughing and harrowing) or when the plant cover of soil was still scarce. In these conditions soil erosion rate resulted similar to that observed in the intensive cropping systems. On the contrary, for events occurred when the natural vegetation was sufficiently developed, the beneficial effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> in limiting erosion was similar to that exerted by total grass cover. In general, it can be argued that on plough <b>set</b> <b>aside,</b> an average period of 2 months is needed for the establishment of natural cover sufficient enough to ensure a significant protection of soil from erosion. The results show that in Italy <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> before the CAP Health Check might have determined a decrease of soil erosion by 50 % (on average). Since 2005, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> under cross compliance regime appears to have had a greater beneficial effect than before in reducing erosion, as total grass cover was able to decrease soil loss by 98 % compared to intensive farming systems...|$|R

40|$|Negative {{consequences}} of intensive forest management on biodiversity are often mitigated by <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> old forest, but alternative strategies have been suggested. We have compared using simulations the {{consequences of}} two of these alternatives âˆ’ <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young forests or extending rotation periods âˆ’ to that of current practice in managed boreal forest. In all scenarios we applied a constant conservation budget and predicted forest development and harvesting over 200 years. As a proxy for biodiversity conservation, we projected the extinction risk of a dead wood-dependent beetle, Diacanthous undulatus, in a 50 km 2 landscape in central Sweden, using a colonization-extinction model. During the first century, <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young forest stands rather than old stands increased extinction risk because young stands have lower habitat quality. However, habitat quality of young forests increased as they aged and they were much cheaper to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> than old stands. Therefore, the strategy allowed a larger set-aside area (within the budget constraint), resulting in lower extinction risk and harvested timber volumes in the second century. Prolonging rotations also decreased the extinction risk but was in the long-term less cost-effective. The most cost-effective strategy in the long-term (200 years) was to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> a mixture of old and young forest. However, <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young stands rather than prolonging rotations or <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> old stands delays both the benefits (lower extinction risk) and costs (lost harvest volumes), so the optimal strategy depends on the assumed societal values and hence discount rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} forest management and biodiversity conservation has {{become more and more}} important in the last decades. The preservation of key habitats and ecologically valuable forests is recognized to be a goal in the planning process. Forest certification is a tool used to implement and achieve this objective. In Sweden the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification imposes to the forest owners who want to be certified, to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at least 5 % of their properties for biodiversity purposes. In southern Sweden this mechanism becomes very relevant, since the small private forest is {{the most common form of}} ownership. This thesis aims to investigate how much the conservation value of the <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas differs among different estates. Furthermore the presence of structures important for biodiversity in such small private forest estates is analysed, in particular comparing <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas and the most ecologically valuable non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas. The question that was tried to be answered was if the stands presenting the highest ecological and biodiversity values were those <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The study implementation consisted of inventorying ten estates certified according to FSC scheme and estimating the ecological value of the stands belonging to both, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas. A simplified biodiversity estimate was used where features representing the most important structures for forest biodiversity were checked. In particular different types of dead wood were surveyed and analysed, tree diameters (as a representation of old trees) and deciduous tree component. In addition an assessment of biodiversity potential was conducted in each stand, as a further variable which gives a score indicating the presence of valuable elements. The data analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the amount of dead wood between <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> stands. The only difference that was found was in the amount of lying dead trees, with a slightly higher volume for the non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> area. The field survey, combined with the biodiversity potential and the data revealed that in some cases low productive stands were preferred to stands with higher ecological characteristics in the <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> process. A lack of large trees was also noticed. In conclusion, as a general observation, it could be said that in certified small private forest estates, a good management of stands presenting high biodiversity potential is conducted. Yet here are elements that could be improved, like ensuring the percentage of the forest <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> fully corresponds to the most ecologically valuable area. Furthermore, the management could be done in a more efficient way, with more careful attention to substrates and element lacking in the landscape, such as large trees and deadwood...|$|R
