500|$|Higginbotham {{attended}} {{the opening of}} Johnson's Presidential library, where Johnson referred to Higginbotham as [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> advisers, sound, reliable, responsible." [...] Higginbotham would later {{say that he was}} thankful for the comment, but [...] "had the impression that there were probably a few hundred other people there who got that accolade." [...] Higginbotham met with Johnson two weeks before his death in 1973, along with then newly elected Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, to discuss Jordan's career in the House.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, {{at the age}} of 67, {{he retired}} to his [...] farm across the Delaware River in Moorestown, New Jersey which mostly {{produced}} grain. [...] He {{died of a heart attack}} in Mount Laurel, New Jersey on June 17, 1961. Former Vanderbilt quarterback Tommy Henderson said after learning of Cody's death: Josh was one of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends until he went to Temple. After that I'm afraid we lost contact. He had a lasting influence on the men who played for him. He was kind and considerate but demanding, too. He was a fine defensive basketball coach who believed in aggressive defensive fundamentals. In football, he was respected for what he knew and what he could do with his material." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} job at Kentucky, Collier said he was unsure {{what he would do}} next. [...] "Right now I feel I would like to remain in {{football}} if the opportunity presents itself," [...] he said. Two weeks later, Brown brought him back onto the Cleveland Browns staff as an offensive assistant. Collier and Brown had remained close friends during his time at Kentucky. Collier attended the Browns' training camps in Ohio during the summers, and Brown's family visited Collier on occasion in Lexington. Collier said he was happy to be back with the Browns, saying it was [...] "like returning home". Brown praised Collier's teaching and called him a [...] "scientific football man" [...] and [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends".|$|E

500|$|In July 2015, Isenhour {{replaced}} Katie McGinty as Wolf's Chief of Staff, after McGinty resigned {{six months}} into her tenure {{to pursue a}} campaign for U.S. Senate. Wolf called Isenhour [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> advisors" [...] and [...] "a valuable part of my administration", and said she [...] "really understands how {{the politics of this}} place actually works." [...] The selection was praised by both parties, including House and Senate Republicans, who expressed hope she would be less adversarial than McGinty. The Butler Eagle wrote an editorial criticizing the appointment due to her position on the Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania board, in light of a national controversy over undercover videos about the group's alleged sale of aborted fetal body parts. Isenhour came into the Chief of Staff position more than three weeks into a budget impasse between Wolf and the Republican-controlled General Assembly.|$|E
500|$|Livingstone now had [...] "the {{largest and}} most direct mandate of any {{politician}} in British history", receiving an annual salary of Â£87,000. It was the Mayor's job to oversee a number of subordinate bodies, including the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London (TfL), the London Development Agency, and the London Fire Brigade, {{and in doing so}} he was granted a number of executive powers. He would be scrutinised by the elected London Assembly, whose first chairman was Trevor Phillips, a Labour politician who had a reciprocated dislike of Livingstone. Livingstone was permitted twelve principal advisers, many of whom were members of Socialist Action or people whom he had worked with on the GLC. Ross and Fletcher became two of his closest confidants, with Livingstone commenting that [...] "They aren't just <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> political advisers... they're also mostly my best friends." [...] In 2002, he promoted six of his senior aides, resulting in allegations of cronyism from Assembly members. The Mayoral office was initially based in temporary headquarters at Romney House in Marsham Street, Westminster, while a purpose-built building was constructed in Southwark; termed City Hall, it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2002, with Livingstone commenting that it resembled a [...] "glass testicle." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Light Up" [...] {{features}} loud synth {{drums and}} plaintive piano strings. The Jay-Z-collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry, its detrimental effects, and {{the trappings of}} being an artist: [...] "While all <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to," [...] while Jay-Z gives advice: [...] "Drake, here's how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds, trying to distract you." [...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty." [...] "Cece's Interlude" [...] has a Prince-like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl: [...] "I wish I / Wasn't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / So that I could have you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy." [...] The pop song [...] "Find Your Love" [...] was produced by Kanye West and bears similarity to his 2008 song [...] "Heartless".|$|E

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the death}} of their daughter, Van became {{increasingly}} reclusive; Crosby never spoke publicly about being a mother, aside from mentioning it in a few interviews towards the end of her life: [...] "Now I am going to tell you of something that only <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends know. I became a mother and knew a mother's love. God gave us a tender babe but the angels came down and took our infant up to God and to His throne". In late 1859, the van Alstynes moved frequently, [...] "establishing a pattern that continued {{for the rest of their}} lives", and never owned their own home, living in rented accommodation without a lease.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 March 2005 Paul Hester {{was found}} dead, after hanging himself {{from a tree}} in a park {{near his home in}} Melbourne. He was 46years old. His {{obituary}} in The Sydney Morning Herald stated that he had fought [...] "a long battle with depression." [...] Following the news of Hester's death, Nick Seymour joined The Finn Brothers on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where the three played in memory of Paul. A snare drum with a top hat on it stood {{at the front of the}} stage as a tribute. Writing in 2010 Neil Finn said, [...] "When we lost Paul it was like someone pulled the rug out from underneath everything, a terrible jolt out of the dark blue. He was the best drummer I had ever played with and for many years, <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friend." ...|$|E

Out of the church, they meet MacLeod who defeats two of them. Darius, who has just revived, urges MacLeod to spare the third one, who flees. Darius is truly pained {{by the death of}} his own murderer, while MacLeod feels he has done well by ridding the world of a killer. He frustratedly admits that he is unable to follow Darius' teachings. Darius sadly realizes that MacLeod is leaving him to go to America, away from the hatred of Europe. Back in the present, MacLeod protects Paulus' life. After meeting Grayson and realizing he will not stop chasing Paulus, he fights and beheads him. Then MacLeod leaves Seacouver for Paris and meets Darius again. Learning of Grayson's death, Darius comments, [...] "He was once <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friend on earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|She remembered {{having a}} {{photographic}} memory as a child, {{making it easy}} to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests. She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy childâthat I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E
2500|$|Vice President Joe Biden {{recalled}} Byrd's {{standing in}} the rain with him as Biden buried his daughter when Biden had just been elected to the Senate. He called Byrd [...] "a tough, compassionate, and outspoken leader and dedicated above all else to making life better {{for the people of}} the Mountain State." [...] President Barack Obama said, [...] "His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator." [...] Senator Jay Rockefeller, who had served with Byrd since 1985, said, [...] "I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone." [...] Former President Jimmy Carter noted, [...] "He was <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> and most valuable adviser while I served as president. I respected him and attempted in every way to remain in his good graces. He was a giant among legislators, and was courageous in espousing controversial issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, Iâm not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
