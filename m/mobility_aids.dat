25|$|The {{progression}} of SPS {{depends on whether}} it is a typical or abnormal form of the condition and the presence of comorbidities. Early recognition and neurological treatment can limit its progression. SPS is generally responsive to treatment, but the condition usually progresses and stabilizes periodically. Even with treatment, quality of life generally declines as stiffness precludes many activities. Some patients require <b>mobility</b> <b>aids</b> due to the risk of falls. About 65 percent of SPS patients are unable to function independently. About ten percent of SPS patients require intensive care at some point; sudden death occurs in about the same number of patients. These deaths are usually caused by metabolic acidosis or an autonomic crisis.|$|E

The robot <b>mobility</b> <b>aid,</b> PAM-AID, is a “smart walker ” that aims to assist the frail and elderly blind to walk safely indoors. The Bayesian network combines user input with high-level information derived from the sensors to provide a context-aware estimate of the user’s current navigation goals. This context-aware action selection mechanism facilitates {{the use of a}} very simple, low bandwidth user interface, which is critical for the elderly user group. The PAM-AID systems have been evaluated through a series of field trails involving over 30 potential users. KEY WORDS—mobility aid, robot, visually impaired, Bayesian networks, context aware 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{context of}} this work is the {{development}} of a <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> for visually impaired persons. We present here an original approach for a real time alerting system, based on the detection of visual salient parts in videos. The particularity of our approach lies in the use of a new feature map constructed from the depth gradient. A distance function is described, which takes into account both stereoscopic camera limitations and user’s choices. We also report how we automatically estimate the contribution of conspicuity maps, which enables the unsupervised determination of the final saliency map. We demonstrate here that this additional depth-based feature map allows the system to detect salient regions with good accuracy in most situations, even in the presence of noisy disparity maps.

40|$|A {{project to}} develop an {{effective}} <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> for blind pedestrians which acquires consecutive images of the scenes before a moving pedestrian, which locates and identifies the pedestrian's path and potential obstacles in the path, which presents path and obstacle information to the pedestrian, and which operates in real-time is discussed. The <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> has three principal components: an image acquisition system, an image interpretation system, and an information presentation system. The image acquisition system consists of a miniature, solid-state TV camera which transforms the scene before the blind pedestrian into an image which can be received by the image interpretation system. The image interpretation system is implemented on a microprocessor which has been programmed to execute real-time feature extraction and scene analysis algorithms for locating and identifying the pedestrian's path and potential obstacles. Identity and location information is presented to the pedestrian by means of tactile coding and machine-generated speech...|$|R
40|$|MSc(E. ng) Dissertation 17 December 1989 At present {{there exists}} no {{adequate}} <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> designed for rural areas in Southern Africa and paraplegics have difficulty in negotiating rough ground with conventional wheelchairs. Specifications for a suitable <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> were developed after interviewing paraplegics in Lesotho and Bophuthatswana, and after conducting tests by personally riding a conventional wheelchair in those areas. After considering various options, a four-wheeled chain driven vehicle {{was chosen because}} it satisfies most of the specifications. The proposed design is a compromise which emphasises improved mobility outdoors. It is able to enter houses, climb gradients of 1 : 5 and will cost about R 700 to manufacture. A prototype was built and initial tests indicated the need for some modifications but confirmed the main advantages. However, further trials {{will be needed to}} test the robustness of the design before considering subsequent development...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiative}} to understand patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has increased to improve glaucoma management. We sought to identify important predictors of four PROs: {{social support and}} community integration, presence of depressive symptoms, vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) and preference-based Health-Related quality of life (HRQoL). A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients in London, Ontario (n= 250). Regression models, and classification and regression trees were built. Leave-one-out cross-validation assessed the models’ predictive performance. <b>Mobility</b> <b>aid</b> use, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), income and living arrangements were predictors identified for VRQoL, and social support and community integration. <b>Mobility</b> <b>aid</b> use was also predictive of depressive symptoms, and BCVA for preference-based HRQoL.

40|$|Background. The {{incidence}} of osteoporotic fractures increases by 1 - 3 % per year of age. Nine to twelve {{percent of patients}} that have suffered a primary hip fracture will have a fracture of the contralateral hip within 5 years. Our objective is to identify predictive factors of contralateral hip fractures among men and women over 55 years of age. Methods. A case control study with matched pairs was conducted, through a retrospective chart review of patients admitted for hip fractures at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and the Montreal General Hospital (MGH) between 1992 and 2004. Results. Contralateral hip fractures were most strongly {{associated with the use}} of <b>mobility</b> <b>aid</b> (OR= 5. 69, CI 95 % (3. 20 - 10. 14)). No other risk factors could be identified as predictors, probably due to missing data. Conclusion.

Future prospective risk studies may further optimize the diagnostic accuracy for predicting contralateral hip fractures...|$|R
