40|$|On {{global and}} European scale, {{maternal}} and child's health is proposed {{as one of}} the top-priority indicator of public health and welfare. In general, national welfare, social development and health are characterised by the birth and infant mortality rates. Having evaluated these indicators, it may be concluded that in Latvia since 2012 the birth rate is increasing from year to year, whereas the infant mortality rate is gradually decreasing verging on the average rate of the European Union member states in 2014. The birth rate depends very heavily on the country's economic situation within a specific period of time and the parents' readiness to undertake child rearing, whereas the infant mortality rate is more connected with the maternal and child health condition as well as the availability of health care in the country. This Research analyses national policy instruments for the enhancement of maternal and child health {{in the last three years}} paying special attention to the <b>state</b> <b>support</b> to medication therapy for children in Latvia, taking into consideration that medicinal products constitute a significant element of health technologies. The results show possible correlation between application of <b>state</b> <b>support</b> instruments and improvement of child health indicators.
