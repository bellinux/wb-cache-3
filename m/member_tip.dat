40|$|Histone variants, {{including}} histone H 2 A. Z, {{are incorporated}} into specific genomic sites and participate in transcription regulation. The role of H 2 A. Z at these sites remains poorly characterized. Our study investigates changes in the chromatin environment at the Cyclin D 1 gene (CCND 1) during transcriptional initiation in response to estradiol in estrogen receptor positive mammary tumour cells. We show that H 2 A. Z is present at the transcription start-site and downstream enhancer sequences of CCND 1 when the gene is poorly transcribed. Stimulation of CCND 1 expression required release of H 2 A. Z concomitantly from both these DNA elements. The AAA+ family <b>members</b> <b>TIP</b> 48 /reptin and the histone variant H 2 A. Z are required to remodel the chromatin environment at CCND 1 as a prerequisite for binding of the estrogen receptor (ERa) {{in the presence of}} hormone. TIP 48 promotes acetylation and exchange of H 2 A. Z, which triggers a dissociation of the CCND 1 39 enhancer from the promoter, thereby releasing a repressive intragenic loop. This release then enables the estrogen receptor to bind to the CCND 1 promoter. Our findings provide new insight into the priming of chromatin required for transcription factor access to their target sequence. Dynamic release of gene loops could be a rapid means to remodel chromatin and t...|$|R

40|$|A casing-less down hole {{sampling}} system for acquiring a subsurface sample for analysis using an {{inductively coupled plasma}} system is disclosed. The system includes a probe which is pushed into the formation to be analyzed using a hydraulic ram system. The probe includes a detachable <b>tip</b> <b>member</b> which has a soil point mad a barb, with the soil point aiding the penetration of the earth, and the barb causing the <b>tip</b> <b>member</b> to disengage from the probe and remain in the formation when the probe is pulled up. The probe is forced into the formation to be tested, and then pulled up slightly, to disengage the <b>tip</b> <b>member</b> and expose a column of the subsurface formation to be tested. An instrumentation tube mounted in the probe is then extended outward from the probe to longitudinally extend into the exposed column. A balloon seal mounted {{on the end of}} the instrumentation tube allows the bottom of the column to be sealed. A source of laser radiation is emitted from the instrumentation tube to ablate a sample from the exposed column.
