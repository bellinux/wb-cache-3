40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of sex and {{oxytocin}} on approach behavior in mice elicited by empathy for the pain of another mouse. The approach behavior of a free mouse towards an enclosed mouse was measured during a 30 minute period. Sex differences in approach behavior were observed during the first experiment. Results showed that females approached mice in pain <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> mice <b>not</b> in pain, whereas this distinction between pain and no pain conditions was not present in males. We hypothesized that this effect may be mediated by a “tend and befriend” response to stress produced by oxytocin. Using the same experimental setup to measure approach behavior, oxytocin was administered by subcutaneous injection to female mice. We expected that female mice with increased oxytocin levels would approach a mouse in pain <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> a mouse <b>not</b> in pain. We also predicted that they would approach a mouse in pain more frequently <b>than</b> mice <b>not</b> injected with oxytocin. Results did not demonstrate effects of pain manipulation in the predicted direction. These results most likely stem from a number of unexpected side effects of high doses of oxytocin including its sedative effects. Studies such as these contribute to the larger goal of researchers to establish animal models of social relationships and emotion as a means of better understanding and treating social disorders in humans...|$|R

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. <b>More</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight.

Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E
5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not.</b> As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E
25|$|The precise rate is {{not known}} because {{a large number of}} miscarriages occur before pregnancies become {{established}} and before the woman is aware they are pregnant. In addition, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> those <b>not</b> experiencing bleeding. Some studies have attempted to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, although these would also not be representative of the wider population. A systematic review found that the cumulative risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks of gestation varied from 11% to 22% in studies assessing miscarriage rates. Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.|$|R

5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. <b>More</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
