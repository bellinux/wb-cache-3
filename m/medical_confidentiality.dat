In particular requirements arising out of legal statutes and common law judgements have greatly modified the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship in societies deriving their law from English origins. Despite this, confidentiality remains a value which the physician must strive to preserve. He cannot however do this without considering its effect upon possible innocent third parties...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{enactment}} of Law 20. 584 in April of 2012 promotes {{a change in}} the physician-patient relationship, with recognition of people's rights and duties in healthcare by all the health professional and entities. The legal obligation, and not only the ethical one, as it currently happens, for humane treatment and regard for the dignity of the sick, informed consent, <b>medical</b> data <b>confidentiality,</b> the possibility to reject treatments, etc., is established. This review analyzes the contents of this law, especially those parts affecting physicians. It exposes its limitations, especially those related to minors' consent, living wills and research in people with mental disabilities. It also highlights positive aspects such as the promotion of a humane healthcare. This Law begins to consider patients' autonomy shyly. However, from a bioethical viewpoint, there are still many issues to be perfected such as healthcare humanization, excellence of patient care, healthcare quality and medical professionalism, considering competence, social service, charity and solidarity. It is a first step that must be supplemented with a greater development of medical deontology, and the development of clinical and institutional bioethics...|$|R

50|$|Consumer {{privacy is}} a form of {{information}} privacy concerned with the relationship between business or merchant collection and dissemination of data and the public expectation of privacy, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. Consumer privacy concerns date back to the first commercial couriers and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. In modern times, the ethical codes of most professions very clearly specify privacy measures beyond that for the consumer of any service, including <b>medical</b> privacy, client <b>confidentiality,</b> and national security. Since most organizations have a strong competitive incentive to retain an exclusive access to these data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some security engineering measures to protect customer privacy.|$|R
5000|$|Collins {{was opposed}} by ALRANZ, the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners. A NZ Herald Digipoll showed that 71% of New Zealanders {{believed}} {{parents should be}} informed {{about whether or not}} their child was to have an abortion, with 60% believing this should be legally mandatory. This [...] "parental notification" [...] legislation was heavily defeated, as the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners objected that the abrogation of <b>medical</b> <b>confidentiality</b> would endanger pregnant incest survivors, and/or those within similar dysfunctional families and abusive parents. Another pro-life amendment was also defeated. It required the Abortion Supervisory Committee to collect statistics on how many abortions come from pregnancies caused by incest, and what happened to those young women after their abortion. Again, Parliament rejected this on the basis of abrogation of <b>medical</b> <b>confidentiality</b> for no evidence-based purpose.

40|$|A European {{approach}} for resource management and strategic planning has been {{implemented in the}} HOSCOM project of AIM by defining information standards needed across countries, {{as well as a}} methodology to measure resources and costs at the institutional and interinstitutional level. A Euro Health Data Base (EHDB) has been obtained in order to test data availability and comparability as well as to validate models through macrocomparisons using case-mix (DRG's, refined grouping, disease staging) and microcomparisons based on three diseases (cardiac valve replacement, diabetes mellitus and hip fracture). The EHDB's presently based on 274 164 medical record summaries sampled from 7 countries allowed us to build prototypes (using Clipper, Prolog and SQL) in order to export uniform aggregates in the different countries, with standard software tools for statistical comparisons.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} some of {{the potential}} issues that may arise during epidemics or other public health emergencies. It specifically focuses on legal and operational preparedness experiences at Emory University during the 2014 Ebola crisis. Emory University Hospital was the first health care facility in the U.

Although EVD has particularly frightening symptoms and a high mortality rate, its containment and treatment implicate similar legal, practical, and operational issues as other highly infectious and communicable diseases. These issues include laws related to: isolation and quarantine; travel restrictions; duties to treat highly infectious patients; implications of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA); health care workers’ rights to a safe working environment, workers’ compensation, <b>medical</b> leave; <b>confidentiality</b> protections afforded by the HIPAA Privacy Rule; disability protections for patients under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and crisis standards of care and negligence claims.

5000|$|The {{criminal}} justice perspective considers organ trade from a legal, judicial viewpoint. Though many statutes regarding organ trade exist, law officials {{have failed to}} enforce these mandates successfully. One barrier to enforcement {{is a lack of}} communication between medical authorities and law enforcement agencies. Often, enforcement officials' access to information regarding individuals involved in illegal organ transplants is hindered by <b>medical</b> <b>confidentiality</b> regulations. Without the ability to review medical records and histories to build an effective case against perpetrators, officials cannot fully enforce organ trade laws. [...] Many critics state that in order to prohibit illegal organ trading effectively, {{criminal justice}} agencies must collaborate with medical authorities to strengthen knowledge and enforcement of organ trade laws. Critics also support other criminal justice actions to meet this goal, such as prioritizing organ trafficking issues among local legislative bodies; multidisciplinary collaboration in cross-border offenses; and further police training in dealing with organ trafficking crimes.|$|E
