40|$|The {{expression}} of doubt and certainty {{is crucial in}} academic writing where the authors have to distinguish opinion from fact and evaluate their assertions in acceptable and persuasive ways.

The present work aimed to determine the immunostimulatory effects of CpG-ODN class C in T. evansi infected rabbits. Rabbits inoculated with CpG C and challenged with T. evansi resulted in delayed onset of clinical signs with reduced severity in comparison to that of T. evansi infected rabbits.

40|$|The {{optimized}} {{design of}} outdoor insulators that consider heavy icing and pollution conditions {{is a significant}} concern for the reliability of power networks. Based on field observations, the probability of flashover of EHV post insulators is higher than line insulators under the same heavy icing conditions.

A booster shed (BS) is a flexible c-shape device made of high-quality insulating materials.

50|$|The basic {{limitation}} of HOIC {{is that it}} requires a coordinated group of users {{to ensure that the}} attacks are successful. Even though it has allowed attacks to be launched by far fewer users than the older Low Orbit Ion Cannon, the HOIC still requires a minimum of 50 users to launch an effective attack and more are required to sustain it if the target website has protection. Another limiting factor is the lack of anonymizing and randomizing capability. Even though the HOIC should, in theory, offer anonymizing through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>booster</b> files, the actual protection provided is not enough. Furthermore, anonymizing networks such as TOR are not capable of handling the bandwidth of attacks generated by the HOIC. Any attempt to launch an attack using the TOR network will actually harm the network itself. However, Anonymous members routinely use proxy servers based in Sweden to launch their attacks. It has been speculated that {{this is due to the}} notion that Sweden may have stricter internet privacy laws than the rest of the world.|$|R
40|$|Purpose of review: Forest {{models are}} tools for {{analysis}} and prediction of productivity and other services. Model outputs {{can only be}} useful if possible errors in inputs and model structure are recognized. However, errors cannot be quantified directly, making uncertainty inevitable. In this paper, we aim to clarify terminological confusion around the concepts of error and uncertainty and review current methods for addressing uncertainty in forest modelling. Recent findings: Modellers increasingly recognize that all uncertainties—in data, model inputs and model structure—can be represented using probability distributions. This has stimulated the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Bayesian methods for quantifying and reducing uncertainty and error in models of forests and other vegetation. The Achilles’ heel of Bayesian methods has always been their computational demand, but solutions are being found.

40|$|BACKGROUND Pneumococcal disease {{constitutes}} a major global health problem. Adults aged 50 {{years or older}} and younger adults with specific chronic health conditions are at particular risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In Europe, two types <b>of</b> vaccines are <b>used</b> in adults for pneumococcal immunization: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13). The {{aim of this study}} is to provide an overview and compare the national guidelines for pneumococcal immunization for adults in Europe. METHODS In November 2016, national guidelines on pneumococcal vaccination for adults of 27 European countries were obtained by Google search, the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and contacting public health officials. In our analysis we distinguished between age-based and risk-based guidelines. RESULTS We observed great variability regarding age, risk groups, vaccine type and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>boosters.</b> In age-based guidelines, vaccination is mostly recommended in adults aged 65 years or older, using PPV 23. A booster is generally not recommended. An upper age limit for vaccination is reported in two countries.

In the population with chronical health conditions, there is more heterogeneity according vaccine type, sequence and administration <b>of</b> <b>boosters.</b> Asplenia is the only comorbidity for which all countries recommend vaccination.
