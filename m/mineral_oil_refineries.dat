40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the role of CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) {{technologies}} in reducing CO 2 emissions from the European industry sectors. Emphasis is here placed on three branches of industry with promising prospects for CCS; <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>refineries,</b> iron and steel, and cement production. A relatively small number (~ 270) of large installations (> 500 000 tCO 2 /year) dominates emissions from these three branches. Together these installations emit 432 MtCO 2 /year, 8 % of EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. If realizing the full potential of emerging CO 2 capture technologies some 270 - 330 Mt CO 2 emissions could be avoided annually. Further, several regions have been singled out as particularly suitable to facilitate integrated CO 2 transport networks. The best matches between sources and sinks are currently found in regions bordering the North Sea...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the outcome of}} a workshop (the Mutual Joint Visit for Seveso Inspections) hosted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment of the Netherlands in November 2006 on ¿enforcement in Seveso II enterprises¿ in particular, a subject that has never been dealt with at EU level before. The ¿Table of Eleven¿ was used as model in order to facilitate and encourage discussion. The Table of Eleven is a model based on behavioural sciences consisting of eleven dimensions, or factors, which are decisive for the level of compliance with legislation. The use of the Table of Eleven requires the definition of and focus on ¿target groups¿ and ¿rules¿¿. Five specific target groups were selected: <b>Mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>refineries,</b> the pharmaceutical industry, fertilizer production, chemical batch processing, and LPG storage. Five specific rules were selected: 1) ¿The requirement of submitting a notification¿ (ref. Article 6 sub 1); 2) ¿Major accident scenarios¿ (ref. Article 9 and Annex II sub IVa); 3) ¿Assessment of the extent and severity of consequences¿ (ref. Article 9 and Annex II sub IVb); 4) ¿The identification of training needs¿ (ref. Article 7, 9 and Annex III sub c. i); and 5) ¿Procedures for management of change¿ (ref. Article 7, 9 and Annex III sub c. iv). The workshops discussions produced several interesting and useful conclusions concerning the enforceability of the Seveso Directive in general, and differences in compliance drivers in different sectors and across the Member States. On the basis of these conclusions, several recommendations were generated for European, national and inspectorate level regarding the improvement of enforcement strategies, tools and the results of the analyses performed in this workshop overall and by industry sector and by rule.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the role of CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) {{technologies}} in the reduction of CO 2 emissions from European industries. Design/methodology/approach – A database covering all industrial installations included in the EU ETS has been created. Potential capture sources have been identified and the potential for CO 2 capture has been estimated based on branch- and plant-specific conditions. Emphasis is placed here on three branches of industry with promising prospects for CCS: <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>refineries,</b> iron and steel, and cement manufacturers. Findings – A relatively small number (~ 270) of large installations (> 500, 000 ?tCO 2 /year) dominates emissions from the three branches investigated in this study. Together these installations emit 432 ?MtCO 2 /year, 8 percent of EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. If the full potential of emerging CO 2 capture technologies was realized, some 270 - 330 ?MtCO 2 emissions could be avoided annually. Further, several regions have been singled out as particularly suitable to facilitate integrated CO 2 transport networks. The most promising prospects for an early deployment of CCS are found in the regions bordering the North Sea. Research limitations/implications – Replacement/retrofitting of the existing plant stock will involve large investments and deployment will take time. It is thus important to consider how the current industry structure influences the potential to reduce CO 2 in the short- medium and long term. It is concluded that the age structure of the existing industry plant stock and its implications for the timing and deployment rate of CO 2 capture and other mitigation measures are important and should therefore be further investigated. Practical implications – CCS has been recognized as a key option for reducing CO 2 emissions within the EU. This assessment shows that considerable emission reductions could be achieved by targeting large point sources in some of the most emission-intensive industries. Yet, a number of challenges need to be resolved in all parts of the CCS chain. Efforts need to be intensified from all stakeholders to gain more experience with the technological, economical and social aspects of CCS. Originality/value – This study provides a first estimate of the potential role for CO 2 capture technologies in lowering CO 2 emissions from European heavy industry. By considering wider system aspects as well as plant-specific conditions the assessment made in this study gives a realistic overview of the prospects and practical limitations of CCS in EU industry...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVegetable oil {{was one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{lubricating}} oil before the discovery of petroleum. Nowadays, due to vegetable oil's poor performance at high temperatures and oxidation, it has not been widely used in the industrial sector. However, the fatty acids contained in vegetable oils may significantly reduce the frictional coefficient. To optimize lubrication, vegetable oil can be mixed with <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> In this paper, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) was mixed in <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and it lubricating properties were tested. Palm oil is one of the major vegetable oils produced in the world, and PFAD is one of the by-products of the palm <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> process. It is classified as a non-edible oil, and therefore, the increased use of this product for mechanical lubrication would not affect the production of cooking oil, the food chain or increase food prices. The mixing percentage (PFAD to <b>mineral</b> <b>oil)</b> varies from 5 % to 25 % of the total mass. Testing was conducted using a four-ball tribotester accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard 4172. The results show that by mixing a 20 % total mass of palm <b>oil</b> in the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> the coefficient of friction reached its lowest value. The wear scars on the ball bearings lubricated with this mix of oil also showed acceptable diameter values when compared to other conditions. From these results, it can be concluded that the performance of the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> could be enhanced by mixing it with vegetable <b>oil</b> (instead of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil).</b> However, the percentages should be determined properly...|$|R
