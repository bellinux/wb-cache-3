5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E

5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> with Down {{syndrome}} were institutionalized, few of {{the associated}} medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With {{the rise of the}} eugenics movement, 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. Action T4 in Nazi Germany made public policy of a program of systematic involuntary euthanization.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds. This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> of different ages. Like modern migratory herds, they would have had a significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence of {{herbivore}} {{remains and}} the similar {{state of preservation}} common to the <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie {{to conclude that the}} locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.|$|E

5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. <b>Many</b> <b>individuals</b> with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E

5|$|Mao {{was born}} on December 26, 1893 in his {{familiar}} home in the rural village of Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan county, Hunan Province, part of south-central China. Typical of many Hunanese villages, Shaoshanchong was situated in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. Both the village and the nearest town, Shaoshan, were named for the local Shaoshan Mountain ("Music Mountain"), a prominent feature in the local landscape with sacred associations for the region's Buddhists. The village was inhabited by <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> with the surname of Mao; the Mao clan traced their lineage back to Mao Taihua, a warrior from Jiangxi Province who had moved to Xiangtan county in the mid-fourteenth century after fighting for Zhu Yuanzhang's military campaign to overthrow the Mongol-governed Yuan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw {{was traded}} and hunted by Amerindians, and by Europeans after their {{arrival in the}} 15th century. <b>Many</b> <b>individuals</b> were brought to Europe as cagebirds, and 19 museum skins exist today. It had become rare by the mid-19th century due to {{pressure}} from hunting, trade, and habitat destruction. Hurricanes may also have contributed to its demise. The last reliable accounts of the species are from the 1850s on Cuba and 1864 on Isla de la Juventud, but it may have persisted until 1885.|$|E
5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}} {{was kept}} as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius, {{and although the}} bird was becoming scarcer, a number of specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed {{a wide variety of}} food, such as bananas, potatoes, and chayote, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. <b>Many</b> <b>individuals</b> survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.|$|E

5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. <b>Many</b> <b>individuals</b> develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, <b>many</b> <b>individuals</b> inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E
