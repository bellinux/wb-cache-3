In November 2013, O'Shaughnessy {{expressed an interest}} in representing the Republic of Ireland, stating that he feels [...] "more Irish than Finnish.

60|$|The other {{haunting}} intimations {{of change}} {{seemed to be}} elusively blended with sensations--the heat and thrill of action, the sense of something done and more to do, the utter vanishing of an old weary hunt for he knew not what. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been a hunt for work, for energy, for spirit, for love, for his real self. Whatever it might be, {{there appeared to be}} now some hope of finding it.|$|E

In the Western Hockey League they travel a lot and they need a good bus. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better wheels than I did." [...] Martin jokingly describes the bus he was traded for in 1983. He played one season with the Cougars in 1983-84, scoring 75 points in 60 games before turning professional. The draft pick of the Winnipeg Jets finished the 1983-84 season in the American Hockey League with the Sherbrooke Jets where he played five games. Martin remained in the AHL for much of the following three seasons, appearing in a total of 27 regular season and playoff games in the NHL over that time.

5000|$|In a 1986 {{interview}} with guitarist Dave Hill for the Slade fan club, Hill recalled {{his feelings about}} the album: [...] "There were very mixed opinions of the last album, from 'I like it' to 'I don't like it' - very, very bizarre. I personally think it lacked something. I mean {{it was a good}} sounding LP, but <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a bit too much quality. I think it lacked a certain amount of soul, or maybe guts. It wasn't a particularly enjoyable event for me personally. That wasn't anybody's particular fault in the band, it was just the process of things. Maybe it took too long. Perhaps it should have been much easier. I think that maybe too many of the songs on Rogues Gallery sounded like pop hits, so the album began to lean too much to being regarded as a sort of 'poppy' album, and there is nothing worse than that for me." ...|$|E

Apart from its well known manifestations involving the joints (e. g. deformity, swelling, synovial inflammation), there are widespread, extra-articular manifestations that also involve the cardiovascular (CV) system. The consequences of CV involvement are often serious; cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and CV disease (CVD) -associated death are up to 50 % higher in the context of RA leading to a reduction of life-expectancy in these patients of 3 - 10 years compared with the general population.

5000|$|The genre {{started to}} gain {{criticism}} {{at the height}} of its commercial popularity in 1999, particularly after the troubled Woodstock 1999 festival, which featured many rap metal and nu/alternative metal artists. Pop punk musician Jeff Brogowski told The Morning Call newspaper in 1999 that [...] "these macho rap-metal bands are just so mean-spirited. Look what happened at Woodstock (last summer). All the violence, looting and the fires. Something strange is going on. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> something do with all the economic prosperity.

She quit the play because she thought the play wouldn't be [...] "the best ever." [...] Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> been the best, but <b>it</b> might <b>have</b> been pretty good - and who knows, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> been the best ever.

The guy can be anywhere in time and space whenever and I suppose it helps, it's a useful tool to say this is where we are, we're back in London and this school is here; we're back in this specific area of London.

5000|$|... "We Think It's Love" [...] {{is a song}} by Leah Haywood, {{released}} as her debut single in early 2000. It is Leah's biggest hit off her debut album [...] "Leah" [...] staying in the Australian ARIA Top 50 singles chart for nearly up to five months. It was later covered by Swedish Idol contestant Nathalie Schmeikal. Co-written by Leah and Jorgen Elofsson, the song deals with a lover confronting his or her partner about their relationship that they cannot [...] "get it right" [...] and that <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> [...] "been going on far too long". The song has also been featured a few times on the popular Australian soap drama Neighbours and also on the soundtrack of the film What Women Want, and in the film itself.|$|R

[...] "When (Oasis) released Wonderwall, the rules of British music were decisively changed. From hereon in, the lighter-than-air ballad became obligatory, and the leather-trousers era of rock'n'roll was over." [...] The success of the album in Britain resulted in Oasis becoming a cultural ubiquity for a brief period, featuring in tabloid newspapers on an almost daily basis and breaking sales records for live concerts.|$|R

5000|$|... "Love to Love" [...] is {{considered}} to be in an alternate mix, even though as of 2001 it {{is by far the most}} commonly used mix to date.

2500|$|The {{initiative}} to dramatize the novel {{was taken by}} two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes. Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being tired of all Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that [...] "the story could have taken place, and <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> taken place. We all know that the Russians {{do what they want}} on Svalbard." [...] Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel it was in the scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris.|$|R
