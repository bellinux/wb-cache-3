500|$|Numerous {{problems}} {{occurred in}} the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the snowmobile intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in Dawson City until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked [...] to avoid a section of snowless trail, then {{had to deal with}} open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, [...] "I think it was 90percent (camping) trip and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of racing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could {{only be described as}} shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amberian Dawn {{classified}} {{themselves as}} [...] "melodic, dramatic and powerful metal with female classical vocals," [...] and ex-lead singer Heidi Parviainen has called their music [...] "fast tempo, guitar driven metal with purely classical female vocals", while several other sources classify them as symphonic power metal, which the band has agreed sums it up, but {{also points out}} that there are many different styles that vary from song to song. In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the '90s. There are a lot of technical skills within the band, so everyone who's not scared of serious guitar and keyboard shredding should listen to our music." ...|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic {{gave the}} album a mildly {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "amid the austerity of post-punk England, {{and before we}} became awash with irony and archness, we needed a band who could raise their eyebrows and smirk at it all without ever being condescending (or <b>maybe</b> only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> condescending)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Peter Scanavino was {{approached}} to portray Detective Dominick Carisi, [...] "a {{guy who has}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less polish...who <b>maybe</b> needs <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of refining".

500|$|In April 2013, James Valentine {{said the}} band was in the studio {{recording}} songs for the upcoming fifth studio album: [...] "The stuff we're working on now, it definitely has gone <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> darker in its sound, <b>maybe</b> back <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more to what we kind of did on Songs About Jane, {{but at this point}} we do have all kinds of different songs and it is early".|$|R
2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those}} things where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ben Bridwell {{described}} {{the sound of}} Cease to Begin, [...] "I guess the first record {{had some kind of}} country-ish leanings...I think there's <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more of that feeling on it, a little more down-home...not so much indie rock." ...|$|E
5000|$|Harman {{displayed}} a remarkable {{amount of energy}} into his 80s, staying active by playing golf and engaging in various other hobbies. He remained involved in the day-to-day management of Harman-Kardon until formally retiring on his 88th birthday in August 2006 and after turning 90 in 2008 remarked [...] "I don't feel much different than I did at 70. <b>Maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> but nothing has significantly diminished." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{at a rally}} {{which had}} been [...] {{disrupted}} by shouting Occupy Wall Street protestors, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum responded, [...] "People are allowed to protest and we respect their opinion.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with New York's Museum of Modern Art, Walker stated, [...] "I guess {{there was a little}} bit of a slight rebellion, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a renegade desire that made me realize at some point in my adolescence that I really liked pictures that told stories of things- genre paintings, historical paintings- the sort of derivatives we get in contemporary society." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Ellis-Bextor {{reflected}} on the album to Attitude magazine, saying [...] "The second album still had the same feel as the first, but it was <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> darker. During that record I {{was going through a}} bit of a break-up so there are a few break-up songs on there. I wasn't feeling quite as funny and breezy as I was on the first album, but I got it back on album three." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{began playing}} the upright bass fiddle, {{modeling}} his [...] "slap bass" [...] technique {{after one of}} his idols, Fred Maddox of Maddox Brothers and Rose. Black also developed a [...] "stage clown" [...] persona {{in the same way}} that Maddox entertained audiences. Black performed as an exaggerated hillbilly with blacked-out teeth, straw hat and overalls. According to his son, Black said his goal was always to give his audience [...] "a few moments of entertainment and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of humor that'll tickle 'em for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Developer listed Vreeland {{in their}} 2012 Power 50 {{for his work}} on the soundtrack, which they {{described}} as [...] "atmospheric, pensive, and <b>maybe</b> even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> melancholy".

5000|$|Lee {{describes}} the song by saying [...] "part {{of the human}} experience is the imperfection that goes with it." [...] Also she states [...] "everyone of us is broken in some way, shape or form. Even if you don't want to admit it, {{you have to be}} real with yourself.

5000|$|... "The {{song was}} {{written about the}} character, the Scorpion King, in the movie," [...] Erna {{explained}} {{on the set of}} the accompanying video. [...] "It's about him being this big, masculine badass, but he has this hidden sensitive side to him. He feels like he's isolated, and he likes to do things alone because he was hurt in the past or whatever. I don't really know why he is the way he is. I guess there's always this mystique about those people who are really tough but <b>maybe</b> feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> lonely inside. So the lyrics are kind of based on his character — being as masculine as he can be but yet isolated and a loner." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of the {{creative}} process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained [...] "We {{were interested in the}} psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don’t quite understand what’s up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too much love here and there. But, for me, there’s something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{announced}} on Fox & Friends on June 9, 2009, also repeated on Glenn Beck's Fox News program, that her parents' car dealership {{had been selected}} for closure {{as part of the}} General Motors reorganization and bankruptcy.

5000|$|... "I {{would like}} to think that people in England—and also around the world—don't take what they say as being [...] I {{actually}} had a lot of really good press, and so, as far as I can tell it was about time to give me a hard time, but, for me, the only way I can judge the shows was from the audiences' reactions and they were just great. And of course the outfits were a bit, <b>maybe,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too much, but that wasn't a mistake, that was meant to cause a bit of a stir." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Scanavino joined SVU in its sixteenth season, {{this time}} as Dominick Carisi, Jr., a new SVU detective.

According to SVU Executive Producer Warren Leight, [...] "(Detective Carisi) comes in SVU and shake things up...a guy who <b>maybe</b> needs <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of refining." [...] Scanavino noted that Carisi [...] "is a total outsider. He's brusque and he doesn’t really get the nuances and he's not very experienced so he puts his foot in his mouth a lot of times. But he's learning. He's picking it up. I think he’s a good detective, but he's {{got a lot to}} learn on how to... approach cases." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{began writing}} Teeth Dreams in June 2012. Prior {{to the writing}} process, Finn stated, [...] "It's hard to tell where the new one will go. ... I'm curious {{whether it will be}} an {{extension}} of Heaven is Whenever, or if it will be a return to what we did before." [...] Guitarist Tad Kubler elaborated, [...] "“The general consensus may have been that our last record felt like it was <b>maybe</b> rushed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> so I know speaking for myself personally, I want to be really careful not to do that - to be like, 'Oh shit, we need to get a record out and go on tour.’ Going into this, everybody realized {{that it was going to}} take as long as it takes." ...|$|R
500|$|Deemed Madonna's most girlish album yet, True Blue {{deals with}} Madonna's view of love, work and dreams {{as well as}} disappointments. According to Madonna, the title was from a {{favorite}} expression of her then husband Penn and his very pure vision of love. The album was her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. Most of its songs reflect this idea although each was developed separately. The first track, [...] "Papa Don't Preach", was written by Brian Elliot, who described it as [...] "a love song, <b>maybe</b> framed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> differently". The song is based on teenage gossip Elliot heard outside his studio, which had a large front window that doubled as a mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat.|$|R
5000|$|Kelliher {{also stated}} that the album's theme might be [...] "death". He stated the following: [...] "It always makes for really good story telling. It's kind of the theme {{that we have a}} lot in our music. We've had a lot of friends pass away since the last record. I'm not really sure yet. I think we're kind of {{focusing}} more about living on this earth and what would happen if this was your last year to live. I think that's sort of <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of what we might be kind of touching on." ...|$|E
5000|$|As far as {{the concept}} of the video goes, [...] "It's going to be a bit freaky," [...] says Eicca. [...] "It'll be surrealistic in many ways, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> in the spirit of Tim Burton. There's acrobats, strange-looking people doing strange things. It's going to be shot in an old house where nobody lives; it's a big mansion. It's really spooky. Of course, the director, Lisa Mann, is the only person who really knows at the moment, but it's {{exciting}} for us. She really wants to bring out the people inside the band. It feels completely different. It has a really special look." ...|$|E
5000|$|Green apple, carrot, celery, parsley, ginger, kale, <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{of lemon}} or something, but that’s a {{standard}} juice we make ... I {{think the best}} thing to do, even if you’re not vegetarian, is to juice vegetables. There’s no possible way to eat all that—you can’t consume it all. So you drink it and get all the nutrients, and also it gets in your body faster because your body doesn’t have to break it down or anything. Juicing {{is one of the best}} things to do to heal or replenish your body and get rid of all the toxins ... When I’d go on trips I’d just feel like shit and eat like shit ... I think I just feel healthier in general.|$|E
