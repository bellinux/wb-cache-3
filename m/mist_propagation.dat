40|$|Abstract- An {{experiment}} on Tinospora crispa cuttings using three cutting lengths, two hormone treatments and control (without hormone) {{was carried out}} in the nursery of Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). The length of cutting used was: 7. 5 cm, 15 cm and 22. 5 cm. The base of each cutting was treated with two types of powdered hormones: 1) Seradix 1 (0. 1 % indole butyric acid-IBA), 2) Seradix 2 (0. 3 % IBA) and 3) control (without hormone). These cuttings were planted in cleaned river sand medium in a non <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> system. Results twelve weeks after planting showed that cuttings of 22. 5 cm length produced significantly higher rooting (81 %) than the other two length (59 % and 38 %). Similar results were obtained with the number of roots where 22. 5 cm length had significantly most number of roots (1. 9) compared to the other two lengths (1. 3 and 1. 2). This experiment showed that Tinospora crispa can be propagated by cuttings as an alternative source of planting materials for domestication purposes.

The roadway in coal mine is very complex. So the related experiments need be considered. The light-sized experiment of the water mist is built for taking mine environment analog simulation with the pipeline. It is suppressed by medium pressure water mist the experiment of gas and coal dust explosion propagation in the alone laneway. Obstacle is laid on the different positions, whose blockage ratio is 30 %. Then we compare the effects of suppression on gas flame with the different location. The experimental results indicate that the obstacle is placed in the front, middle and end of <b>mist</b> area. The <b>propagation</b> velocity of gas flame is different. The gas content and blockage ratio is set low in experiment. It can achieve better inhibition effect that the obstacle is placed in the middle or end of water mist area. Thus, if the obstacle can’t be avoided in water mist system, the designer must consider the position of obstacle. It can enhance the suppression effect of water mist...|$|R

Organic materials such as hazelnut husk compost, farmyard manure, peat and inorganic materials such as perlite and pumice were used as rooting medium, with 2000, 4000 and 6000 mg kg - 1 IBA concentration. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with five media, four IBA doses with ten replicates under <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> in heated greenhouse conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} {{different}} concentrations of IAA exogenously applied to Proteaceae plants {{of the genus}} Leucadendron laxum {{on a variety of}} rooting medium were studied. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the rooting response of tip cuttings of nature-grown shrubs using an intermittent <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> system in a shaded tunnel. The IAA treatments included a control, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 ppm IAA auxins. The growth mediums tested were: a) bark/polystyrene (1 : 1); b) peat moss/polystyrene (1 : 1); c) bark/river sand /polystyrene (1 : 1 : 1); and d) perlite/river sand (1 : 1). Each treatment was replicated in ten pots. Overall, the exogenous supply of IAA had a positive effect in the advancement of rooting in L. laxum grown in a) peat/polystyrene and b) bark/river sand/polystyrene mediums. With regard to growth mediums, results indicated that the a) bark/ polystyrene and b) peat/polystyrene mediums were significantly superior in promoting different aspects of rooting when compared with the other mediums. Evidence from this study was conclusive that the shade tunnel was an economical and successful environment in rooting L. laxum...|$|E

40|$|Attempts to {{propagate}} Citrus species and varieties from stem cuttings have always met with varied results. Some types form roots readily {{enough to warrant}} using this method as a commercial operation. Other varieties and species have been extremely difficult, or impossible {{to propagate}} in this way, while a third group may be held to occupy an intermediate position. Modern technology has done much to improve the results obtained with stem cuttings {{of a wide range}} of plants. Improvements in selection of cuttings to provide materials with high potentials for root formation; improvements in environmental control, such as glasshouses, <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> units etc., and improved chemical treatments, have all acted to improve our ability to form roots in this way. Even with these improvements, however, the difficult-to-root species and varieties of Citrus give very poor response to attempts to propagate them from stem cuttings. From this, it might well be concluded that these are inherent factors responsible for the failure of such species and varieties to propagate from stem cuttings. Such factors could arise from anatomical differences between Citrus species and varieties, or differences in physiological conditions governing root formation. The physiological aspects could be in the presence or absence of compounds which either stimulate, or inhibit root formation on stem cuttings. The studies reported in this Thesis have been concerned with elucidating this latter type of problem...|$|E
40|$|The 'Ayvalik ' olive cultivar, {{the most}} grown for high quality {{olive oil in}} Turkey, is {{generally}} regarded as showing very good rooting ability. However, cuttings sometimes show moderate or even poor rooting performances, a problem likely related {{to the use of}} inappropriate rooting media. The aim of this work was to determine the most successful media among those traditionally used and to identify promising alternatives. October cuttings were planted in 25 different media in two consecutive years under <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> conditions. Substrates such as peat, perlite, bark, pumice, sand, polystyrene beads, phenolic foam, rockwool and vermiculite were used pure or in mixtures. In the first year the highest rooting per-centage (100 %) and visual rating scores (5) were obtained with phenolformaldehyde foam. Perlite-vermiculite (1 : 1 v/v) was associated with a 95 % rooting percentage in both years. The highest mean number of roots (10. 8), root length (47 mm), root dry (382 mg) and fresh weights (48. 3 mg), and number of secondary roots (13) were recorded in the same medium in the second year. Rockwool, peat-polystyrene (2 : 1 v/v) and sand-perlite (1 : 2 v/v) also led to more than 90 % of cuttings tak-ing root, while pure sand, peat and peat-sand mixtures gave very low (5 - 28 %) rooting percentages. Perlite-vermiculite 1 : 1 (v/v) and pre-sized rockwool cubes may be appropriate alternatives to traditional sand-perlite mixtures for rooting 'Ayva-lik ' olive cuttings...|$|E
40|$|Adventitious root {{formation}} in woody plants is highly {{influenced by the}} process of physiological ageing. There are increasing efforts to identify markers for distinguishing between mature and juvenile stages of trees. However, it appears to be very little information on this aspect at the chemical and molecular levels. The aim of the work was to identify potential chemical marker of juvenile and mature state; and accomplish maximum rooting in teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) leafy shoot cuttings. Experiments with teak leafy shoot cuttings of three different physiological ages 30 - and 15 -year-old (mature); and 2 -month-old (juvenile) were conducted in <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> system. Maturity of donor teak plants decreased rooting ability. Cuttings obtained from 2 -month-old donors rooted more profusely in comparison to 15 - and 30 -year-old donors. Indole- 3 -butyric acid treatment at 4000 mg L - 1 significantly increased rooting percentage and produced highest number of roots. High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of anthraquinones (AQs; C 14 H 8 O 2) was utilized to detect qualitative and quantitative differences in AQs in stem tissues from 2 -month, 15 - and 30 -year-old donor plants. The HPTLC analysis showed that AQs varied from 2. 8 to 18. 3 % in cuttings derived from 2 -month-old donor plants, while the variations were 4. 9 to 27. 3 % and 11. 8 to 43. 4 % in those from 15 - and 30 -year-old donor plants, respectively.

40|$|The rooting {{potential}} of four types or origins of Prunus avium cuttings {{from the same}} mature trees (over 20 years-old) was compared using a <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> bed during early Summer (June). The cuttings originated from juvenile sucker shoots of the current and previous year, and mature crown shoots (current year's lateral `long-shoots' and multi-year terminal `short shoots'). The morphological differences in inter-node length, stem diameter and leaf area between the four cutting types were highly significant (P = 0. 05), leading to large differences in cutting volume and, so it is argued, to assimilate reserves. Juvenile cuttings rooted well (65 % and 77 % rooting for hardwood and softwood shoots, respectively), while mature cuttings rooted poorly (4 % and 7 % for mature hardwood and softwood cuttings, respectively). Leaf abscission was significantly more frequent in mature hardwood cuttings (16 - 78 %) than in the other cutting types (1. 6 - 9 %) {{at the end of}} the propagation period. Leaf loss resulted from two processes: abscission and leaf rotting. Physiologically (i. e., in carbon assimilation, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance), the four cutting types were not significantly different early in the post-severance period (day- 4); but, by day- 22, stomatal conductance was lowest in mature hardwood cuttings that still had leaves. At this time, the most physiologically-active unrooted cuttings were from juvenile hardwood and mature softwood shoots. The extent of physiological and morphological variability between cutting types and their probable impact on processes affecting rooting ability is complex and highly interactive. Consequently, it is not possible to explain the causes of the variation in rooting ability between juvenile and mature cuttings, although this study suggests that the constraints to rooting are likely to reflect physiological differences between the different cutting types. It is concluded that, to resolve the debate about factors that affect the rooting ability of juvenile and mature cuttings (i. e., ontogenetic vs. physiological ageing), there is a need to achieve morphological and physiological comparability in the tissues...|$|E
40|$|Project TCP/ANT/ 4502 {{provided}} {{both technical}} advice and practical training in fruit crop propagation and orchard management, {{so as to}} assist the Government in planning and implementing its crop diversification programme. Some nursery equipment and materials were also providedAfter {{an assessment of the}} climatic and pedological conditions in Antigua, a number of areas were identified as suitable for fruit crops, including Christian Valley, Dunnings, Roses, Orange Valley, Cades Bay, Old Road, Body Ponds, Yorks and Sawcolts. On this basis, a number of mango, sweet orange, grapefruit, tangerine, avocado and breadfruit varieties were selected for further development. Factors to be considered were the varieties' suitability for local household consumption, the possibility of using the fruit in the tourist trade and for export, and the need to extend the harvest season over as long a period as possibleManagement practices in the government propagation nurseries and orchards in Christian Valley and Greencastle were reviewed and detailed guidelines wereformulated to improve the general management of the stations and the propagation of the various fruit species. The use of a better soil mixture and larger polybags, regular fertilization, and more regular watering through automatic watering systems, would greatly improve propagation. For hardwoods and semi-hardwoods, the replacement of the rooting medium in the propagation beds and automatic watering, and shade and wind protection would reduce the present mortality rate. A number of recommendations were made to improve the physical infrastructure of the stations and it was suggested that the use of softwood technologies would accelerate propagation and rapidly increase the planting material available: to achieve this, a mist propagator should be installed in Christian Valley, and propagation boxes at Greencastle, where a new greenhouse is needed for potting, rooting, and hardening operationsApart from these fruits, field trials were initiated to test a rapid propagation method for pineapple: these should be continued with the aim of overcoming the present shortage of pineapple plantsNational horticultural technicians were given training in the vegetative propagation of fruit trees, and selected technical officers received specialized training in <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> and orchard management in other Caribbean countries.

40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) is a {{priority}} species for plantation development in Papua New Guinea (PNG), although expansion of the planted area is constrained {{by a lack of}} high quality seed sources. To address this problem, clonal methods were used for capturing selected plus trees within existing plantations (9 candidates) and an existing clonal seed orchard (20 candidates). Truncheon cuttings were collected from the lower branches of each of the 29 candidate trees. Truncheons were cool-stored for 5 days during transportation before being planted in a potting medium that was a mixture of coarse sand and forest soil (at ratio 1 : 1 by volume) and placed under intermittent mist. Adventitious root development in the truncheons occurred over a period of 5 to 6 months, and successfully rooted truncheons were planted in a hedge garden and used as a further source for cuttings. Subsequent cutting experiments using softwood single-node cuttings evaluated the effects of (i) rooting media (coarse sand vs a mixture of coarse sand and coconut husk) in the non-mist propagators, and in the mist system, coarse sand, fine sand, jiffypot (coco pellets) and a mixture of perlite and coconut husk, (ii) cutting length (6, 8, 10 and 12 cm), and (iii) rooting ability of clones. After 12 weeks a significantly greater rooting percentage was recorded in a mixture of coarse sand and coconut husk (78 %± 3. 95 se) compared to coarse sand alone (52. 3 %± 2. 85 se) in the non-mist propagators. Rooting percentage variation did not differ significantly across the rooting media in the <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> system. However, a greater rooting percentage was attained in jiffypots (85 %± 0. 05 se) compared to in coarse (64. 6 %± 0. 07 se) and fine sand (65. 3 %± 0. 06 se). For the cutting length experiment, s significantly greater rooting percentage (94 %± 0. 04 se) was recorded with the cutting length of 10 cm compared with 6 cm (50 %± 0. 09 se) and 8 cm (53. 1 %± 0. 09 se) cutting lengths. At week 12 after insertion of cuttings in jiffypots, no significant variations in rooting percentages were found among the clones. Low rooting percentages were recorded across all clones. Nevertheless, cutting survival of these clones was significantly higher without producing roots at week 12 after insertion in jiffypots in the mist house. Clones obtained from leafy stem cuttings were successfully acclimatized and would be used in teak clonal seed orchard (CSO) establishment to become a source of high quality germplasm for planting in PNG...|$|E
40|$|Tomato aspermy virus (TAV) {{was found}} infecting more than 90 % of {{chrysanthemum}} plants collected from several gardens in the Hobart district. The virus is readily transferred by sap inoculation to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Hickory Prior) {{in which it}} causes a severe systemic disease, and real relative concentrations of infective particles in tobacco plants can be measured reliably on Chenopodium amaranticolor, a local lesion host, if certain procedures are adhered to. Tobacco plants may be freed from infection by growing them at a constant temperature of 36 C for between 5 and 30 days. The percentage of cures effected is generally greater if cuttings are taken from plants immediately after treatment and rooted in a <b>mist</b> <b>propagation</b> unit. A decreased rate of viral synthesis is {{one reason for the}} effectiveness of the method. Under normal conditions of heat treatment, virus multiplication could never be detected although some indirect evidence, from results with cytokinin applications to treated plants, suggested that limited multiplication still occurred. However, measurable synthesis did take place if heated plants were treated with actinomycin D. These observations, together with some additional information on rates of TAV accumulation in plant tissue under various conditions, support a concept of competition between the virus and its host for substrates and access to ribosomes. As ribosomal concentration falls markedly in plants undergoing heat treatment concomitant with an increase in host protein synthesis, an hypothesis is advanced that viral RNA competes poorly with host messenger RNA for the limited numbers of available ribosomes on which to synthesise their respective proteins. This concept may also be used to account for the successes in obtaining virus-free material from infected plants by meristem culture. The rate of virus inactivation in whole plants at 36 °c is much slower than the rate in expressed sap, and faster than the rate in purified virus preparations. Also, the kinetics of inactivation both 'in vivo' and in expressed sap do not fit a reaction of the first order, but one of a higher order, showing that inactivation at high temperature is not solely a direct thermal effect. Large increases in the levels of two enzymes, polyphenoloxidase and ribonuclease, occur during heat treatment and these may directly inactivate TAV. The extent of increase of these heat-induced enzymes may vary greatly with the species and variety of tobacco, thus providing an explanation for many past observations and suggestions implicating a role of the host in heat treatment therapy. Several observations indicates that the cytokinin concentration falls in heated plants. This results in an almost complete cessation of mitosis as well as a decrease in the ionic strength of the cell sap concomitant with a large increase in cell volume. The pH of the cell sap also falls markedly during heat treatment. probably reduce the stability of TAV. These changes The observations on alterations in cell size and mitotic activity are taken to negate the commonly advanced suggestion that heat treatment may be successful because the plant "grows away" from the virus. The results, and some conclusions drawn from them, offer several different mechanisms which may be important in achieving virus therapy by heat treatment. They allow one to predict the types of virus infections which might be cured by heat treatment, and suggest that exogenous application of certain chemicals to plants may be useful in increasing both plant survival and the chances of virus cure in "difficult plants. " A more rational approach to virus therapy by heat treatment should therefore be possible...|$|E
