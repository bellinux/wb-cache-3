5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land <b>Mover,</b> which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the <b>Mover</b> off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the <b>Mover</b> at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land <b>Mover</b> and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people <b>mover,</b> conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people <b>mover,</b> tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It would replace the shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E

40|$|If one writes “earth <b>mover’s</b> {{distance}} ” in Google {{one gets}} 6300 hits. The Earth <b>Mover’s</b> Distance is a distance measure between images. As a mathematical object the Earth <b>Mover’s</b> Distance {{goes back to}} the early 1940 s and work of L. Kantorovich on probability measures. As a measure for the distance between images it was used studied by M Werman {{in the middle of the}} 1980 s. In the 1990 s much work was done at the Image Coding Group (ICG) at Linköping University to find a fast algorithm for computing the Earth <b>Mover’s</b> Distance, or the Kantorovich distance for images as was the name used by ICG. In the year 2000, the paper “The earth <b>mover’s</b> distance as a metric for Image retrievel ” written by Y Rubner, C Tomasi and L. J. Guibas was published, and it was in this paper that the terminology Earth <b>Mover’s</b> Distance was first used in an international journal, and since then approximately 65 papers have been published in which one refers to the earth <b>mover’s</b> distance, and only around 10 papers in which one refers to the Kantorich distance or the Kantorovich metric. 2 Project purpose. A drawback with the earth <b>mover’s</b> distance is the rather long computation time. Since the year 2000, several papers have been published on algorithms for computing the earth <b>mover’s</b> distance. However none of these are aware of the work done at ICG in the 1990 s. There are two main goals of this project. The first is to implement an algorithm for 3 -dimensional images, based on the theory developed at the ICG in the 1990 s. The second goal is to use this algorithm for 3 -dimensional image matching. The second part of the project will be in cooperation with IMT (Institutionen för Medicinsk Teknik) ...|$|R

40|$|Counterurbanisation {{is often}} conceptualised as urban, middle-class <b>movers</b> {{attracted}} by an idyllic rural setting. However, knowing that rural areas {{differ in their}} popularity for living, we argue that more attention is required to the diversity of rural in-migration within countries. We do so by comparing the characteristics, motivations, and values of <b>movers</b> to popular and less-popular areas in the northern Netherlands using multivariate analysis on survey data (N= 1, 717). In contrast to earlier studies, {{we focus on the}} motivations for choosing the destination area instead of mixing those with motives for leaving. We also included residential history and values in our analysis. The differences between <b>movers</b> to the two types of areas appear to be less distinct than indicated by previous studies. Although popular areas more often attract middle-class <b>movers,</b> both areas attract urban <b>movers.</b> <b>Movers</b> to less-popular areas are more often motivated by low house prices and moving in with a partner, but <b>movers</b> to popular areas also mention instrumental considerations related to work and location. While the physical aspects of the environment are important to moving to popular areas, social aspects are more important to moving to less-popular areas. We find that values add to our understanding of counterurbanisation. It is not possible to relate two distinct groups of <b>movers</b> directly to different types of rural areas within countries. Future research into rural migration should be careful not to use too simplified understandings of counterurbanisation, both in general and with regard to different types of rural areas.

5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime <b>mover</b> were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
