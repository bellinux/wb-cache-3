5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E

The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called rapsods related the mythistory of kurbet before World War II with the migration. They make use of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> performance devices taken from oral folk poetry and death laments which react on the migrations to fix them in the memory of the community. This became a tool for responding to the loss of life for the tragedy of Otranto and other tragic events.|$|E

40|$|<b>Metaphor</b> <b>and</b> Simile {{are two of}} {{the figures}} of speech that take two {{different}} things by comparing one with another. The use of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile helps speakers or writers to give a clear description throughcomparison or contrast. The writer decided to analyze <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile figures of speech that use comparison makers such as like, as, as if in Song of Solomon. The problems of this research are focused on the kind and the meaning of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile found in Song of Solomon. The aims of the research are to identify, classify, and analyze the forms and the meaning of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile in Song of Solomon. The method used in this research is descriptive method. In collecting data, the writer focused on identifying the words, phrases, or parts of sentences. The result showed that the forms of metaphor employed in the verses of Song of Solomon can be categorized as anthropomorfis <b>metaphor,</b> animal <b>metaphor,</b> <b>and</b> sineshetic <b>metaphor,</b> based on Lakoff 2 ̆ 7 s theory, and the simile was analyzed based on Fromilhague 2 ̆ 7 stheory. In terms of the meaning <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile have similarity and dissimilarity. Similarity in <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile is the meaning of both figures of speech have the element of comparing two objects. <b>and</b> dissimilarity of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> simile is <b>metaphor</b> does not use the words of comparison, but simile uses the words of comparison such as: like, as, as if...|$|R
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
40|$|Figurative language, such as <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> metonymy {{are common}} in our daily communication. This {{is one of the}} first studies to {{investigate}} <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> metonymy comprehension using a developmental approach. Forty-five typically developing individuals participated in a metaphor-metonymy verbal comprehension task incorporating 20 short picture-stories. Cross-sectional trajectory analyses linking task performance to either chronological age or receptive vocabulary (mental age, MA) were used to compare the development of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> metonymy. Results showed that development of <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> metonymy comprehension is strongly linked with chronological <b>and</b> MA, but <b>metaphor</b> comprehension develops at a slower rate compared to metonymy. It was also found that participants, across all ages, consistently showed around 21 % better performance on metonymy. The relationship between <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> metonymy comprehension is discussed in terms of linguistic and cognitive models of figurative language comprehension arguing that metonymy is cognitively more basic than metaphor...|$|R

5|$|Eleusis is {{probably}} Abbott's most prominent game, {{due to its}} <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> its suitability {{for use as a}} teaching tool. He invented it in 1956, and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games. It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later. Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June1959 issue of Scientific American. Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis; the result was considered to be far better than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a bit better. Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October1977 issue of Scientific American. Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis. It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games, among others.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
