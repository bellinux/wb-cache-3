5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as <b>marjoram</b> and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but {{declined}} after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as <b>marjoram,</b> savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, <b>marjoram,</b> hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, <b>marjoram,</b> tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, <b>marjoram</b> and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
25|$|Flaki or Flaczki - Beef or pork tripe stew with <b>marjoram.</b> Common {{ingredients}} include beef tripe, beef, bay leaf, parsley, carrot, beef broth, {{and spices}} to taste, including salt, black pepper, nutmeg, sweet paprika, and <b>marjoram.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adults feed {{primarily}} on nectar of Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), Knapweeds (Centaurea spp.), Dandelion (Taraxacum), Fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), <b>Marjoram</b> (Origanum vulgare), Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and Vetches (Vicia spp.).|$|E
25|$|The {{land was}} not {{suitable}} for large-scale grazing or extensive agriculture. Local grapes and wines were mentioned in inscriptions and on coins. But Pliny and other contemporary writers did not mention grapes and wines at the island. Most exports were via sea, and both necessities and luxuries had to imported, again by sea. Unlike in Athens, {{it is unclear whether}} Tenedos ever had a democracy. <b>Marjoram</b> (Oregano) from Tenedos was one of the relishes used in Greek cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was also}} flavored by plants, most {{native to the}} region and either {{cultivated}} or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic and onions, and possibly fenugreek, were used to season cooked foods, {{as well as being}} eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin and black cumin, dill, dwarf chicory, hyssop, <b>marjoram,</b> mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron and thyme. Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India, and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, <b>marjoram,</b> bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in <b>marjoram,</b> oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E
500|$|In Polish cuisine, white borscht ( [...] , {{also known}} as [...] or , 'sour soup') is made from a {{fermented}} mixture of rye flour or oatmeal and water. It is typically flavored with garlic and <b>marjoram,</b> and served over eggs and boiled fresh sausage; the water in which the sausage was boiled is often used instead of meat stock.|$|E
500|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell gives {{recipes for}} making fruit tarts using fruits {{as varied as}} apple, peach, cherry, damson, pear, and mulberry. For {{stuffing}} for meat and poultry, or as Dawson says [...] "to farse all things", he recommends using the herbs thyme, hyssop, and parsley, mixed with egg yolk, white bread, raisins or barberries, and spices including cloves, mace, cinnamon and ginger, {{all in the same}} dish. A sauce for pork was made with white wine, broth, nutmeg, and the herbs rosemary, bay, thyme, and <b>marjoram.</b>|$|E

The Japanese third-party manufacturer Hori also released Final Fantasy XII memory {{cards on the}} day of the game's release; stickers of Final Fantasy XII characters are included. Game peripheral maker Logicool (Logitech's Japanese branch) {{released a}} special edition Final Fantasy XII controller alongside the title on March 16. Suntory produced [...] "Final Fantasy XII Potion"—a drink containing such ingredients as royal jelly, chamomile, sage, thyme, and <b>marjoram.</b> The drinks became commercially available in Japan on March 7, 2006. Suntory also released a Final Fantasy XII Premium Box, which came with a Final Fantasy XII collector's card. The Potion was a limited edition product and is no longer available. Final Fantasy XII was also adapted into a manga by Gin Amou. Square Enix published the series in a total of five tankōbon volumes from December 22, 2006 to August 22, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, <b>marjoram,</b> marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E

2500|$|Yihye Bashiri (17th-century) {{described}} {{the manner in}} which the charoset was made in Yemen: [...] "They take figs or raisins or dates, and pound them into the consistency of dough. They then put vinegar thereto, and add spices. [...] Some there are who put ground sesame seeds into this admixture. On the night of the Passover, a person is required to put therein whole spices that have not been ground; either two or three seeds of valerian [...] (Arabic: sunbul), or sprigs of <b>marjoram</b> [...] (Arabic: za'tar), or savory [...] (Arabic: hasha), or things similar to them, so that it will resemble straw in mortar – in remembrance of that thing by which our fathers were enslaved in Egypt, seeing that it is like unto bricks and straw."
