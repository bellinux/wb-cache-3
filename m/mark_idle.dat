5000|$|The basic {{operation}} of IMTS was very advanced for its time, considering that integrated circuits were not commonly available. The most common IMTS phone, the Motorola TLD-1100 series, used two circuit boards about 8 inches square, {{to perform the}} channel scanning and digit decoding process, and all logic was performed with discrete transistors. In a given city, one IMTS base station channel was [...] "marked idle" [...] by the transmission of a steady 2000 Hz [...] "idle" [...] tone. Mobiles would scan the available frequencies and lock on to the channel transmitting the idle tone. When a call was placed to a mobile, the idle tone would change to 1800 Hz [...] "channel seize" [...] tone (the idle tone would appear on another frequency, if available), and the 7 digit mobile number (three digits of the NPA and the last four digits of subscriber number, the NXX was not sent) would be sent out as rotary dial pulses, switching between 2000 and 1800 Hz to represent digits. Any mobile recognizing that the call was for someone else would resume scanning for <b>mark</b> <b>idle</b> tone, while the called mobile would then transmit 2150 Hz [...] "guard" [...] tone back to the base station. This would also initiate ringing at the mobile, and when the mobile subscriber picked up the phone, 1633 Hz [...] "connect" [...] tone would {{be sent back to}} the base station to indicate answer supervision and the voice path would be cut through. When the mobile hung up, a burst of alternating 1336 [...] "disconnect" [...] and 1800 Hz [...] "seize" [...] tones would be sent to allow the base station to service another call.|$|E
50|$|At the {{terminating}} office, a Terminating Sender Link circuit connected a terminating sender to the trunk, {{in order}} to receive the phone number, typically using Revertive Pulse as in the panel switch to receive only the last four digits. Multi-frequency Terminating Senders were introduced in the 1950s as part of Direct Distance Dialing, and also used for incoming traffic from some local crossbar exchanges. The Terminating Sender activated an Incoming Marker, which then used a Number Group Circuit to find the line, <b>marked</b> an <b>idle</b> path, and operated the crossbar switches to use the links to connect the incoming trunk to the line.|$|R

In the meantime, I would {{recommend}} to thee a cautious tongue, for St. <b>Mark</b> makes no <b>idle</b> jokes {{with those who}} offend him. I am glad to see thee in this state of preparation, worthy padrone, and wishing thee a happy night, and a prosperous voyage, I commit thee to thy patron. But hold--ere I quit thee, I would know the hour that the land-breeze will serve?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Pythonesque is a Monty Python-related {{play by the}} British playwright Roy Smiles. It {{is based}} on Graham Chapman's battle with alcohol and his death from cancer. It {{continues}} with his rise in comedy and his getting the lead in Monty Python And The Holy Grail (1975) and Monty Python's Life Of Brian (1979). [...] It was first performed in South Africa in 2008 and made its British debut at the 2009 Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it starred Matt Addis as Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, James Lance as Terry Gilliam, Eric <b>Idle,</b> <b>Mark</b> Oosterveen as John Cleese, and Chris Polick as Graham Chapman.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{interviewees}} are Perry Botkin, Jr., Micky Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, <b>Mark</b> Hudson, Eric <b>Idle,</b> Ray Cooper, Al Kooper,Randy Newman, Yoko Ono, May Pang, Van Dyke Parks, Richard Perry, Jimmy Webb, Paul Williams, Robin Williams, Brian Wilson and The Smothers Brothers. Also included are interviews with Nilsson's wives and children. Discussing {{the film in}} 2011, Scheinfeld agreed {{that one of the}} most notable absences was any input from Ringo Starr. Explaining the latter's non-appearance, Scheinfeld said that Nilsson was among the three people that Starr finds it difficult to talk about, along with John Lennon and George Harrison. Another notable absence in the film is arranger-composer George Tipton, who worked closely with Nilsson on nearly all of his early RCA recordings; they reportedly had an unexplained and permanent falling-out, and Tipton refused to be interviewed for the film.|$|R
5000|$|With Modbus, BacNet and Profibus, A/B {{labeling}} refers A as {{the negative}} green wire and B as the positive red wire, {{in the definition}} of the D-sub connector and M12 circular connector, {{as can be seen in}} Profibus guides. As long as standard excludes logic function of the generator or receiver, it would make sense A (green, negative) is higher than B (red, positive). However this contradicts the facts that an <b>idle</b> <b>mark</b> state is a logical one and the termination polarization puts B at a higher voltage in Profibus guidelines. That so-called 'Pesky Polarity' problem [...] raised confusion which made authors think A is inverting within the TIA-485-A standard itself [...] and advise to swap what is A and B in drivers and line labeling as can be read in a section of an application bulletin: [...] "Design Consideration #3: Sometimes Bus Node A Isnâ€™t Really Bus Node A". It is now a common design decision to make this inversion which involves the following polarity chain: UART/MCU idle => TTL/CMOS = +5V => Line B voltage > Line A voltage, implying A, the green wire, is indeed connected to the driver inverting signal, as seen in a whitepaper.|$|R
60|$|But when I knelt with you, little urchin, upon my window-seat, {{it came to}} me as a thing almost intolerably {{desirable}} {{that some}} day you should become my real and understanding friend. I loved you profoundly. I wanted to stretch forward into time and speak to you, man myself to the man you are yet to be. It seemed to me that between us there must needs be peculiar subtleties of sympathy. And I remembered that by the time you were a man fully grown and emerging from the passionately tumultuous openings of manhood, capable of forgiving me all my blundering parentage, capable of perceiving all the justifying fine intention of my ill-conceived disciplines and misdirections, I might be either an old man, shriveling again to an inexplicable egotism, or dead. I saw myself as I had seen my father--first enfeebled and then inaccessibly tranquil. When presently you had gone from my study, I went to my writing-desk and drew a paper pad towards me, and sat thinking and making <b>idle</b> <b>marks</b> upon it with my pen. I wanted to exceed the limits of those frozen silences that must come at last between us, write a book that should lie in your world like a seed, and at last, as your own being ripened, flower into living understanding by your side.|$|R
50|$|The basic aim of LIVC is {{to reduce}} the intake pumping losses. These pumping losses are {{greatest}} at idle, progressively reducing as the manifold pressure (and the power output) increases. The test Suzuki engine consistently recorded a 40% improvement in economy at idle, when compared to the same engine with the standard camshaft fitted. This may seem a little unlikely, but it should be remembered that {{it has been estimated that}} at idle about 80% of the fuel used is just to overcome the intake pumping losses. Any reduction in pumping losses thus has a major and direct effect on the idle fuel use. As the power output rises, the 40% would quickly drop away but for an engine in typical road/traffic use an overall figure would be probably between 10% to 20% improvement. The surprising improvement in fuel economy at idle possibly only applies to carburetor engines like the Suzuki. Just how a modern multi-cylinder fuel injected car engine would behave with the Helical Camshaft is as yet untested. It seems likely that there would be a <b>marked</b> improvement in <b>idle</b> economy but maybe not 40% - at least not without other modifications. The Suzuki idled at about 55 or 60 extra degrees of late closing. That is; about 120 degrees after bottom dead centre. This means that the total duration required was around 320 degrees. Engine load control by LIVC needs very long durations. Usually a much longer duration is needed for load control by LIVC than would be needed for high RPM power, especially for a general-purpose road-going application. Importantly all this very long valve opening duration, when used for LIVC, must be at full valve lift. The valve lift must be at a maximum so as not to impede the flow into and out of the cylinder. Any restriction to the flow causes pumping losses which defeats the whole purpose of LIVC. Having discussed the use of the Helical Camshaft to aid high RPM power and also for load control by LIVC it should be made clear that there is no reason why both functions could not be used in the same engine. Realistically the Helical Camshaft principle can only be applied to twin cam engines. For maximising power output both the intake and exhaust cam would need to be of the Helical Camshaft type. The increase in duration needed for high RPM performance needs to be roughly equal on both the intake and exhaust cams, and roughly a symmetrical increase about the base duration lobe profile centre line. For LIVC operation alone, only the intake camshaft needs to be a Helical Camshaft. With a twin Helical Camshaft arrangement and suitable controls, an engine could have both extreme power output and also be very fuel efficient.|$|R
