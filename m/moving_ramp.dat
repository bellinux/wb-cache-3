5000|$|When the Bloor-Danforth {{line was}} opened in 1966 from Keele to Woodbine (TTC) station, the Bloor {{streetcar}} route was dramatically shortened. It now traveled east from Jane Loop {{only as far}} as Keele Station; at the eastern end of the line, a separate Danforth streetcar was established, from Woodbine station to Luttrell Loop.On 11 May 1968, the Bloor and Danforth streetcars were both eliminated when the subway extensions west to Islington and east to Warden were opened. During this initial two-year period the trolleybuses and streetcars serving the station used separate loops (both within the fare-paid area), one near each of the station's entrances, so that passengers transferring between streetcars and trolleybuses had to walk along the subway platform. While the main (Keele Street) entrance and trolleybus loop had escalators up to the platform, the east (parking lot and Indian Grove) entrance and streetcar loop were provided with a <b>moving</b> <b>ramp</b> leading up to what is now the eastbound subway platform. After streetcar service to the station ended in 1968, the streetcar loop property was redeveloped and the <b>moving</b> <b>ramp</b> was sealed off. [...] The former trolleybus loop is still used, by buses.|$|E
50|$|Almost all wheeled {{vehicles}} have a brake of some sort. Even baggage {{carts and}} shopping carts may have them {{for use on}} a <b>moving</b> <b>ramp.</b> Most fixed-wing aircraft are fitted with wheel brakes on the undercarriage. Some aircraft also feature air brakes designed to reduce their speed in flight. Notable examples include gliders and some World War II-era aircraft, primarily some fighter aircraft and many dive bombers of the era. These allow the aircraft to maintain a safe speed in a steep descent. The Saab B 17 dive bomber and Vought F4U Corsair fighter used the deployed undercarriage as an air brake.|$|E
50|$|Congestion at {{the lock}} {{was a serious}} problem before World War I, and a novel {{solution}} was employed to reduce it. A <b>moving</b> <b>ramp,</b> consisting of wooden slats with chocks to prevent rowing boats from rolling over, was constructed to bypass the lock. The ramp was similar to an escalator, and small boats simply rowed towards it, and were carried up to the higher level while the occupants remained seated in their boat. The boat lift opened in 1909, and was powered by an electric motor. The date of its demise is uncertain, but its location on Ray Mill island can still be visited.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how young children's increasingly flexible use of spatial reference frames enables accurate search for hidden objects {{by using a}} task that 3 -year-olds {{have been shown to}} perform with great accuracy and 2 -year-olds have been shown to perform inaccurately. Children watched as an object was rolled down a ramp, behind a panel of doors, and stopped at a barrier visible above the doors. In two experiments, we gave 2 - and 2. 5 -year-olds a strong reference frame by increasing the relative salience and stability of the barrier. In Experiment 1, 2. 5 -year-olds performed at above-chance levels with the more salient barrier. In Experiment 2, we highlighted the stability of the barrier (or ramp) by maximizing the spatial extent of each reference frame across the first four training trials. Children who were given a stable barrier (and <b>moving</b> <b>ramp)</b> during these initial trials performed at above-chance levels and significantly better than children who were given a stable ramp (and moving barrier). This work highlights that factors central to spatial cognition and motor planning-aligning egocentric and object-centered reference frames-play a role in the ramp task during this transitional phase in development...|$|E
40|$|In-fibre {{measurements}} of the Hugoniot {{have been carried out}} on a carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composite. For this material, we have shown at high shock stresses, a two component wave was formed consisting of a fast <b>moving</b> <b>ramped</b> portion and a slower moving shock wave. Changing the thickness of test specimen for a given shock stress resulted in a change in the magnitude and duration of the ramped portion of the wave front. As the shock stress imparted to the target was reduced, or the thickness of the target was increased, the steep shock wave in the rear surface gauge was no longer apparent. Instead a relatively slow rising wave was measured. Consequently, to establish a Hugoniot at lower shock stress levels, relatively thin specimens of target material are required...|$|R

40|$|A {{fractured}} eyering shaft (port) of {{the cargo}} door assembly of an aircraft {{was sent to the}} laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed that the shaft had fractured at the locking position resulting in dislodgement of the roller sub-assembly meant for <b>moving</b> the <b>ramp</b> on the track. The fracture surface was found to be extensively damaged and as a result, fractographic features on majority of the fracture surface were obliterated. However, in isolated places, the fracture surface was relatively preserved and examination of these regions showed presence of ductile dimple rupture, typical of overload failure. Because of post fracture damage, fractographic study alone was not adequate for establishing the failure mode. However, the fractographic study along with evidences available on the side track (port) suggests that the fracturing of the eyering shaft occurred most probably due to excessive load.

40|$|Numerous risks {{associated}} with transport and handling of livestock cause bruising and poor welfare to animals. Variables having an influence {{on the level of}} bruising under Namibian transport conditions include animal factors (breed type, age, sex, condition and subcutaneous fat cover), pre-transport handling (re-branding of animals), transport related risks (loading density, animals lying down during transit) and lairage factors (fit of truck floor to off-loading <b>ramp,</b> <b>moving</b> to holding pen, pen size and minimum temperatures). Although no single factor was the dominant driver of bruise prevalence; load density, gravel roads, and cattle running after disembarking had a cumulative effect on bruising. Surprisingly, transport duration (3 vs 8. h) had minimal effect. The overall incidence of bruising is high, with the highest levels on the hips, around the butt and pin areas.

50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is largely}} {{the same as}} the first two in the series. Much like the classic arcade game Marble Madness, the player must navigate a ball across many puzzling courses within a time limit, usually 60 seconds. The controls are very simple: the player uses the directional analog stick to move the entire floor in order to guide one of four anthropomorphic monkeys (encased in a large clear ball) towards the goal, while avoiding hazards and obstacles (for example, <b>moving</b> platforms, mazes, <b>ramps).</b> Collecting bananas scattered throughout the stage raises the player's score, and awards extra lives. If the monkey ball falls off the edge of a platform or the time runs out, the stage ends and the player loses a life. If the player reaches the arch-shaped goal, the player advances to the next stage. Higher levels have a greater challenge and complexity: most of the levels in Story Mode are characterised as Beginner, Advanced and Expert.|$|R

50|$|As {{the ramp}} nears completion, Eleazar faces {{the fact that}} the final {{confrontation}} with the Romans is not far off. The Zealots break into Herod’s Armory and begin to prepare for what they believe will be a straightforward storming of the fortress walls by the Romans. When the ramp is complete, the Romans wheel out the armoured siege tower and battering-ram. Eleazar then realizes that he had underestimated Silva’s strategy. As the tower begins <b>moving</b> up the <b>ramp,</b> Eleazar has his people build “an inner wall that will absorb the blows of the ram and not shatter.” Made from wooden beams from Herod’s Palace roof and packed with dirt, they finish it just as the tower reaches the top of the ramp. The Romans quickly break through the stone walls of the fortress, but the ram does nothing against the improvised inner wall. As the wall is made partly of wood, Silva orders his men to set fire to it.

40|$|The Campina Grande and Serra Redonda Granites are {{intrusive}} {{along the}} contact of the Paleoproterozoic basement(Alto Moxotó Domain) with the Tonian gneisses (Alto Pajeú Domain) of the Borborema Province (northeast Brazil). TheCampina Grande Granite (U-Pb age = 581 ± 2 Ma) shows a concentric oval-shaped structure whereas the Serra RedondaGranite (U-Pb age = 576 ± 3 Ma) has a tabular shape, elongated in the NE-SW direction. The plutons are separated bythe left-lateral Galante transcurrent shear zone. In this study, the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was appliedto 64 outcrops of granites {{to determine the}} internal structures of these plutons and to explore the relationship betweenmagmatism and deformation in an orogenic setting. The magnetic fabrics are concordant with the metamorphic structure ofthe host rocks. Strike-slip shear zones controlled the emplacement of the Serra Redonda Granite, as indicated by sigmoidalfoliation, defining shear bands associated with the Galante shear zone. In contrast, the magmatic/magnetic fabric of theCampina Grande granite {{seems to have been}} produced by body (ascensional) forces. The pluton displays an inward dipping, concentric planar fabric parallel to the wall rock contact and lineations highly oblique to the foliation trend. The fabric of the Campina Grande pluton is consistent with a magma <b>moving</b> over a <b>ramp</b> dipping to southwest, with the lineation at high angle to the NE-trending flow direction. The contrasting structures of the plutons reflect the episodic nature of orogenic deformation, which was punctuated by the alternation of weak and strong strains, affecting the fabric development of the syntectonic intrusions...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{report the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of a journal bearing, specifically, a cylinder suspended in a viscous fluid housed within a cylindrical shell, rolling down an incline under the influence of gravity. Particular attention is given to rationalizing the distinct modes of motion observed. We performed a series of experiments in which the inner cylinder density and the fluid viscosity were varied. Three distinct types of behavior were observed. First, in what we shall call the "rocking" mode, after an initial settling period, the shell rocks back and forth without <b>moving</b> down the <b>ramp.</b> Second, we observed "slow, quasi-steady rolling"; this mode is characterized by the system proceeding down the hill at essentially a constant velocity. Finally, the cylinders roll down the incline with constant acceleration; we shall call this mode "unbounded acceleration. " An accompanying theoretical model is developed and enables us to rationalize the rocking and accelerating modes. In the rocking solutions, potential and kinetic energy are dissipated in the fluid as the inner cylinder approaches the bottom of the outer cylinder. (cont.) In the accelerating solutions, the whole system moves as a solid body so that no dissipation occurs and potential energy is continually converted into kinetic energy. In order to understand the quasi-steady motion, we analyze the motion of a similar system: a metal cylinder is placed inside a larger plastic cylinder filled with fluid and attached to a motor which fixes the larger cylinder's rotation rate. Our observations of this system, specifically, the differences between experiments and theory lead us to consider the effect of internal friction due to surface roughness. The resulting model's predictions are well supported by our observations. Finally, to rationalize the slow, quasi-steady rolling motion of the system, we incorporate surface roughness and cavitation into the theoretical model. These effects provide a restoring force on the inner cylinder; however, we find that surface roughness is the dominant effect. by David Paul Vener. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study into the behaviour of sheep with {{particular emphasis on}} sheep movement and behaviour in narrow lane-ways. It is divided into five sections. The first section consists of {{a review of the}} behavioural implications associated with domestication. This review topic gives the reader a brief synopsis of previous work and conjecture on the behavioural and physiological responses of sheep. Although this review is only indirectly related to the experimental work it does emphasise the importance and relevance of behavioural studies to the agricultural industry. The second section describes an experiment aimed at investigating some of the factors which affect movement of sheep through races and to provide information required for the design of future work. The movement of flocks of sheep through races (narrow lane-ways) was observed and the effect of (1) forced or voluntary movement (2) whether the sides were open, partially covered or totally covered and (3) flock size, were examined. Differences in the movement of individual sheep were also investigated. Flock size (10 or 20) had very little effect on the movement of sheep in races. When sheep were forced through the race they ran faster, were more bunched and held their heads higher than when moving voluntarily. The race type effect on sheep movement was greatest when sheep were moving voluntarily. This suggests that forcing sheep masked the race type effect. A relatively consistent order of sheep through the race suggests that sheep maintain similar positions when running through races. This effect was reduced when the sheep were forced. Sheep moved faster through open or partially covered races than through totally covered races. They were also more bunched and held their heads higher as the race was increasingly covered. The remaining sections discuss experiments concerned with the evaluation of the current folklore or principles of sheep handling and behaviour. The third section discusses the movement of sheep around corners. The movement of flocks of 20 sheep through races (narrow laneways) incorporating an angle was observed, and the effect of (1) width of race, (2) whether the sides were open or covered and (3) the angle of corner, were examined. Sheep ran faster through races 1. 5 m. wide than through races 0. 5 m. wide, because they could move as a group rather than being constrained to move in single file. In both narrow and wide races sheep ran faster and were more spread out when the sides were covered, than when the sides were open. Corners acted as an impediment to sheep flow because the spacing between sheep decreased before the corner and increased after it. In wide races the time taken to run through the race increased as the angle of the corner increased. However, in narrow races the corner appeared to have an overall acclerating effect, despite the increased spacing between sheep. The findings in section three have been accepted for publication by the Journal of Applied Animal Ethology. The fourth section discusses the movement of sheep up or down inclines. The movement of flocks of 15 sheep through narrow ramps and of 14 sheep through wide ramps was observed and the effect of (1) movement up or down the ramp (2) whether the floor type was slats, a solid surface or steps and (3) the angle of incline, were examined. In both narrow and wide ramps sheep ran faster and were more bunched when <b>moving</b> up the <b>ramp,</b> than when <b>moving</b> down the <b>ramp.</b> Steep slopes acted as an impediment to sheep flow, slowing the rate of movement of the flock and increasing the spacing between sheep {{at the end of the}} ramp. Floor type had no effect on sheep movement in the narrow ramp. In the wide ramp, the solid floor increased the sheep's rate of movement going up the ramp, but decreased it when sheep were descending the ramp. The fifth section discusses the movement of sheep through or into differing light intensities. The movement of flocks of 14 sheep through narrow and wide races (narrow laneways) was observed. A partition across the race allowed the light intensity to be varied independently on each side and the effects of four levels of light intensity i. e. 1. 4, 88, 350, and 1, 400 lux (dark, low, medium and bright respectively) were examined. The effect of different light intensity on the movement of sheep was not great. There was little evidence to suggest that contrast was important. The results suggest that sheep move more readily through or into brightly lit areas, but that this response is clearly dependent upon the first sheep's behaviour. From the results of these trials, revised "principles" of sheep behaviour have been obtained which have important implications for the design of yards, sheds and races.
