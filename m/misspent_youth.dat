25|$|In fiction, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} amount of work being done on possibilities of rejuvenation treatments, and the effect this would have on society. <b>Misspent</b> <b>Youth</b> {{as well as the}} Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton {{are one of the most}} well known examples of this, dealing with the short- and long-term effects of a near perfect 80-year-old to 20-year-old body change with mind intact. Also the Mars trilogy deals with a much more imperfect type of rejuvenation, including problems such as long-term memory loss and sheer boredom that comes with such age. Also the post-mortal characters in the Revelation Space series often illustrate this issue with long-term or essentially infinite lifespans, sheer boredom induces them to undertake activities of extreme risk.|$|E

50|$|Amata of Assisi was a Poor Clare. After a <b>youth</b> <b>misspent,</b> Amata {{became very}} ill and was healed by her aunt, St. Clare. With this miracle {{she changed her}} life and entered the Poor Clares, later {{becoming}} an aquintance of St. Dominic.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dramatic}} performer {{must take}} {{on the character of}} Desirée: a woman who finally realizes that she has <b>misspent</b> her <b>youth</b> on the shallow life. She is both angry and sad, and both must be seen in the performance. Two important examples are the contrast between the lines, [...] "Quick, send in the clowns" [...] and [...] "Well, maybe next year." [...] Sondheim teaches that the former should be steeped in self-loathing, while the latter should emphasize regret. Thus, the former is clipped, with a break between [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "send," [...] while the latter [...] "well" [...] is held pensively.|$|R
500|$|At first, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a [...] "quintessentially American person" [...] {{to play the role of}} House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a <b>misspent</b> <b>youth</b> [...] too much TV and too many movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E
2500|$|Rolfe {{was entirely}} {{comfortable}} with his homosexuality and associated and corresponded {{with a number}} of other gay Englishmen. Early in his life he wrote a fair amount of idealistic but mawkish poetry about boy martyrs and the like. These and his Toto stories contain pederastic elements, but the young male pupils he was teaching at the time unanimously recalled in later life that there had never been any hint of impropriety in his relations with them. As he himself matured, Rolfe's settled sexual preference was for late adolescents. Towards {{the end of his life}} he made his only explicit reference to his specific sexual age preference, in one of the Venice letters to Charles Masson Fox, in which he declared: [...] "My preference was for the 16, 17, 18 and large." [...] Grant Richards, in his Memories of a <b>Misspent</b> <b>Youth</b> (1932), recalls [...] "Frederick Baron Corvo" [...] at Parson's Pleasure in Oxford – where scholars could bathe naked – [...] "surveying the yellow flesh tints of youth with unbecoming satisfaction".|$|E

6000|$|So {{deemed the}} Childe, as o'er the {{mountains}} he [...] Did take {{his way in}} solitary guise: [...] Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee, [...] More restless than the swallow in the skies: [...] Though here awhile he learned to moralise, [...] For Meditation fixed at times on him, [...] And conscious Reason whispered to despise [...] His early <b>youth</b> <b>misspent</b> in maddest whim; But as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{nobody ever}} said it of you, my boy," [...] Mr. Poyntz remarked, and Foker {{striking}} spurs into his pony, cantered away down Rotten Row, his mind agitated with various emotions, ambitions, mortifications. He was sorry {{that he had}} not been good at his books in early life--that he might have cut out all those chaps who were about her, and who talked the languages, and wrote poetry, and painted pictures in her album, and--and that--"What am I," [...] thought little Foker, [...] "compared to her? She's all soul, she is, and can write poetry or compose music, as easy as I could drink a glass of beer. Beer?--damme, that's all I'm fit for, is beer. I am a poor, ignorant little beggar, good for nothing but Foker's Entire. I <b>misspent</b> my <b>youth,</b> and used to get the chaps to do my exercises. And what's the consequences now? Oh, Harry Foker, what a confounded little fool you have been!" ...|$|R
50|$|The dining room, {{several days}} later. It is late at night. Before going to bed, Serebryakov {{complains}} {{of being in}} pain and of old age. Astrov arrives, having been sent for by Sonya, but the professor refuses to see him. After Serebryakov is asleep, Yelena and Vanya talk. She speaks of the discord in the house, and Vanya speaks of dashed hopes. He feels he’s <b>misspent</b> his <b>youth,</b> and he associates his unrequited love for Yelena with the devastation of his life. Yelena refuses to listen. Alone, Vanya questions why he did not {{fall in love with}} Yelena when he first met her ten years before, when it would have been possible for the two to have married and had a happy life together. At that time, Vanya believed in Serebryakov’s greatness and was happy to think that his own efforts supported Serebryakov's work; now he has become disillusioned with the professor and his life feels empty. As Vanya agonizes over his past, Astrov returns, somewhat drunk, and the two talk together. Sonya chides Vanya for his drinking, and responds pragmatically to his reflections on the futility of a wasted life, pointing out that only work is truly fulfilling.|$|R
60|$|Pen promised and wondered, and the Major's door {{having been}} closed upon him by Morgan, Foker took Pen's arm, and walked {{with him for}} some time silently puffing his cigar. At last, when they had reached Charing Cross on Arthur's way home to the Temple, Harry Foker {{relieved}} himself, and broke out with that eulogium upon poetry, and those regrets regarding a <b>misspent</b> <b>youth</b> which have just been mentioned. And all the way along the Strand, {{and up to the}} door of Pen's very staircase, in Lamb Court, Temple, young Harry Foker did not cease to speak about singing and Blanche Amory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Misspent</b> <b>Youth</b> {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{universe}} as Hamilton's later Commonwealth Saga, consisting of Pandora's Star (2004) and Judas Unchained (2005).
