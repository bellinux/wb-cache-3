500|$|The {{relationship}} between Grimaldi {{and his son}} first became strained during the early 1820s. JS, who had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>of</b> emulating his father's act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. [...] He became resentful {{of his father and}} publicly shunned any association with him. [...] JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. [...] In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS {{went out of his way}} to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money. JS once replied: [...] "At present I am in difficulties; but as long as I have a shilling you shall have half". [...] However, there is no record of him ever sending money to his father. JS finally returned home in 1827, when the Grimaldis were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{influential}} African American {{of the nineteenth}} century, Douglass <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>of</b> agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote {{on behalf of a}} variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: [...] "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Music author Reebee Garofalo {{argued that}} Biafra and Alternative Tentacles {{may have been}} {{targeted}} because the label was a [...] "small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle." [...] Facing the possible sentence of {{a year in jail}} and a $2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>of</b> his spoken word performances.|$|E
2500|$|Grimaldi <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>of</b> emulating his father's act and {{received}} favourable notices as a clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed {{by that of}} his father's. As his career blossomed, he was increasingly and unfavourably compared with his more famous father in terms of personality and acting ability. [...] The comparisons affected his self-confidence. Grimaldi's desire to distance himself professionally from his famous father had intensified during their constant touring of the provincial theatres together. [...] Grimaldi heard of an outrage committed in 1820 by the actor Robert Bradbury, who assaulted a heckler in his audience. [...] Bradbury gained a rebellious reputation because of it; something which appealed greatly to Grimaldi, as {{it was an act}} so far removed from his father's gentle reputation. During the 1821 pantomime Harlequin and Mother Bunch, Grimaldi caused a scandal and was censured for threatening and verbally abusing an audience member who criticised his performance.|$|E
