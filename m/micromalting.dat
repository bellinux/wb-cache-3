40|$|Factors {{that affect}} wort {{fermentability}} were investigated with 180 doubled haploid lines from an Arapiles/Franklin cross. Barley, grown in South Australia during 2001, was <b>micromalted</b> and analysed using standard methods. Samples {{were found to}} have a wide range in malting quality with lines both superior and inferior to the parents for all traits analysed. QTL and statistical analysis of data indicated, for this population, that poor malt modification, beta-glucan in particular, had the greatest negative effect on fermentability. Fermentability was also negatively correlated with the maltotetrose content of wort. A significant QTL for this sugar was coincident with the chromosome 4 H locus for the heat-stable beta-amylase (sd 2 H). Lines with the heat stable enzyme, inherited from Arapiles, had improved fermentabilities of IOB extracts but not of EBC extracts. Glucose, possibly coming from beta-glucan hydrolysis, was found to {{have a positive effect on}} fermentability.

40|$|In this study, {{more than}} 1, 000 {{commercial}} malting samples from Australia and elsewhere, primarily malted in 2005 and 2006, were analyzed for {{their levels of}} the diastatic power (DP) enzymes alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, and limit dextrinase. The survey showed {{that there was more}} variation within a variety for DP and DP enzymes than between varieties. The data were evaluated, and a <b>micromalting</b> experiment was conducted to ascertain whether the wide range of malt qualities observed was the result of customer specifications, environmental conditions under which the barley was grown, variety, or malting practices. The evaluation of malt used by two breweries {{over the course of a}} year suggested that the conventional brewery customer specifications for variety, Kolbach index, and DP are somewhat successful in constraining potential fermentability variation. The conditions under which barley for malting was grown were also plausible factors that could explain the observed differences in DP enzyme levels. However, <b>micromalting</b> barley sourced from different regions showed that malting conditions had a strong influence on the malt levels of alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase. When combined, the observations and conclusions of this study further support our previous recommendations that the routine measurement of individual DP enzymes would most likely improve the consistency and predictability of the potential fermentability of malts supplied to brewers.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the levels of the diastatic power enzymes (DPEs) beta-amylase, limit dextrinase, and alpha-amylase has previously been shown to predict barley malt fermentability. Using <b>micromalted</b> samples of barley from different genotypes and growing environments, it was demonstrated that both these factors were important in determining the level of DPEs in malt. In terms of genotypic effects, a trial of breeders’ lines and varieties showed substantial variation in the levels of total beta-amylase (means 455 – 914 U/g), total limit dextrinase (means 268 – 603 U/kg), and alpha-amylase (means 154 – 316 U/g). The application of gibberellin (GA) during malting resulted in substantial increases in the levels of total limit dextrinase and alpha-amylase {{and the extent of}} modification (KI). However, the level of total beta-amylase was relatively unchanged. It was also observed that the levels of total limit dextrinase and alpha-amylase and extent of KI generally were highly correlated (r » 0. 6 – 0. 7), which was attributed to the sensitivity of each of these malt quality factors to GA. The results are discussed in terms of their practical importance to barley breeders and maltsters seeking to supply malt that satisfies the malt fermentability requirements of their brewing customers.

The potential to improve malting quality of hulless barley was investigated with a two-row doubled haploid population (TR 251 /HB 345). TR 251 is a covered, malt breeding line with good malting potential while HB 345 is a hulless line with good agronomic traits and the gene for heat stable -amylase (sd 2 H). Barley grown in standard yield test plots at Brandon, Manitoba during 2002 was <b>micromalted</b> and analysed using standard conditions. The 62 hulless lines, on average, had {{significantly higher levels of}} malt extract than the 62 covered lines. A significantly lower percentage of the hulless extract was fermentable but the hulless lines still fermented a greater amount of total extract. Levels of diastatic power were similar among hulless and covered malts but -amylase was significantly lower in the hulless lines. Heat stable -amylase improved fermentability but not significantly. Samples showed an acceptable degree of malt modification but -glucan levels still had a negative effect on fermentability. Levels of total free amino acids were similar among hulless and covered worts; however, levels of several individual amino acids were significantly lower in the hulless worts which had a negative effect on fermentability. In summary, hulless malt had some superior attributes compared to covered malt but increased levels of some specific enzymes would further enhance its appeal. M. J. Edney, W. G. Legge, B. G.

40|$|Based {{on prior}} {{research}} that showed significant genetic differences be- tween barley genotypes for beer sensor y descriptors, {{the effects of}} degree of malt modification on these descriptors were assessed in two experi- ments. The first experiment involved sensory assessment of nano-beers made from <b>micromalts</b> of Golden Promise, Full Pint, 34 doubled haploid progeny, and the check CDC Copeland. Average degree of modification was assessed by sampling grain {{from each of the}} 37 genotypes stored for three postharvest intervals prior to malting and brewing. The second ex- periment involved sensory assessment of pilot beers made from intention- ally under-, properly, and overmodified pilot malts of two barley varieties: Full Pint and CDC Copeland. In both experiments, genotypes were the principal sources of significant variati on in sensory descriptors. Degree of modification and genotype × modificati on interactions were also signifi- cant for some descriptors. Based on the results of this study, the genetic characterization of and selection for ba rley contributions to beer flavor are warranted, even with undermodified malts. The contribution of barley variety to beer flavor will likely be modest compared with the flavors developed during the malting process and the flavors contributed by hops and yeast. However, in certain beer styles, the contributions of barley genotype may be worth the attention of maltsters, brewers, and consumers.

Kiln drying according to a commercial schedule reduced the number of all types of microflora below the number present before kilning, but all were present in larger numbers in the kilned malt than in the original grain. In barley stored at room temperature and at a moisture content of 15 to 18 %, members of the Aspergillus glaucus group increased with increasing time and increasing moisture content, and germination percentage of the seeds decreased.

40|$|Germination of {{monocotyledonous}} plants involves activation and de novo {{synthesis of}} enzymes that degrade cell walls and starch and mobilize stored endosperm reserves for embryo growth. Two-dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were applied to identify major water-soluble proteins in extracts of mature barley (Hordeum vulgare) seeds and to follow their fate during germination. About 1200 and 600 spots of pI 4 - 7 were detected on 2 -D gels by silver staining and colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, respectively. About 300 spots were selected for in-gel digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry-peptide map fingerprint analysis. Database searches using measured peptide masses resulted in 198 identifications of 103 proteins in 177 spots. These include housekeeping enzymes, chaperones, defence proteins (including enzyme inhibitors), and proteins related to desiccation and oxidative stress. Sixty-four of the identifications were made using expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Numerous spots in the 2 -D gel pattern changed during germination (<b>micromalting)</b> and an intensely stained area which contained large amounts of the serpin protein Z appeared centrally on the 2 -D gel. Spots containing alpha-amylase also appeared.

40|$|This {{research}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that barley genotype can affect beer flavor and assessed the relative contributions of genotype and location to beer sensory descriptors. Golden Promise, Full Pint, 34 of their doubled haploid progeny, and CDC Copeland were grown at three locations in Oregon, U. S. A. Grain from these trials was micromalted and the resulting malts used for nano-brewing. Sensory evaluations were conducted on the nano-brews. Barley genotype had significant effects on many sensory descriptors. The most significant sensory descriptors—when comparing barley genotypes—were cereal, color, floral, fruity, grassy, honey, malty, toasted, toffee, and sweet. Golden Promise was significantly higher in fruity, floral, and grassy flavors, whereas Full Pint was significantly higher in malty, toffee, and toasted flavors. CDC Copeland was closest to neutral for most flavor traits. There were notable differences for some descriptors between locations. New combinations of parental flavor attributes were observed in the progeny. Multitrait analysis revealed regions of the barley genome with significant effects on malting quality and flavor traits. These findings are, of course, applicable only to the barley germplasm tested, the environment sampled, and the protocols used for <b>micromalting</b> and brewing.

40|$|AbstractFusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) caused by Fusarium and Microdochium species can {{significantly}} affect the yield of barley grain {{as well as}} the quality and safety of malt and beer. The present study provides new knowledge on the impacts of the FHB pathogen complex on the malting and brewing quality parameters of naturally infected barley. Quantitative real-time PCR and liquid chromatography double mass spectrometry were used to quantify the predominant FHB pathogens and Fusarium mycotoxins, respectively, in commercially grown UK malting barley samples collected between 2007 and 2011. The predominant Fusarium species identified across the years were F. poae, F. tricinctum and F. avenaceum. Microdochium majus was the predominant Microdochium species in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 whilst Microdochium nivale predominated in 2009. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone quantified in samples collected between 2007 and 2009 were associated with F. graminearum and F. culmorum, whilst HT- 2 and T- 2, and nivalenol in samples collected between 2010 and 2011 correlated positively with F. langsethiae and F. poae, respectively. Analysis of the regional distribution and yearly variation in samples from 2010 to 2011 showed significant differences in the composition of the FHB species complex. In most regions (Scotland, the South and North of England) the harvest in 2010 had higher concentrations of Fusarium spp. than in 2011, although no significant difference was observed in the Midlands between the two years. Microdochium DNA was significantly higher in 2011 and in the North of England and Scotland compared to the South or Midlands regions. Pathogens of the FHB complex impacted negatively on grain yield and quality parameters. Thousand grain weight of malting barley was affected significantly by M. nivale and M. majus whilst specific weight correlated negatively with F. avenaceum and F. graminearum. To determine the impact of sub-acute infections of the identified Fusarium and Microdochium species on malting and brewing quality of naturally infected samples, selected malting barley cultivars (Optic, Quench and Tipple) were <b>micromalted</b> and subjected to malt and wort analysis of key quality parameters. F. poae and M. nivale decreased germinative energy and increased water sensitivity of barley. The fungal biomass of F. poae and F. langsethiae correlated with increased wort free amino nitrogen and with decreased extract of malt. DNA of M. nivale correlated with increased malt friability as well as decreased wort filtration volume. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the impact of species such as the newly emerging F. langsethiae, as well as F. poae and the two non-toxigenic Microdochium species should be considered when evaluating the quality of malting barley...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} liquid chromatography, {{using either}} reverse phase, anion exchange or chromatofocus mg columns {{was used for}} the resolution of hordems extracted from Irish barley varieties. The possibility of using the hordein elution profiles for the routine identification of Irish barley varieties was investigated. Extracted hordems were well resolved with the two reverse phase columns used in the present work and the difference between the elution profiles of the thirteen varieties examined were very obvious. It was possible to reduce hordein elution times for the reported 110 minutes to about 50 minutes without loss in resolution by using a C 4 rather than C 18 column. As the hordein profiles were repeatable even after extended column use, they can be used for the positive identification of Irish barley varieties. Hordein elution profiles characteristics of a particular variety were also obtained with anion exchange column and chromatofocusing, but the resolution with both was much poorer than with reverse phase columns. The repeatability of hordein profiles with anion exchange columns was poor, resolution deteriorated rapidly after five injections and elaborate column cleaning was required to restore it Repeatability was somewhat better with chromatofocusing but also a lengthy column cleaning was required after every ten injections. For both columns hordein profiles obtained before and after column cleaning were different, hence the techniques in their present form cannot be used for varietal identification. The two most commonly used methods for the determination of 6 -glucan levels namely the cellulase and the lichenase assay were evaluated. Considerably higher total 13 -glucan levels were obtained with the cellulase than with the lichenase assay but {{it was not possible to}} establish from the available data which was the more accurate method However, as the lichenase assay is the preferred method of the brewing industry it was used for estimating the effect of variety, agronomy and environmental factors on 6 -glucan levels in barely Varietal effect on 8 -glucan levels was evident, intervarietal differences were statistically significant and even if 8 -glucan levels for all varieties changed with season, the order of values remained constant. Autumn sowing dates had no effect on B-glucan levels at two locations and the effect of applied nitrogen at three locations was inconclusive. A strong environmental effect on 8 -glucan levels was also noted, in that levels seem to be effected by soil moisture during gram filling and decline with decreasing soil moisture. Barley samples used for the determination of external effects on B-glucan levels were <b>micromalted</b> to evaluate external effects on B-glucanase levels in malt.

The other two methods were viscometry and radial diffusion assay. There was a definite varietal effect on B-glucanase as the differences between levels corresponding to the six varieties were statistically significant and the order of values remained constant for two seasons.

40|$|Malted barley is an {{important}} ingredient used in the brewing and distilling industry worldwide. In this study, we used a proteomics approach to investigate the biochemical function of previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on barley chromosomes 1 H and 4 H that influence malting quality. Using a subset of barley introgression lines containing wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) alleles at these QTLs, we validated that wild barley alleles at the chromosome 1 H QTL reduced overall malting quality, whereas wild barley alleles at the chromosome 4 H QTL improved the malting quality parameters α-amylase activity, VZ 45, and Kolbach index compared to the control genotype Scarlett. 2 DE was used to detect changes in protein expression during the first 72 h of <b>micromalting</b> associated with these QTLs. In total, 16 protein spots showed {{a significant change in}} expression between the introgression lines and Scarlett, of which 14 were successfully identified with MS.

40|$|Published {{version is}} a large file {{containing}} all poster presentations. During malting, barley grains are steeped in water and then allowed to germinate under controlled conditions. This process is generically termed modification. The overall degree and relative proportion of starch, protein and cell wall modification during malting are critical in determining {{the quality of the}} final product. The modification process is greatly influenced by both the variety investigated and the environment in which the variety is grown. Currently, there are a large number of high malting quality varieties being grown worldwide that differ dramatically {{in the way in which}} they modify. These varieties are adapted to vastly different growing environments and often perform poorly when removed from their ideal environment. In this study, twelve international malting varieties were grown in Scotland, Canada and Australia in 2002 and 2003, in order to compare their modification profiles. They were malted in a Phoenix micromalter using a standard <b>micromalting</b> regime from each country. These regimes varied greatly, with large differences in both the number and length of steeps and the length of time for germination. Both the country and micromalter schedule had large effects on the degree of modification of the grain. The implications of these results will be discussed. H. M. Collins, J. S. Swanston, B. G.

40|$|In the {{development}} of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars for malting purposes, it is usually not possible to select for malt quality characteristics in early generations {{because of the high}} cost associated with <b>micromalting</b> large numbers of grain samples and assessing quality traits on the resulting malt samples and because of the sensitivity of quantitative malt quality traits to environmental variation. Thus, barley malting quality may be a good candidate for marker-assisted selection. Here, the objective was to use marker-based selection to manipulate a malt quality characteristic, -amylase activity, in a barley breeding population. Marker-based selection was applied among F₂:₃ lines from the cross ‘Morex’/‘Labelle’, targeting Morex alleles in a region of chromosome 7 (5 H) that had previously been found to affect -amylase activity in the cross ‘Steptoe’/Morex. The target region was represented by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. Selected lines were grown in field plots in two years. Agronomic and grain quality data were measured. Grain samples were micromalted and assessed for malt quality traits. Selection for the Morex allele at two PCR markers on chromosome 7 (5 H) was effective in increasing -amylase activity. It was concluded that marker-based selection for a quantitative trait locus could be effective even when applied in a population other than the mapping population.

40|$|Standard {{analysis}} of malt flour can mask {{the heterogeneity of}} hydrolytic enzyme activity. Kernel heterogeneity can lead to brewhouse problems and a product with unpredictable nitrogen and fermentable sugar content. The variability between individual grains of important malting characteristics was measured in malt samples produced under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Various parameters (including germinative energy, germinative capacity, moisture content, β-glucanase activity, friability and homogeneity) were measured {{to ensure that the}} 5 d aerobic Optic malt, produced in Heriot-Watt university micromaltings, was viable and of commercial quality. The 5 d aerobic malt kernels produced at Simpsons Maltings in Berwick-Upon- Tweed were heavier than the micromalt. Commercially produced malt kernels had higher levels of fermentable sugars and soluble nitrogen than the micromalt despite lower α-amylase, β-amylase and ‘total’ limit dextrinase activity. Differences between the 5 d aerobic micromalt and the 5 d aerobic commercially produced malt are indicative of why <b>micromalting</b> cannot always be used as a model system for what is happening industrially and must be modelled on commercial practice. Subjecting 5 d aerobic micromalt to 24 h anaerobic incubation resulted in increased levels of fermentable sugars per l wort. 24 h anoxia also resulted in increased α-amylase and limit dextrinase activities. There are potential industrial applications for this anaerobic wort.

On a <b>micromalting</b> equipment malts were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with decoction process (mashing program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, FAN, colour, bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a final attenuation of 61. 5 % and 73. 2 %. In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC.
