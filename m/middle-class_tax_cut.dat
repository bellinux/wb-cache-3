Clinton's requested budget provided a <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> including new deductions for children and college expenses, which was offset by a twice-as-large reduction in spending elsewhere in the budget, echoing Speaker Gingrich's goal to eliminate programs that had outlived their usefulness. However, Republicans had demanded a budget that would lead to a balanced budget in 2002, but Clinton's budget projected annual deficits of around $190 billion up to 2005. Clinton's plan also proposed to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, and reorganize the Departments of Energy, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development by consolidating programs into fewer, larger ones, as well as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration by cutting their staff by a third and a half, respectively.|$|E

Cashconstrained firms increase investment after the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> relative to cash-rich firms. Reallocation is stronger among closely held firms that experience a larger <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> This result is explained by higher nominal equity in cash-constrained firms and by higher dividends in cash-rich firms after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The heterogeneous investment responses imply that the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> raises efficiency by improving allocation of investment...|$|R
