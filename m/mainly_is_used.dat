Whereas in conventional welding techniques process gas <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> as shielding gas, for preventing the weld bead from oxidation, in laser beam welding process gas in addition is needed for control of the laser induced plasma. For that purpose inert gas helium is the most efficient but most expensive one. The use of other process gases than helium in laser beam welding can produce plasma shieling and in consequence process interruption caused by fluctuations in process or production parameters. This paper presents a method of control called PSC (plasma shielding control) that avoids the formation of strong plasma shielding. In aluminium welding PSC opens a range of process gas application with improvement of process efficiency and weld seam quality. In welding steel PSC is able to reduce gas costs...|$|E
40|$|Although (the {{relevance}} of) stakeholder management receives {{considerable attention}} in literature, {{the problem of}} actual stakeholder identification is yet unresolved. This article analyses the potential contributions of critical systems thinking to solving this problem. Especially Ulrich's notion of boundary critique, by which he focuses on stakeholder roles and particularly the role of 'the affected', seems a fruitful contribution. By adapting the role definitions towards a project context, including project dynamics, and adding operating instructions, a method has been developed {{that can be used}} for actual stakeholder identification in organizational projects. This method is demonstrated on two projects. The results show that this adapted version of boundary critique, which in its original form <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in the context of civil society, is also relevant in an organizational profit-based context.

Through {{woodworking}} four-side planer vibration test, {{this article}} studies its dynamic characteristics and dynamic response {{to identify the}} vibration magnitudes law of each feed roll shafts of the four-side feed beam; then finds the natural frequency and damping ratio of the feed beam and lathe bed; obtains the mathematical model of feed roll shaft vibration magnitude changing with the feed rate U under different process thicknesses. The analysis of feeding quantity and the rationality of lathe bed {{from the perspective of}} vibration design supplies the designs and operation staff with reference data. Overview Woodworking four-side planer is the lathe bed that processes the four sides of wood simultaneously, it can process the molding surface of various shapes, <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to process plate, square timber into four planes or molding surfaces vertically. Processed wood products can obtain their exact sizes, cross-sectional shapes and surface finish, and the machine is a typical process centralized multi-joint lathe. It increases the processing capacity and production efficiency, is a widely applied finishing machine in the wood processing industry.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the strategies of formal customer evaluations and the use of satisfied customer index in the Swedish commercial real estate industry. Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on an inventory of 24 commercial real estate companies use of formal customer evaluations and an analysis of 15 interviews with top-level managers in the Swedish commercial real estate sector. Findings – Only half of the companies included in the study conduct formal evaluations, although they are considered to work customer oriented. Two different strategies for using formal evaluations is, for improvement work and for signalling quality. One proposed explanation to why only half of the companies conduct formal evaluations is the possibility that the official Swedish Real Estate Barometer is not sufficient if the company would like to use the result for organisational development. There are instead indications that this barometer <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in publicity and marketing purpose, to signal quality. Research limitations/implications – The research in this paper is limited to Swedish commercial real estate sector. But, the overall strategies for conducting formal evaluations should be applicable in general. Practical implications – The insight the paper provides regarding how the industry perceive the Swedish Real Estate Barometer gives direct implications of improvements of the barometer. Originality/value – It provides an insight regarding the use of formal customer evaluations and a proposition of how the Swedish Real Estate Barometer could be changed to better support and fulfil the aim of being a barometer for benchmarking...|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis {{we study}} the linear and {{nonlinear}} acoustic field propagation. We also {{look into the}} possibility of estimating the non-linearly generated second harmonic by linear propagation of two times the fundamental frequency. The linear acoustic field propagation is calculated by the numerically implemented angular spectrum approach (ASA). The derivation of the ASA {{is based on the}} convolution theorem applied to Rayleigh-Sommerfeldts diffraction formula. In many cases the acoustic propagation is nonlinear which leads to a generation of harmonic frequencies in addition to the fundamental frequency. To account for the nonlinear effects in the medium a frequency domain solution of Burgers equation is used. The model also accounts for the attenuation of the waveform as it propagates through the medium. The results of the simulations of linear and nonlinear propagation are compared to relevant results presented in a selection of articles to verify the correctness of the simulator. The non-linearly generated second harmonic frequency is often used in medical ultrasound imaging. Due to the fact that medical ultrasound <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in imaging the human body, the field only has to be propagated over small distances (no larger than 1 meter). Since sonar technology is based on the same principles as medical ultrasound {{there is reason to believe}} that second harmonic imaging also could be of great interest in sonar. One of the main differences between sonar technology and medical ultrasound is the fact that the acoustic field is propagated over much larger distances in sonar. Taking into account the large number of harmonics which are often involved in the simulation of nonlinear field propagation and the fact that the field has to be propagated over much larger distances (from several meters to several kilometers), the simulation of nonlinear acoustics can be very time consuming in sonar. In this thesis we look into the possibility of estimating the second harmonic by linear propagation of two times the fundamental frequency...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on seven papers and has three main {{objective}}s. The first objective {{is to provide a}} theoretical framework that explains the dynamics of quality attributes over their life cycles, considering the technology readiness of users. Empirical investigations have been conducted with questionnaires constructed by a combination of Kano's theory of attractive quality and technology readiness, to collect data about a service consisting of a number of quality attributes. The results indicate that this theoretical combination, together with information about the number of times a service has been used, enables organizations to estimate how far the service has come in its life cycle and {{how long it will take}} to complete the cycle. This can be a helpful aid when estimating the pace at which an organization needs to offer new services or service attributes on a market. The second objective is to provide empirical investigations into how dissatisfaction feedback over product life cycles is transferred from users, and how that information and knowledge is utilized in product development contexts. Three research studies were conducted. One is an explorative collective case study carried out at three organizations in three multinational manufacturing companies in Sweden. The second is a descriptive single case study conducted in a collaboration project with ALSTOM Power, Industrial Turbines. The third is a multiple case study covering 84 % of the companies within a machine industry segment in Sweden. As a general conclusion, the results show that feedback <b>mainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> for corrective and reactive actions only (exploitation of products), and is seldom used as an input in the New Product Development Process when developing possible future products (exploration of products). The third objective is to investigate manufacturing companies' current positions and movements on a goods-to-services continuum. The results of an explorative multiple case study of 17 machine industry companies suggest that most of the companies have not reached very far on the goods-to-services continuum. However, most of them are interested in better utilizing the life cycles of goods by incorporating service development activities within their lines of business...|$|E
