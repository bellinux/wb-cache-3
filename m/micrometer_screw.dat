50|$|The {{reason for}} this strange mechanism, {{is that the first}} ball (ideally) makes contact with the fixed frame at exactly three points, the second ball at two, and the third ball at just one.

A comparison with real organ pipes gives some indications for the range of the parameters.

A mathematical relation of the centerline velocity {{as a function of the}} cut-up height L is found. The results of edge tone measurements show differences between previous studies and the present one. No frequency stages (and hysteresis phenomena) are found within the investigated pressure and cut-up range; the frequency modes of the edge tone coexist.

5000|$|The {{basic concept}} is to {{introduce}} a split element into a telescope's optical path so as to produce a double image. If one element is moved using a screw micrometer, precise angle measurements can be made. The simplest arrangement is to split the object lens in half, with one half fixed and the other attached to the <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> and slid along the cut diameter. To measure {{the diameter of the}} sun, for example, the micrometer is first adjusted so that the two images of the solar disk coincide (the [...] "zero" [...] position where the split elements form essentially a single element). The micrometer is then adjusted so that diametrically opposite sides of the two images of the solar disk just touch each other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the (angular) diameter of the sun. Similarly, a precise measurement of the apparent separation between two nearby stars, A and B, is made by first superimposing the two images of the stars and then adjusting the double image so that star A in one image coincides with star B in the other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the apparent separation or angular distance between the two stars.|$|E
5000|$|Near {{each end}} of the axis, {{attached}} to the axis and turning with it, was a circle or wheel for measuring the angle of the telescope to the horizon. Generally of 3 feet to 3.5 ft diameter, it was divided to 2 or 5 arcminutes, on a slip of silver set into the face of the circle near the circumference. These graduations were read by microscopes, generally four for each circle, mounted to the piers or a framework surrounding the axis, at 90° intervals around the circles. By averaging the four readings the eccentricity (from inaccurate centering of the circles) and the errors of graduation were greatly reduced. Each microscope was furnished with a <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw,</b> which moved crosshairs, with which the distance of the circle graduations from the centre of the field of view could be measured. The drum of the screw was divided to measure single seconds of arc (0.1" [...] being estimated), while the number of revolutions were counted by a kind of comb in the field of view. The microscopes were placed at such a distance from the circle that one revolution of the screw corresponded to 1 arcminute (1') on the circle. The error was determined occasionally by measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. The periodic errors of the screw were accounted for. On some instruments, one of the circles was graduated and read more coarsely than the other, and was used only in finding the target stars.|$|E
5000|$|Jean-Félix Picard (21 July 1620 [...] - [...] 12 July 1682) was a French {{astronomer}} and priest born in La Flèche, {{where he}} studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand. He died in Paris, France. He {{was the first person}} to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted in 1669 - 70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus's methodology and Snellius's mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter-minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe's four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation.|$|E

The complete version can be consulted at the University of Leicester Library. The application and perfecting of the screw for scientific purposes has been studied for the period ca. 1600 - 1900. An historical review of the means of producing screws, with special attention to precision screws, provides the basis for historical studies of the application of the screw to various types of micrometers and dividing engines. Developmental histories of micrometers, mainly astronomical, and dividing engines are also provided. Means of studying the profiles and accuracy of screws have been developed; the methods adopted employ techniques of period searching which are used for variable star studies. The Jurkevich-Swingler period searching technique (a modified Fourier transform method) has been used to study precision screws which may be fundamentally characterized as a periodic phenonena. Using the primary period of the screw thread (the pitch) an 'atlas' of screw profiles has been produced to determine the characteristics of the screws and to search for patterns in the profiles as a function of maker, period and use. The profiles and direct measurements of the <b>micrometer</b> <b>screws</b> have also provided estimates of the errors of the Instruments. Summaries and graphical analysis of these data have permitted a search for relationships between some of the fundamental characteristics of various classes of screws. These studies have identified the most serious types of errors encountered in precision-screws. Estimates of the accuracy of the best machining capabilities and the accuracy of astronomical observations and scale dividing, etc. as a function of time are provided. These estimates are compared with contemporary estimates and modern estimates for other types of related mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In autumn 2001, the Institut für Erdmessung (IfE), {{received}} the new Scintrex Autograv CG- 3 M spring gravimeter no. 4492 (SC- 4492). Compared with LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters, the Scintrex instrument offers {{the advantage of}} a more simple calibration function. Due to the straightforward sensor design (no <b>micrometer</b> <b>screws</b> and gearboxes, no astatisation), a modelling of periodical calibration terms and of a higher order polynomial calibration function is not required. The costly calibration measurements can be reduced to some relative observations between two reliable absolute gravity stations. No complex calibration system should be necessary. A reliable evaluation of the SC- 4492 was done with respect to the stability of the calibration, measurement accuracy and precision, drift behaviour, and gravity range dependency of the calibration factor. Measurements were performed on the Hannover vertical calibration line (200 µm/s 2 (20 mGal) range, 20 -storied building, 10 µm/s 2 interval), on the Cuxhaven-Harz north-south line (3000 µm/s 2 range, 34 stations, 90 µm/s 2 interval) of the gravimeter calibration system Hannover, and in the absolute gravimetry net of the Fennoscandian land uplift area (6200 µm/s 2 range). A total gravity range of almost 0. 015 m/s 2 has been covered. In addition, the gravimeter was employed in the determination of vertical gravity gradients and centring to safety points for absolute gravimetry, and the observation of the horizontal gradient field at the IfE absolute gravity reference station in Clausthal. This paper presents the results as obtained in regional, local and microgravimetric surveys. The achieved accuracies are in the order of ± 10 to 100 nm/s 2 (± 1 to 10 µGal). No instability of the calibration and no gravity range dependency could be proven within the order of 1 • 10 - 4. Overall, the gravity meter SC- 4492 meets fully the expectations of IfE...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of many aerospace structures {{is limited by}} the {{accuracy of}} assembly tooling which is in turn limited by the accuracy of the measurements used to set the tooling. Further loss of accuracy results from different rates of thermal expansion for the components and tooling. This paper describes improved tooling designs and setting processes which have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of aerospace structures. The most advanced solution described is environmentally isolated interferometer networks embedded within tooling combined with active compensation of component pick-ups. This would eliminate environmental effects on measurements while also allowing compensation for thermal expansion.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} method to convert {{computer}} images to a holographic film plate. In the recording process of holographic multi-stereograms, one uses a liquid crystal display (LCD) to show 70 different pictures of a constructed object. These pictures show the object from 70 different positions, and in a sequence the object appears as though turned over the LCD. Each of the pictures is exposed in a different area of the film and the film position is controlled by the holographic printer. The result of this recording process is a 3 -D image of the object with horizontal parallax, constructed from 70 different 2 -D computer pictures. At the start of thesis search for relevant literature was given high priority, where the purpose was to find what kind of optical equipment and quality was needed for these experiments. Most papers recommended the He-Ne laser, silver halide film emulsion and developers like Agfa GP 62 and Kodak D- 19. As for the quality of the optical equipment, mirrors need a flatness of the order of 1 / 10 ⋅λ, and lenses must have minimal aberrations. Before the making of a holographic multi-stereogram, the optical equipment and set-up for recording holograms together with developing process were examined. In order to find a practical favourable method, preliminary holography experiments where carried out. In these experiments, there were practical problems like instability, reflections, depolarisation and exposure. The developing and bleaching processes were also tried out, and gave good results. In order to produce a holographic multi-stereogram, it was necessary to procure some more optical equipment. Some of the equipment was made in the work-shop in the Institute of Physics: - <b>Micrometer</b> <b>screws</b> for the spatial filter. It is possible to change the pinhole from 25 μm to 10 μm. The result is a cleaner laser beam. - New slit on the holographic printer. The angle is larger and the possibility of shadows is reduced. - <b>Micrometer</b> <b>screws</b> on the holographic printers slit. It is possible to adjust the width of the slit easily and precisely to the right size. - Table extension for the optical breadboard, used in the production of reflection and rainbow holograms. - Table holder for breadboard and the table extension. - Mirror holder to transfer laser light from the optical table (lower level) to the breadboard (upper level). - Glass cage mounted on the optical table to protect the equipment from air vibrations. Other optical equipment bought from different companies : 4 34 35 - High quality lenses - Mirrors with flatness 1 / 10 ⋅λ. - Liquid crystal display (LCD). - Optical breadboard. The optical breadboard made it possible to arrange the optical equipment at two levels on the table. This is very practical in the production of holographic multi-stereograms. - High power red He-Ne laser with 24 mW output power. The production of holographic transmission multi-stereogram is time-consuming; the recording time can be 30 minutes and for reflection holograms several hours. Therefore, the laser output power stability must be constant in the exposure of holographic multi-stereogram. The power stability is measured for 2 different periods at different sampling rate, which shows the laser power stability is very good. It is important the laser is sufficiently heated before recording holograms. The heating time must be at least 1 hour. The laser’s coherence length is measured with help of Michelson’s set-up, and is measured to be 30 cm. From the visibility plot the contrast of the hologram will fall from 1 to 0. 8 for 5 cm laser beam path difference. It is very important that the reference and object beam have the same path length. To produce high quality holograms the stability of the laser beam and the optical equipment must be good. Vibrations of the interference fringes on the film plate for more than 1 / 10 ⋅λ reduce the brightness of the hologram. Therefore, the optical equipment’s stability and quality have to be very good to meet this requirement. Several different vibrational measurements have been made on the optical table. The first is made with the glass cage and the second without. The plot shows distinctly that the measurement without the glass cage has higher vibrational amplitude than the measurement with the class cage. A vibrational measurement of the recording process of the holographic multi-stereogram recording is also made. This measurement shows the printer makes a high vibration amplitude when the motor is running, but the optical table is stable 1 - 2 seconds after the motor has stopped. There are no vibrations measured when the shutter moves (open/close). With the use of the printer and the shutter, which is the equipment that moves under the recording process, there are no vibrational problems for the production of holographic multi-stereogram. The thermal stability requirement for the film plate is very high, a change of temperature for more than 0. 1 °K makes reduction of the hologram quality. Several holographic recordings were made: transmission, reflection and rainbow holograms made with 1 -step and 2 -step methods. For all of the recordings made with the 1 -step method, {{it is not possible to}} get rid of the vertical lines from the slit of the printer. With the use of the 2 -step method, where a master hologram is copied onto a new hologram the problem of lines from the slit was solved. From a master transmission holographic multi-stereogram, high quality 2 -step reflection and rainbow holograms were produced. There were also produced 13 reflection holograms of good quality for EPM Consultants, who have co-operated in this thesis work...|$|R
30|$|In the turgor {{pressure}} measurement, the coarse bark firstly was slightly scraped with a blunt knife. Then, using a special micro cork borer, {{a small hole}} of approximately 2 - 3  mm in depth was punctured down to the hard wood of the bark to ensure the whole phloem was penetrated and measured. The cork borer was made from a hypodermic injection needle (14 #) with the tip removed and modified (Hammel 1968). The borer can bring bark debris out when it removes out to {{lower the risk of}} system blockage without damaging the xylem. Following the withdrawing of the borer, the micropipette tip of the PTPP was immediately inserted tightly into the hole. The latex will flow out rapidly from many severed laticifers into the PTPP system and pressurize the silicon oil inside it. The pressure inside the PTPP was recorded with a pressure transducer (26 PCFA 6 D, Honeywell, Germany) and a data logger (92101 Sensor-interface, Burster, Germany) to monitor the pressure change. During the measurement, the pressure inside the system can be changed while the latex exudation from the wounded laticifers was slowed, stopped or reversed by adjusting the <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> {{at the end of the}} probe. The reliability of the measured {{turgor pressure}} could also be confirmed by a relaxation (suction) drop and a subsequently quick recovery of the pressure by adjusting the <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> because the H. brasiliensis laticifer is a big reservoir of latex.|$|E

The position of 0  mm was identified with the simple contact of the screw with the canvas. The laser scan was performed on the areas A and B, {{at the front of the}} canvas, during the first tensioning test, and on the area C, at the back of the canvas, during the second one.

The milled rice samples were classified according to the size and shape classification of rice done by the International Rice Research Institute [18].

50|$|The {{most common}} type of mirror mount is the {{kinematic}} mount. This type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy. Typically, the movable frame that holds the mirror pivots on a ball bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame. Ideally this hole should be trihedral (pyramid-shaped). Often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture. The frame is pivoted by means of two <b>micrometers</b> or fine-thread <b>screws,</b> tipped with steel ball bearings. One of these ball bearings rests in a V-groove, the other rests on a flat surface. On cheaper mounts, the flat surface may be simply the material of the mount. In more expensive mounts, the flat surface (and perhaps the hole and v-groove too) may be made out of a much harder material (often sapphire), set into the frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of thou {{as a base}} unit for machining work required the dissemination of vernier calipers and <b>screw</b> <b>micrometers</b> throughout the trade, as the unit {{is too small to}} be measured with practical repeatability using rules alone. (Most rule markings were far too wide to mark a single mil, and even if such dividing is accomplished, it is illegible to the naked eye, being discernible but not useful for measuring.) During the following half century, such measuring instruments went from expensive rarities to widespread, everyday use among machinists. Bringing more metrology into machining increased the separation of concerns to make possible, for example, designing an assembly to the point of an engineering drawing, then having the mating parts made at different firms who did not have any contact with (or even awareness of) each other—yet still knowing with certainty that their products would have the desired fit.|$|R

Reference measurements were per-formed with a <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> and a goniometer. Patient leg length and axis were compared with long radiographs in bipedal stance. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and accuracy were calculated using the mean abso-lute difference (MAD) and the 95 % confidence interval. In patients, com-parisons were done using a paired Student’s t-test. MAD, intraobserver MAD, and interobserver MAD wer...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{treatment}} temperature on the dielectric properties of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies L.) was investigated. Wood disks with {{a diameter of}} 45 mm and a thickness of 5 mm were thermally treated at seven different temperatures (50 to 200 °C) before measurements were performed. Dielectric properties of the wood disks were measured at nine various frequencies (2 to 10 MHz) at room temperature. The impedance analyzer HP 4191 A RF and the <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> method with circular aluminum electrodes were used. The {{results indicate that the}} dielectric constant and the loss tangent of wood decrease as the temperature of the thermal treatment increases, provided the temperature is higher than 100 °C. The dielectric constant also decreases with increasing weight loss of the specimen...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{an imprint}} {{is the first}} stage of {{indirect}} fix prosthetics restoration and preparation and choosing impression material that fulfils the requirements for accurate and precise printing is of great importance. The aim of this research is to responds to the measure and compare the dimensional stability of the additional and condensational elastomeric silicon’s impression materials in a different time sequence and to highlight the importance of the outpouring of print within 2 hours, after taking the print. For the analysis of dimensional stability are used most commonly used silicone impression elastomeric materials that takes an imprint in the production of restorations fix prosthetics condensational silicone (Xantopren Comfort Heraeus Kulzer) and an additional silicone (Variotime Easy Putty Heraeus Kulzer). During the research materials were placed {{in the same room with}} a stable temperature of 21 - 23 º. Both impression materials was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample is phantom model of an upper jaw with stuffed first premolar and first molar. Stuffed dental nog are marked cervical border, in the longest distance in two directions buccal-oral and distal-mesial. With standard No. 3 spoons taken by an imprint of both types of silicone condensational silicone (Xantopren Comfort Heraeus Kulzer) and an additional silicone (Variotime Easy Putty Heraeus Kulzer). Imprints are poured with a super hard, yellow plaster (Hera Moldastone tipe IV, Heraeus) at different time’s sequence. They were made of 8 patterns at different time period: immediately after 4 hours, 12 hours and 48 hours. Received 4 models print from condensational silicone and 4 models print from an additional silicone. Were measuring 16 stuffed dental nog in 32 measuring points. The obtained model was conducted measuring the previously marked areas of the prepared tooth nog using a <b>screw</b> <b>micrometers</b> (MEBA) with a measurement accuracy of 0, 01 mm. The methodological tools that is used is based on the finding of the impact of the time factor on the dimensional stability of prints from two different impression materials and mutual comparing the results obtained with manual survey of replica models printout of an additional and condensational silicone and comparing them with the control model. The results are expressed in millimeters and percentages. Dimensional changes between model and its reproductions occurred as a consequence of dimensional instability impression material. The results indicate that in both directions, with each successive measurement was continuously increasing dimensional change. In measuring replica models derived from the print of an additional impression silicone material can be noted that the dimensional changes occurring are much smaller than the dimensional changes that occurred in replica models derived from the prints of condensational silicon, indicating that the additional of silicon was dimensionally stable than condensational. Dimensional changes between the model and its reproductions resulted from the dimensional instability impression material. The difference was greater in print taken with condensation silicone (0. 78...|$|R
30|$|If the IRR {{camera was}} focused on the high point of the panel, near the center, and no focus {{adjustments}} were made as the painting was scanned, the individual IRR image frames would blur near the left and right sides. Two different actions could be taken to restore focus as the IRR image frames were collected. One option would be to adjust the focus of the lens, but this would change the magnification. The other option would be to leave the focus of the lens unchanged and adjust the distance between the camera and the painting until the image is in focus again. Only the latter approach would keep the image magnification fixed while scanning, and thus this latter approach was used. The IR camera system was mounted on a translation stage with a <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw,</b> which allowed moving the camera along the optical axis of the lens, the z-axis.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the possibility of using}} transparent stretchable diffraction gratings for spectrometric applications. The gratings were fabricated by replication of a triangular-groove master into a transparent viscoelastic. The sample length, and hence the spatial period, can be reversibly changed by mechanical stretching. When used in a monochromator with two slits, the stretchable grating permits scanning the spectral components over the output slit, converting the monochromator into a scanning spectrometer. The spectral resolution of such a spectrometer was found to be limited mainly by the wave-front aberrations due to the grating deformation. A model relating the deformation-induced aberrations in different diffraction orders is presented. In the experiments, a 12 -mm long viscoelastic grating with a spatial frequency of 600 line pairs/mm provided a full-width at half-maximum resolution of up to ~ 1. 2 nm in the 580 - 680 nm spectral range when slowly stretched by a <b>micrometer</b> <b>screw</b> and ~ 3 nm when repeatedly stretched by a voice coil at 15 Hz. Comparison of aberrations in transmitted and diffracted beams measured by a Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor showed that astigmatisms caused by stretch-dependent wedge deformation are the main factors limiting the resolution of the viscoelastic-grating-based spectrometer.
