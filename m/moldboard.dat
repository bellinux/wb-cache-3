5|$|Heavy <b>moldboard</b> iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the {{earliest}} discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy <b>moldboard</b> plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The <b>moldboard</b> allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the <b>moldboard</b> attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy <b>moldboard</b> iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
25|$|By the Tang Dynasty (618–907), China {{had become}} a unified feudal {{agricultural}} society. Improvements in farming machinery during this era included the <b>moldboard</b> plow and watermill. Later during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), cotton planting and weaving technology were extensively adopted and improved.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural Engineering Department, College of Agriculture, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the mechanization provisions as well as the uniformity of level of mechanization among the modern farms in Saudi Arabia. Field data of 56 farms was studied on the basis of tractor power and implement size available per unit area. The average tractor power per hectare was found to be 1. 84 kw. The width of machines and implements such as combines, chisels, <b>moldboards,</b> seed drills and bailers were 0. 051, 0. 052, 0. 026, 0. 047 and 0. 025 m. /ha. The average number of tractors per farm was 2. 32 and that for combines, chisels, <b>moldboards,</b> seed drills and bailers were 1. 21, 1. 43, 1. 43, 1. 26 and 1. 20, respectively. On the basis of width of machine or implement per unit area, the acquirement of farmers for tractors, chisels and <b>moldboards</b> was inconsistent. However, the acquirement of the combine and seed drills on the basis of the machine width per unit area was more con-sistent. Improper selection of tractors and/or implements was attributed to lack of technical data and farm-ing experience among the farmers...|$|R

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Winston sat swaying on the driving-seat, mechanically {{guiding the}} horses, and noticing how the prairie sod rolled away in black waves beneath the great plow. He heard the crackle of fibers beneath the triple shares, and the swish of greasy loam along the <b>moldboard's</b> side, but his thoughts were far away, {{and when he}} raised his head, {{he looked into the}} dim future beyond the long furrow that cut the skyline on the rise.|$|R
25|$|Some areas {{experienced}} {{slow but}} steady technological advances, with important developments such as the stirrup and <b>moldboard</b> plough arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the Mediterranean area during the Hellenistic period, when hundreds of technologies were invented. Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the Roman Empire's decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period.|$|E
25|$|John Deere {{developed}} a cast steel plow in 1837 which was lightweight {{and had a}} <b>moldboard</b> that efficiently turned over and shed the plowed earth. It was easy for a horse to pull and was well suited to cutting the thick prairie sod of the Midwest. He and his brother Charles founded Deere and Company which continues into the 21st century as the largest maker of tractors, combines, harvesters and other farm implements.|$|E
25|$|To grow crops {{regularly}} in less-fertile areas, the soil must be turned to bring nutrients to the surface. A major advance {{for this type}} of farming was the turnplough, also known as the mouldboard plough (UK), <b>moldboard</b> plow (US), or frame-plough. A coulter (or skeith) could be added to cut vertically into the ground just ahead of the share (in front of the frog), a wedge-shaped cutting edge at the bottom front of the mouldboard with the landside of the frame supporting the undershare (below-ground component).|$|E

The results showed the advantage, in grain yield, of wheat that crop precedent is fallow relatively to wheat following wheat. Tool effect of tillage soil is related to crop precedent. Indeed, Waha cultivated under fallow tilled with scarifier produced more grain than after wheat.

5000|$|Tillage is the {{agricultural}} preparation of soil by mechanical [...] of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with <b>moldboards</b> or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends {{to use the}} smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or no-till methods as well.|$|R

He had left the {{homestead}} before it was light that morning to set his steam-plow to work, though nobody at Allenwood had taken a team from the stable yet. Devine had told her of the trouble they had encountered: how the soft soil clogged the <b>moldboards,</b> and the wheels sank, and the coulters crashed against patches of unthawed ground. This, however, had not stopped Harding. There was {{work to be done}} and he must get about it in the best way he could. At supper time he came home in very greasy overalls, looking tired, {{but as soon as the}} meal was finished he took out some papers, and now, at last, he laid down his pen and sat with knitted brows and clenched hand.|$|R
25|$|The plow {{is a tool}} used {{in farming}} for initial {{cultivation}} of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and {{represents one of the}} major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron <b>moldboard.</b> Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.|$|E
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the <b>moldboard</b> plow. The share makes the {{horizontal}} cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the <b>moldboard</b> to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E
500|$|Rich {{families}} who owned oxen and large heavy <b>moldboard</b> iron plows greatly benefited from this new system. However, poorer farmers {{who did not}} own oxen resorted to using teams of men to move a single plow, which was exhausting work. The author Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) wrote in his Simin yueling (四民月令) that by the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE) an improved plow was invented which needed only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it, had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil, and could sow roughly [...] of land in a single day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} {{called the}} Oliver Chilled Plow Works {{was established by}} James Oliver in 1853. [...] James Oliver first settled in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a local foundry business. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Indiana. Plows with cast iron bottoms and <b>moldboards</b> had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States {{since the time of}} Thomas Jefferson. [...] However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not [...] "scour"; that is, the sticky soil would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in sticky soil, various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal plow bottom had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include rapid chilling of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms.|$|R
500|$|The {{contemporaneous}} Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures {{represent the}} oldest Neolithic cultures of China and were formed around 7000 BC. Some {{of the first}} inventions of Neolithic China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives, stone hoes and spades, the cultivation of millet, rice, and the soybean, the refinement of sericulture, the building of rammed earth structures with lime-plastered house floors, the creation of pottery with cord-mat-basket designs, the creation of pottery tripods and pottery steamers {{and the development of}} ceremonial vessels and scapulimancy for purposes of divination. The British sinologist Francesca Bray argues that the domestication of the ox and buffalo during the Longshan culture (c. 3000–c. 2000 BC) period, the absence of Longshan-era irrigation or high-yield crops, full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land cereal crops which gave high yields [...] "only when the soil was carefully cultivated," [...] suggest that the plough was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–c. 1050 BC).

2500|$|Removal of ergot bodies is done {{by placing}} the yield in a brine solution; the ergot bodies float while the healthy grains sink.
