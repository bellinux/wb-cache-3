50|$|Assuming equal {{operating}} parameters to an 802.11g network achieving 54 <b>megabits</b> per <b>second</b> (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna), an 802.11n network can achieve 72 <b>megabits</b> per <b>second</b> (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna and 400 ns guard interval); 802.11n's speed may {{go up to}} 150 <b>megabits</b> per <b>second</b> if there aren't other Bluetooth, microwave or Wi-Fi emissions in the neighborhood by using two 20 MHz channels in 40 MHz mode. If more antennas are used, then 802.11n can go up to 288 <b>megabits</b> per <b>second</b> in 20 MHz mode with four antennas, or 600 <b>megabits</b> per <b>second</b> in 40 MHz mode with four antennas and 400 ns guard interval. Because the 2.4 GHz band is seriously congested in most urban areas, 802.11n networks usually have more success in increasing data rate by utilizing more antennas in 20 MHz mode rather than by operating in the 40 MHz mode, as the 40 MHz mode requires a relatively free radio spectrum which is only available in rural areas away from cities. Thus, network engineers installing an 802.11n network should strive to select routers and wireless clients with the most antennas possible (one, two, three or four as specified by the 802.11n standard) {{and try to make}} sure that the network's bandwidth will be satisfactory even on the 20 MHz mode.|$|R

40|$|During a {{bulk data}} {{transfer}} over a high speed network, {{there is a}} high probability that the next packet received from the network by the destination host is the next packet in the transfer.

No copying of the data is required in the common case, and overhead is greatly reduced.
