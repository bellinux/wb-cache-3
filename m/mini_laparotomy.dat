40|$|Many {{methods are}} used for the {{placement}} of Tenckhoff catheters. Eighteen consecutive Tenckhoff catheters were placed under local anesthesia through a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> with a reduced operating team. There were only three total catheter failures.

30|$|No major {{intraoperative}} complications were noted. Two {{procedures were}} converted to a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy,</b> one due to technical difficulties in closing the uterine incision and the other due to anaesthetic concerns with the patient’s ventilation, giving a conversion rate of 0.62 %. Nine patients required post-operative blood transfusions (2.79 %). Seven patients had documented post-operative complications (2.17 %); one patient returned to theatre on day 2 due to intra-abdominal bleeding, which was managed by a laparotomy and re-suturing. Two patients had post-operative urinary retention, and four patients developed port site hernias.|$|E
30|$|Our {{case report}} {{demonstrates}} {{the difficulty of}} managing interstitial pregnancies and avoiding recurrence. At her first presentation to us, a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> and excision of the right tubal stump was performed. Unfortunately, the interstitial portion of a damaged tube is not removed by routine salpingectomy or, in this case, by excision of tubal stump. At her second presentation, endoloop before evacuation of conceptus method was used; however, residual trophoblasic tissue remained which was successfully treated with mifepristone and single-dose systemic methotrexate. At her third presentation, a laparoscopically performed right cornual ligation and excision was carried out with good results.|$|E
40|$|This {{international}} study depoliticizes {{the issue}} and emphasizes that voluntary sterilization is a basic service which should be available everywhere. A transumbilical <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> is a fast and safe pro-cedure, which should be carried out within hours of delivery- even on Saturdays and Sundays. Cae-sarean section when sterilization is the only indication is completely unjustified. SAl, Med J 1986; 70 : 540 - 541.

40|$|Genital TB {{may present}} as on abdominopelvic mass {{mimicking}} ovarian malignancy because clinical and laboratory findings are similar. Family history {{is very important}} and should be considered for differential diagnosis. Three cases of genital TB with presentation of abdominopelvic masses and with no {{signs and symptoms of}} TB were presented. Two of them had positive family history of pulmonary TB. Tissue diagnosis was the best method for diagnosis of genital TB, but it should be reminded that if positive family history of TB was present, <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> should be done to take biopsy and to make rapid diagnosis before treatment.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of cancer in}} a hernia sac is uncommon. The tumor can involve the hernia sac, the herniated mass or be external to the hernia sac. We report two cases with this condition. A 68 years old male was operated of a right inguinal hernia. During surgery, several white nodules were noted in the internal side of hernia sac. The same lesions {{were present in the}} mesentery. Pathological study revealed an adenocarcinoma. The primary tumor was not located and the patient died one and a half years after the procedure. A 62 years old male was operated due to an irreductible inguinal mass, seven months after a subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. During the resection of the mass, metastasic implants in the mesenteric adipose tissue were noted. A <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> was performed and an extensive peritoneal tumor dissemination was found. The patient died two months after surgery (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 91 - 9...|$|E
40|$|Severe obesity {{leads to}} a high {{incidence}} of complications and a decrease in life expectancy, especially among younger adults. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) first intended as the first step of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch is gaining a per-se procedure role because of its effectiveness on weight loss and comorbidity resolution. Different techniques have been described for specimen extraction in LSG. In this article we report the technique adopted in 275 LSGs performed in our department. In the first 120 LSGs performed from 2007, the specimen was extracted through a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy.</b> In the following 155 cases the technique has been simplified: the grasped specimen has been withdrawn through the 15  mm trocar site. We registered in the fist group six cases of wound infection (5 %), ten cases of hematoma (8. 3 %) and four cases of port site hernia (3. 3 %). In the second group only one case of hematoma (0. 6 %, p =  0. 01) but no cases of wound infection (p =  0. 01) or port site hernia, (p =  0. 03) although we registered a specimen perforation during retrieval in 16 patients, were reported. The technique described in the 155 cases of the control group has shown to be more effective than the technique we used in the case group, allowing significantly lower operative time (112. 9  ±  1. 0 vs 74. 9  ±  9. 1 p <  0. 001) and complications, and providing unchanged costs...|$|E
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug-induced {{small bowel}} diaphragm disease Small bowel diaphragm disease is rarely seen in clinical practice and can pose a diagnostic dilemma. We present an interesting case of {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) enteropathy following self-medication. A 42 -year-old woman presented with history of colicky abdominal pain, anaemia and weight loss. She had taken ibuprofen (self-medication) t. d. s. for 7 months. Endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis were normal. Barium studies on the small bowel were normal. A diagnostic laparoscopy showed an area of stricturing in distal small bowel. This was resected and histology showed NSAID-induced small bowel diaphragm. She was taken off ibuprofen and started on proton pump inhibitors. Unfortunately her symptoms returned after a year. It was {{found out that she}} continued to take NSAID over the counter. She underwent a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> and 100 cm of proximal ileum with 30 diaphragms (strictures) was resected (Figs 1, 2). Histology confirmed NSAID enteropathy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug uptake by enterocytes uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial damage and increased permeability. This exposes bowel wall to luminal contents and causes damage. The cytoprotective property of prostaglandins is also lost because of its inhibition. Systemic effects after absorption and recurrent local effects due to enterohepatic circulation have also been suggested, namely macroscopic is multiple circumferential strictures and microscopic is submucosal fibrosis similar to chronic ischaemia. Patients present with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, iron deficiency anaemia, pain, weight loss, hypoproteinaemia and obstruction. Investigations, such as endoscopy, barium studies, CT scan and laparoscopy can be useful but may yield false-negative results. Capsule enteroscopy is effective but may precipitate obstructio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Despite the {{decrease}} in operative mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy over last decades, operative morbidity remains high and overall survival is still poor. As such, minimally invasive surgery for periampullary malignancy is generally considered of limited value. We assessed {{the role of a}} hybrid minimally invasive approach in patients treated for early clinical stage pancreatic and periampullary cancer and analyzed operative and short-term surgical outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained hepatobiliary database under IRB approval. All patients who received robotic assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic or periampullary malignancies were included. The surgical approach consisted of a laparoscopic portion including exploration, cholecystectomy, kocherization of the duodenum, mobilization and division of the stomach and intestine. This was followed by robotic dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament, pancreatic neck and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Finally a <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> was used to divide the pancreas and perform the reconstruction. Patients’ demographics, operative data, pathology results and short-term outcomes were analyzed. Results Eleven consecutive patients, underwent surgery for clinical stage I and II biopsy proven pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (n= 8), neuroendocrine carcinoma (n= 2) and duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n= 1). Average operative time was 475 minutes. Average estimated blood loss was 375 mL; there was no perioperative or 90 days mortality. 27 % of patients received perioperative blood transfusions. There were no grade B/C pancreatic fistulas. Mean hospital length of stay was seven days and readmission rate was 27 %. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed 100 % R 0 resection with an average lymph node retrieval of 14. Conclusion The hybrid approach is safe and may be an acceptable introduction for a totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy. It offers the patients the advantages of a minimally invasive approach, maintains the classical surgical reconstruction phase and provides a flexible platform for the surgeon to gradually integrate the robotic technique...|$|E
30|$|Results: In seven {{consecutive}} patients {{during the}} time period of 10 to 19 Nov 2006 two total hysterectomies and BSO (AAGL type IVE), one sacral colposuspension with BSO, one ovarian cystectomy, one Burch colposuspension combined with paravaginal repair, an enucleation of 10  cm myoma with reconstruction of myometrium, and a radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy were attempted and completed robotically without conversion to unintended laparotomy or to conventional laparoscopy. One case was completed without conventional laparoscopic assistance using a robotic multipurpose instrument, reported as the first case of total robotic hysterectomy. In the first group the median age was 50  years, the median BMI 26.6, the combined median operative time 345  min (range 150 – 480) and the variation in Hb 1.4  g/dl with a median EBL of 200  ml. Median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 4  days (range 1 – 6). This group was complicated by a cystotomy, a tear like lesion, successfully managed by robotic suturing. This was a surgeon’s related complication {{due to lack of}} experience along with the absence of tactile feedback. A transverse low abdominal <b>mini</b> <b>laparotomy</b> was performed for the extraction of a 122 [*]×[*] 84 [*]×[*] 87  mm fibroid with uterus and bilateral adnexae due to malfunction of laparoscopic morcelator. In the second group the median age was 45  years with median BMI 25, 9. The combined median operative time was 240  min (range 120 – 270) and the variation in Hb 1.5  g/dl with a median EBL of 250  ml. The LOS was 3  days (range 2 – 5). Complications concerned a RBC transfusion and a blunt trauma to the bladder wall, which extended the LOS. There were no major intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications, and no robotic related complications or failure were noted. Although all cases had a successful outcome, more severe complications, mainly long-term postoperative ones (re-prolapse of vaginal vault, 18  months later), and an extended operative time were encountered in the non-expert group. A distinct and demanding new role of the next to patient surgeon was identified. In a much inconvenient ergonomic position, a combination and a wide range of skills regarding laparotomy, vaginal, laparoscopic and robotic surgery is required.|$|E
