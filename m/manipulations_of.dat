While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|Harmonic <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> {{this kind}} {{create a sense}} of standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of detachment, of {{entering}} a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm of dreams and memories (if the preceding material is conceived as reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material is conceived as home).|$|E

5|$|In January 1909, Austro-Hungarian admirals {{circulated}} {{a document}} {{calling for a}} fleet of four dreadnoughts. A constitutional crisis in 1909–10 meant no construction could be approved. In spite of this, two dreadnoughts were laid down by shipyards on a speculative basis – due especially to the energetic <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> Rudolf Montecuccoli, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy – and later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all , were {{to be accompanied by}} a further four ships, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical <b>manipulations</b> <b>of,</b> or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E

25|$|On 17 May 2017 the Interior Ministry of Berlin {{stated that}} already in November 2016 {{intelligence}} was given that Anis Amri {{was involved in}} criminal offenses concerning drug trafficking. On this basis authorities {{would have been able}} to apprehend Amri already at the time, however they did not. An investigation was launched trying to find out to what extent these informations were withhold by the State Criminal Police Office of Berlin after the attack happened. Several days later, while the investigation for obstruction of justice was still going on, a speaker of the Interior Ministry said that <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> the file of Amri have been carried out by officers of the criminal investigation department after the attack. On 22 May 2017 a commission of inquiry was initiated starting in July. Meanwhile a special prosecuter was appointed to the case. In addition to the ongoing investigation concerning <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> the file and withholding of information, national TV reported on 1 June, that officers who were ordered by an investigating judge in Berlin to observe Amri until October 2016 for criminal offenses and possible terrorist links did not do so and instead included untrue records regarding observating actions in his file.|$|E

25|$|A keen {{student of}} the {{architecture}} of Michelangelo and the ruins of Antiquity, Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive, if somewhat idiosyncratic, architecture employing <b>manipulations</b> <b>of</b> Classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings.
