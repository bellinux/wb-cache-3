500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
500|$|By 1566, Nostradamus's gout, {{which had}} plagued him painfully {{for many years}} and made {{movement}} very difficult, turned into edema, or dropsy. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around $300,000 US today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages. This was followed by a much shorter codicil. On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, [...] "You will not find <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> at sunrise." [...] The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [...] for November 1567, as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened). He was buried in the local Franciscan chapel in Salon (part of it now incorporated into the restaurant La Brocherie) but re-interred during the French Revolution in the Collégiale Saint-Laurent, where his tomb remains to this day.|$|E

This version incorporates the famous [...] "You'll never catch <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> said he" [...] variation introduced by the Billy Tea company. Paterson's original lyrics referred to [...] "drowning himself 'neath the Coolibah Tree". These are the lyrics written in 1903 by Marie Cowan to advertise Billy Tea.|$|E
2500|$|Half {{a century}} later, in his 1972 {{autobiography}} The Making of a Radical, Nearing {{described himself as}} a pacifist, a socialist, and a vegetarian, writing, [...] "I became a vegetarian because I was persuaded that life is as valid for other creatures as it is for humans. I do not need dead animal bodies to keep <b>me</b> <b>alive,</b> strong and healthy. Therefore, I will not kill for food." [...] Nearing listed his four most influential teachers as Henry George, Leo Tolstoy, Simon Nelson Patten, his grandfather, and his mother. Other influences he acknowledged in his memoirs included Socrates, Gautama Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus, Confucius, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Otis Whitman, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Victor Hugo, Edward Bellamy, Olive Schreiner, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Romain Rolland's Jean-Christophe.|$|E

2500|$|Rudge was {{fiercely}} {{proud to}} have always been financially independent of Pound, and continued her career as concert violinist until the Second World War. Her advocacy {{of the works of}} Vivaldi, which included publishing a catalogue of his works and an article in the Grove Dictionary of Music, did much to establish his modern day popularity. She discovered and publicised 309 Vivaldi concertos which had either been lost or forgotten. However, it is as Pound's muse, mistress, and champion that she is chiefly remembered today. Anne Conover's book Olga Rudge and Ezra Pound (2001) {{is one of the few}} to credit Rudge for her own endeavours as well as her role of muse to Ezra Pound. Shortly before his death, Pound wrote of Rudge: There is more courage in Olga's little finger than in the whole of my carcass ... she kept <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> for ten years, for which no one will thank her. The true story will not be told until her version is known.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in keeping <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am so sick of hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she knew what she was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
2500|$|... "Street Life" [...] sees Rowland {{opt for a}} [...] "no BS" [...] attitude. She sings {{about how}} [...] "chasing fast money takes {{precedence}} over self-improvement" [...] atop a mid-2000s pop music production, built around layers of hand drums and horn stabs. It was produced by Pharrell Williams and opens with Rowland saying [...] "Ooh ‘dere go my baby daddy!". The lyrics then continue on {{to speak about the}} current problems society is facing, [...] "the recession ate <b>me</b> <b>alive</b> / Tryin’ to get where the breeze is nice / So I can breath." [...] She then goes on to speak about social issues and the breakdown of society on lyrics like [...] "coming from the street life we know it's letting go / We like to go to school for education / But the street life we know don't write no notes / It's like parole with the time we’re facing." [...] Pusha T appears in the song's middle 8 where he raps about honor and US president Barack Obama, [...] "this is for my niggas with them four baby mamas...this Presidential Rollie don’t make me Obama / so don’t judge me by my jewelry, please your honor". The Huffington Post described [...] "Street Life" [...] as a departure from Rowland's previous [...] "softer sound". The standard edition of the album finishes with [...] "Stand in Front of Me", a 50's doo-wop inspired [...] "ode to love". The simple production and lyrics include the lines [...] "You just do it / Mean it / Prove it"; Hampp of Billboard said you can expect to hear the song at weddings.|$|E
