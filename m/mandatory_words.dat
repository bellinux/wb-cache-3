[...] For instance, while this section indicates that a court is bound ('must') to treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>words</b> are somewhat softened by the later phrase, 'if the court considers that it can reasonably be so treated.' This provision in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is also in tension with its 'limited retributivism' theory of punishment, which underpins the sentencing framework in England and Wales. [...] This is because, generally, increased punishment for subsequent offences based on previous offending, is contrary to retributive principles of punishment and is more closely aligned with utilitarian theories of punishment. [...] Further, in practice (and in contrast to the United States Sentencing Guideline grid, which governs sentencing practice and policy in the federal system) previous convictions, whether spent or unspent (and there is a ten (10) year time limit for consideration of adult convictions) do not lead to a linear increase in sentencing in England and Wales.|$|E

In short, text authored in one source language cannot be exactly reproduced in another target language without difficulty or approximation, {{which is to say}} without requiring more time and greater cost. Since translation represents the conversion of text from one linguistic system source language to another linguistic system target language, the success of the translation process relies on an appropriate conversion and conveyance of meaning, rather than on an exact, mechanical word-for-word transfer from one language into another.

40|$|Aims. A {{solution}} of the radiative-transfer problem in arbitrary velocity fields introduced in a previous paper, has limitations in its applicability. For large-scale applications, the methods described also require large memory sets that are commonly not available to state-of-the-art computing hardware. In this work, we modify the algorithm to allow the computation of large-scale problems. Methods. We reduce the memory footprint via a domain decomposition. By introducing iterative Gauss-Seidel type solvers, we improve {{the speed of the}} overall computation. Because of the domain decomposition, the new algorithm requires the use of parallelcomputing systems. Results. The algorithm that we present permits large-scale solutions of radiative-transfer problems that include arbitrary wavelength couplings. In addition, we discover a quasi-analytic formal {{solution of}} the radiative transfer that significantly improves the overall computation speed. More importantly, this method ensures that our algorithm can be applied to multi-dimensional Lagrangian radiative-transfer calculations. In multi-dimensional atmospheres, velocity fields are in general chaotic ensuring that the inclusion of arbitrary wavelength couplings are <b>mandatory.</b> Key <b>words.</b> radiative transfer 1...|$|R

The importance of a query term is an unknown parameter that explicitly models which of the query terms are generated from the relevant documents (the important terms), and which are not (the unimportant terms).

50|$|Mandatory Corporate Action: A {{mandatory}} {{corporate action}} {{is an event}} initiated {{by the board of}} directors of the corporation that affects all shareholders. Participation of shareholders is mandatory for these corporate actions. An example of a mandatory corporate action is cash dividend. A shareholder does not need to act to receive the dividend. Other examples of mandatory corporate actions include stock splits, mergers, pre-refunding, return of capital, bonus issue, asset ID change and spinoffs. Strictly speaking the <b>word</b> <b>mandatory</b> is not appropriate because the share holder is not required to do anything. In all the cases cited above the shareholder is just a passive beneficiary of these actions. There is nothing the share holder has to do or does in a Mandatory Corporate Action.|$|R

It was followed by a passionate talk by a local shabiba (Fatah youth) promising that this was the first step towards reclaiming all of <b>Mandatory</b> Palestine, <b>words</b> that elicited a more enthusiastic response. Musallam had been chosen to close the rally, and his stirring delivery was, according to a foreign observer, interrupted after every sentence with cries of al-Ab Manuel! al-Ab Manuel (Father Manuel!).

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Aims. Cosmic shear, {{the distortion}} {{of images of}} distant sources by the tidal gravitational field of the large-scale matter distribution in the Universe, {{is one of the}} most powerful cosmological probes. The measured shear field may be due not only to the gravitational lensing effect, but may contain systematic effects from the measurement process or intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes. One of the main probes for these systematics are the division of the shear field into E- and B-mode shear, where lensing only produces the former. As shown in a recent note, all currently used E-/B-mode separation methods for the shear correlation functions ξ ± require them to be measured to arbitrarily small and/or large separations which is of course not feasible in practice. Methods. We derive second-order shear statistics which provide a clean separation into E- and B-modes from measurements of ξ±(ϑ) over a finite interval only. We call these new statistics the circle and ring statistics, respectively; the latter is obtained by an integral over the former. The mathematical properties of these new shear statistics are obtained, as well as specific expressions for applying them to observed data. Results. It is shown that an E-/B-mode separation can be performed on measurements of ξ ± over a finite interval in angular separation, using the ring statistics. We furthermore generalize this result to derive the most general class of second-order shear statistics which provide a separation of E- and B-mode shear on a given angular interval ϑmin ≤ ϑ≤ϑmax. In view of these generalization, we discuss the aperture dispersion and the shear dispersion and their relation to the shear correlation functions. Our results will be of practical use particularly for future cosmic shear surveys where highly precise measurements of the shear will become available and where control of systematics will be <b>mandatory.</b> Key <b>words.</b> cosmology – gravitational lensing – large-scale structure of the Univers...|$|R
40|$|Event-related brain {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{were recorded}} as subjects silently read {{a set of}} unrelated sentences. The ERP responses elicited by open-classwords were sorted according to word frequency and the ordinal position of the eliciting word within its sentence. We observed a strong inverse correlation between sentence position and the amplitude of the N 400 component of the ERP. In addition, we found that less frequent words were associated with larger N 400 s than were more frequent words, {{but only if the}} eliciting words occurred early in their respective sentences. We take this interaction between sentence position and word frequency as evidence that frequency does not play a <b>mandatory</b> role in <b>word</b> recognition, but can be superseded by the contextual constraint provided by a sentence. The frequency of a word's occurrence in common usage and the relationship of a word to prior context have proven to be two of the most powerful determinants of performance in experimental studies of word recognition. In the laboratory, subjects typically require either more time or more information to respond to rare words than they do to respond to common words (e. g., Rubinstein, Garfield, & Millikan, 1970; Solomon & Howes, 1951). Similarly, subjects are faster or more accurate to respond to words that are congruent with the preceding context (Fischle...|$|R
40|$|The IASB is {{presently}} {{involved in a}} project on reporting comprehensive income. Since the IASB accounting system {{is a mixture of}} two income determination methods, to wit historical cost accounting and fair value accounting, an interesting question pertains to whether the display of comprehensive income should be neutral with regard to these two competing paradigms. This paper scrutinizes, with a valuation perspective in mind, the typical arguments made by proponents of historical cost net income and comprehensive fair value income and finds that claims for exclusive reliance on a single concept of earnings are untenable. This means that a case could be made for advancing neutral income display as a policy objective. The matrix format of comprehensive income that is proposed under the IASB performance project certainly allows for such a neutral interpretation. However, given the importance of summarization in financial analysis, as is most extremely reflected in the focus on the earnings per share (EPS) number, if neutrality is to prevail, then it should also be reflected at the highest level of summarization of financial performance reporting. In other <b>words,</b> <b>mandatory</b> publication of two EPS numbers, one for net income and one for comprehensive income, should be considered. Possible effects on perception and actual use of financial reports that should enter such a consideration are suggested as topics for experimental research.

40|$|Context. We present work on Hα {{spectral}} line characteristics in PHOENIX stellar model atmospheres and their comparison to microlensing observations. Aims. We examine {{in detail the}} Hα equivalent width (EW) and the line shape characteristics for effective temperatures of 4500 K< Teff< 5600 K where Hα is a strong spectral feature. Methods. We find that Hα EW in models calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is up to 15 % smaller than in models without this assumption, non-LTE models (NLTE) and that line shapes vary significantly for the two model types. A comparison with available high quality microlensing data, capable of tracing Hα absorption {{across the face of}} one G 5 III giant, shows that the LTE model that fits the EW best is about 100 K hotter than and the best-fitting NLTE model has a similar Teff as predicted by the spectral type analysis of the observed star but agree within the uncertainties of the observationally derived temperature. Results. Neither LTE nor NLTE models fit the line shape well. We suspect unmodelled chromospheric emission. Line shape diagnostics suggest lower gravities than derived for the star and are unacceptable low {{in the case of the}} LTE models. We show that EW alone is insufficient for comparison to stellar model atmospheres, but combined with a new shape parameter we define is promising. In stellar parameter ranges where the Hα line is strong, a NLTE approach of modeling stellar atmospheres is not only beneficial but <b>mandatory.</b> Conclusions.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{potentialities}} of SAR Tomography to infer information about the vertical structure of forested areas, basing on the availability of either multi-polarimetric or single-polarimetric data. The core of the analysis is represented by a model of the second order statistics of the multi-baseline, multi-polarimetric data that describes the imaged scene as the superposition of two distributed scattering mechanisms. In this framework, the well posing of the Tomographic problem can be discussed in a simple fashion, by considering the number of equations that arise from the data-set with respect to the number of the unknowns required to solve the model. As a result, it follows that through the exploitation of strongly structured models the vertical structure can be retrieved basing on single-polarimetric data as well, provided that a sufficient number of baselines is available. Still, the availability of multi-polarimetric and multi-baseline data offers the possibility to face the problem of the retrieval of the vertical structure of each scattering mechanism from a very general point of view, allowing to relax many of the assumptions that are otherwise <b>mandatory.</b> In other <b>words,</b> the availability of multipolarimetric data makes it possible to exploit not only model based approaches, but also model free, and hybrid approaches. As a result of this analysis, a new general methodology will be presented for the processing of multi-polarimetric and multibaseline data, that is consistent the inversion procedures usually exploited in single-baseline PolInSAR in the case where only single baseline data are available. Experimental results will be shown basing on a data-set of 9 P-Band SAR images of the forest site of Remningstorp, Sweden, acquired under the framework of the ESA campaign BioSAR 2007...|$|R
