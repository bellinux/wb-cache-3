5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact {{has been on the}} middle-class blacks, given that <b>most</b> <b>black</b> professionals are older and more advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.|$|E
5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, <b>most</b> <b>black</b> voters in the South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male voters were exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} from Haiti, Brown moved to Alabama in 1937 {{and worked at}} the Tuskegee Institute as a history teacher until 1940. In 1940, she joined LeMoyne-Owen College as a history teacher after a move from Alabama to Memphis, Tennessee. She {{continued}} teaching at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1945. Brown faced the same problem as <b>most</b> <b>black</b> educators during that era, in that they were offered appointments to teaching positions in higher education only in historically African American universities and colleges. She returned briefly in 1945 to Ohio State University to take additional classes in Eastern history and geography.|$|E
50|$|In 1890 {{the state}} {{legislature}} disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> under the new constitution, which used poll taxes and literacy tests to raise barriers to voter registration. Many people left the rural county for cities to gain other opportunities. <b>Most</b> <b>blacks</b> could not vote in Mississippi until the late 1960s, after passage of federal legislation.|$|R
50|$|Blacks {{were still}} elected to local offices {{throughout}} the 1880s, but their voting was suppressed {{for state and}} national elections. Democrats passed laws to make voter registration and electoral rules more restrictive, {{with the result that}} political participation by <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and many poor whites began to decrease. Between 1890 and 1910, ten of the eleven former Confederate states, starting with Mississippi, passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> {{and tens of thousands of}} poor whites through a combination of poll taxes, literacy and comprehension tests, and residency and record-keeping requirements. Grandfather clauses temporarily permitted some illiterate whites to vote but gave no relief to <b>most</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1960, Englewood had 67,216 {{black people}} and 51,583 white people; black people made up about 69% of the {{residents}} in Englewood. At the time <b>most</b> <b>black</b> people resided around 63rd Street. At the time the median income of Englewood was $5,579 ($ according to inflation).|$|E
25|$|With Phillips County {{developed}} for cotton plantations in the antebellum era, its population was overwhelmingly black and descended from slaves: in Phillips County, African-Americans outnumbered whites by a ten-to-one ratio. In the Arkansas Delta {{around the time}} of the Great War, <b>most</b> <b>black</b> farmers were sharecroppers and illiterate, as were many poor whites.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Duchamp {{teamed with}} chess theorist Vitaly Halberstadt to publish L'opposition et cases conjuguées sont réconciliées (Opposition and Sister Squares are Reconciled), known as {{corresponding}} squares. This treatise describes the Lasker-Reichhelm position, an extremely rare type of position that can {{arise in the}} endgame. Using enneagram-like charts that fold upon themselves, the authors demonstrated that in this position, the <b>most</b> <b>Black</b> {{can hope for is}} a draw.|$|E
5000|$|... 1890 - Mississippi {{passes a}} new {{constitution}} that effectively disfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> (poll taxes, residency and literacy tests).|$|R
50|$|Note: Mississippi {{had passed}} a new {{constitution}} in 1890 that effectively disfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> by changing electoral and voter registration requirements; although it deprived them of constitutional rights authorized under post-Civil War amendments, it survived US Supreme Court challenges at the time. It was not until after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> in Mississippi and other southern states gained federal protection to enforce the constitutional right of citizens to vote.|$|R
50|$|The near {{exclusion}} of <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> {{from the political}} system lasted for decades until after Congressional passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.|$|R
25|$|With their {{tailored}} {{suits and}} detailed choreography, the Temptations set the bar high for male soul and R {{groups of the}} period. Before the Temptations became popular, <b>most</b> <b>black</b> vocal groups were rough, high-energy acts featuring vocals that were more raw and dance movements that were more improvisational. Only a few performers, including contemporaries Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, and the Four Tops, showed the refined style that would be popularized by the Temptations.|$|E
25|$|Fisk's {{students}} and many progressive alumni resented the school's outreach to White Nashvillians and strict {{code of conduct}}. While Fisk's strict code of conduct and discipline and role as loco parentis was mirrored by <b>most</b> <b>Black</b> colleges and White universities, including nearby Vanderbilt, the approach collided with the New Negro spirit of Black determination. Dissatisfaction also extended to prohibition of Greek societies on campus, although student interest in social organizations predated McKenzie's arrival.|$|E
25|$|Since Black Flag's break-up, Rollins has had {{the most}} visible public profile as a musician, writer, and actor. <b>Most</b> <b>Black</b> Flag members have also {{remained}} active in music, especially Ginn, who continued playing with bands such as Gone, October Faction, and Screw Radio, and Stevenson, who continued on with the Descendents, All, Only Crime, and the reformed Lemonheads. Kira Roessler continues to record and perform with the band DOS, a duet with then-husband and Minutemen bassist Mike Watt.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{exclusion}} from the U.S. Army, <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> either {{served in the}} U.S. Navy or defected to the British Navy to gain their freedom.|$|R
50|$|In 1895 white Democrats in {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a new constitution, disfranchising <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> for more than 60 years by raising barriers to voter registration.|$|R
50|$|William McClaughry was one {{of three}} ex-slaves who {{achieved}} the impossible dream of becoming upstate land barons during the post-Revolutionary War period, when <b>most</b> <b>Blacks</b> were still in shackles.|$|R
25|$|Black preachers {{provided}} leadership, encouraged {{education and}} economic growth, and were often the primary {{link between the}} black and white communities. The black church established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For <b>most</b> <b>black</b> leaders, the churches always were connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be a tension between black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.|$|E
25|$|The NAACP {{began to}} lead {{lawsuits}} targeting disfranchisement and racial segregation early in its history. It {{played a significant}} part in the challenge of Guinn v. United States (1915) to Oklahoma's discriminatory grandfather clause, which effectively disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>black</b> citizens while exempting many whites from certain voter registration requirements. It persuaded the Supreme Court of the United States to rule in Buchanan v. Warley in 1917 that {{state and local governments}} cannot officially segregate African Americans into separate residential districts. The Court's opinion reflected the jurisprudence of property rights and freedom of contract as embodied in the earlier precedent it established in Lochner v. New York.|$|E
25|$|After Reconstruction through 1900, St. Louis {{saw little}} of the racial {{violence}} that engulfed Southern states, due to the stability and relatively small size of the St. Louis black community. <b>Most</b> <b>black</b> residents lived in the northern edges of downtown along the riverfront or {{in the area of}} Chestnut Valley and Mill Creek Valley, near the wharf and railroads for employment. Municipal segregation laws (known as Jim Crow laws) were relatively inconsistent; while blacks could not enter white hotels, restaurants or barber shops, they could enter department store elevators with whites or attend St. Louis theater shows in separate sections. Streetcar seating also was integrated, and there were no efforts to enforce residential segregation prior to 1911.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the new}} {{provisions}} {{held that}} any person registered before January 1, 1903, as most whites were, would thereafter be registered for life. That was a type of grandfather clause. Any person not registered at that time, as <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> were not, would have to satisfy a number of requirements before being allowed to register. They included {{a test of the}} potential registrant's understanding of the duties and obligations of citizenship. This test was administered by white election officials, who conducted it in a subjective manner that resulted in most whites' being approved to register and <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> being rejected.|$|R
5000|$|The massacre, and passage {{by white}} Democrats of discriminatory state legislation, {{including}} disenfranchisement of <b>most</b> <b>blacks,</b> ended organizing of sugar workers until the 1940s. [...] "The defeated sugar workers {{returned to the}} plantations on their employers' terms." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{not legally}} barred from owning land, <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> were {{practically}} barred from owning land through suppressive economic practices. [...] Their survival thus continued to rely {{a great deal}} on the whims of the white land owning class.|$|R
25|$|In 1899 {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a new constitution, with requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests for voter registration which disfranchised <b>most</b> <b>black</b> Americans in the state. Exclusion from voting had wide effects: it meant that black Americans could not serve on juries or in any local office. After a decade of white supremacy, many people forgot that North Carolina had ever had thriving middle-class black Americans. Black citizens had no political voice in the state until after the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed to enforce their constitutional rights. It was not until 1992 that another African American was elected as a US Representative from North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Following the World War II, {{gospel music}} moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. In 1950, black gospel was {{featured}} at Carnegie Hall when Joe Bostic produced the Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival. He repeated {{it the next}} year with an expanded list of performing artists, and in 1959 moved to Madison Square Garden. Today, black gospel and white gospel are distinct genres, with distinct audiences. In white gospel, {{there is a large}} Gospel Music Association and a Gospel Music Hall of Fame, which includes a few black artists, such as Mahalia Jackson, but which ignores <b>most</b> <b>black</b> artists. In the black community, James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America in 1969.|$|E
25|$|With {{the reverse}} {{movement}} of the New Great Migration, the South has been the gaining region for black migrants coming from all three other census regions, especially from 1995 to 2000. The chief gaining states have been Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee. In the same period, Georgia, Texas and Maryland attracted the <b>most</b> <b>black</b> college graduates. Houston and Dallas center cities have lost black population as the middle class has moved to the suburbs. In a change from previous settlement patterns, new regional migrants settle directly in the suburbs, the areas of largest residential growth and often the location of jobs as well. In addition to Atlanta, the top metropolitan areas attracting African Americans include Orlando, Jacksonville and Tallahassee, Florida; and Charlotte, North Carolina.|$|E
50|$|In 1819, Alabama was {{admitted}} as the 22nd {{state to the}} Union. Its constitution provided for equal suffrage for white men, a standard it abandoned in its constitution of 1901, which reduced suffrage of poor whites and <b>most</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rideau’s {{trials and}} {{convictions}} split the Lake Charles, Louisiana, community {{along racial lines}} for four decades. In the fourth and final trial in 2005, most white spectators sat behind the prosecutor’s table and <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> sat behind the defense.|$|R
5000|$|In 1890 Mississippi {{adopted a}} new constitution, which {{contained}} provisions for voter registration which required voters pay poll taxes and pass a literacy test. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, {{and the two}} provisions effectively disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a Supreme Court challenge in Williams v. Mississippi (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and {{what they called the}} [...] "Mississippi plan." [...] By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill. Such constitutional provisions were unsuccessfully challenged at the Supreme Court in Giles v. Harris (1903). In practice, these provisions, including white primaries, created a maze that blocked <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and many poor whites from voting in Southern states until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. Voter registration and turnout dropped sharply across the South, as <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and many poor whites were excluded from the political system.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, they began to make voter {{registration}} more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>black</b> voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They {{had no one to}} represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, {{the north side of}} East Palo Alto became a military training ground, of which only the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Menlo Park still exists. In the 1940s, East Palo Alto was a farming community with many Japanese residents. During the war, the Japanese were forced out, many to relocation centers, and did not return after the war. In the 1950s the farms were built over with cheap housing and many African-American families moved in. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s there was a renewed interest in African history, one expression of which was a fad for Swahili. In 1968 the area was almost renamed Nairobi, after the center of the Swahili-speaking area, to reflect the population's African roots. Critics of the change pointed out that Nairobi was the capital of Kenya, in East Africa, and {{had little to do with}} the cultural roots of <b>most</b> <b>black</b> Americans. In the end, the change was not made.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that <b>most</b> <b>black</b> people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
500|$|Southern white conservatives, calling {{themselves}} [...] "Redeemers" [...] took control {{after the end}} of Reconstruction. By the 1890–1910 period Jim Crow laws disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and some poor whites. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South. Racial minorities occasionally experienced vigilante violence.|$|R
25|$|Lowndes County, in the Black Belt, {{had been}} an area of large cotton {{plantations}} before the Civil War. Devoted to agriculture, in 1890 the county had the highest proportion of Negroes to whites of any in Alabama. <b>Most</b> <b>blacks</b> worked as sharecroppers cultivating cotton.|$|R
5000|$|The white Democratic-dominated {{legislature}} {{passed an}} election law in 1891 and poll tax {{amendment to the}} state constitution in 1892 that effectively disenfranchised <b>most</b> <b>blacks</b> and many poor whites in the state. They followed that by passing and imposing Jim Crow laws for racial segregation.|$|R
