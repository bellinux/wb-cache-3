50|$|Load {{transfer}} is {{of critical importance}} for vehicle stability in vehicles such as SUVs. Ideally in high performance applications load transfer tends to be minimized as a tire's performance is directly affected {{by the amount of}} load that it has to transmit. In a steady state turn the final load transfer, summed across all the axles, is only related to the position of the center of mass above the ground, the track width and the lateral acceleration. SUVs must shift their center of mass lower, widen their wheel track, or decrease their lateral acceleration to avoid tipping. To keep them from tipping many auto manufacturers use tires with lower grip to reduce the vehicles cornering capacity, or the roll stiffness balance front to rear can be altered to encourage understeer or oversteer as necessary to limit the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the vehicle.|$|E

In addition to those specified on the vehicle identification placard, four other front/rear tire inflation pressure combinations were used. Multiple loading configurations were used: Nominal Load, 5 -Occupant, 10 -Occupant, and Maximum Occupancy. Not all loading configurations were used for each test. The tests performed in this study were performed in three groups. Handling in the linear range, at or near <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and dynamic rollover resistance at the various inflation pressure combinations were evaluated. The linear range handling measures and maximum lateral accelerations seen in this study showed measurable changes due to variations in tire inflation pressure. However, these small changes are believed not to be of practical significance. This is, of course, good since a high sensitivity to tire inflation pressure changes could cause in-use problems.

This thesis investigates how curve geometry influences the driver behavior in horizontal curves by using naturalistic driving data. Seven curves were selected, all on rural two-lane roads with a posted speed limit of 70 km/h. The curve geometry factors studied were radius, presence and lengths of spiral transitions and lengths of approach and exit tangent.

40|$|The {{stability}} and yaw control systems in today's vehicles are increasingly appreciated for active safety. They use individual wheel braking {{to obtain an}} extra yaw moment. Adding individual traction, e. g. through electric wheel motors, would increase the available extra yaw moment. The present work investigates the manoeuvrability potential of such a concept. A passenger car employing electric wheel motors at the rear axle is {{compared with the same}} vehicle using only brake intervention. The potential, or ultimate limits, are investigated for two driving situations. The time delay in yaw speed change when entering a curve is estimated.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} with multiple motors permit continuous direct yaw moment control, also called torque-vectoring. This allows to significantly enhance the cornering response, e. g., by extending the linear {{region of the}} vehicle understeer characteristic, and by increasing the <b>maximum</b> achievable <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration.</b> These benefits are well documented for human-driven cars, yet limited information is available for autonomous/driverless vehicles. In particular, {{over the last few}} years, steering controllers for automated driving at the cornering limit have considerably advanced, but it is unclear how these controllers should be integrated alongside a torque-vectoring system. This contribution discusses the integration of torque-vectoring control and automated driving, including the design and implementation of the torque-vectoring controller of an autonomous electric vehicle for a novel racing competition. The paper presents the main vehicle characteristics and control architecture. A quasi-static model is introduced to predict the understeer characteristics at different longitudinal accelerations. The model is coupled with an off-line optimization for the a-priori investigation of the potential benefits of torque-vectoring. The systematic computation of the achievable cornering limits is used to specify and design realistic maps of the reference yaw rate, and a non-linear feedforward yaw moment contribution providing the reference cornering response in quasi-static conditions.

40|$|Each {{year there}} are several {{thousand}} reported cases of vehicles rolling over in the United States, with 80 % of all fatal accidents involving rollover in Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs), trucks or vans. Cases involving occupants being thrown out from the vehicle during rollover can be up to 10 {{times more likely to}} sustain serious injury or death. Determining whether a vehicle will roll over before the event occurs provides advanced warning and the ability to apply active and/or passive safety countermeasures. The objective of rollover mitigation systems {{can be viewed as a}} two-part problem: prediction and prevention. Prediction requires a vehicle model that captures the key dynamics during a rollover event. We present a vehicle rollover prediction algorithm that gives the current state as well as future states, allowing the system to determine if the conditions necessary for rollover will be achieved before the conditions are measured by the sensors, increasing lead time to perform preventative countermeasures. ^ We develop a control strategy to prevent rollover utilizing fully active suspension to generate a roll prevention torque on the vehicle. The proposed control law applies a torque to the sprung mass such that the left and right side vertical loads are driven to the nominal load values (under zero <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration).</b> We consider actuation rate and magnitude limits for such systems based on existing hardware and implement the control on a simulation model in CarSim. Using simulation we demonstrate the prevention of rollover in both the flick turn and fishhook turn maneuvers subject to the actuation constraints. It is shown that this control strategy is able to increase the <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> limitation before rollover is achieved, verified on highly dynamic maneuvers where the lateral load transfer is maximized. ^ Our goal is to achieve improved roll prevention without requiring the system to be constantly active as such approach has negative effects on the efficiency of the vehicle overall. We show in simulation results that activation of the controller only once liftoff has been predicted increases the <b>maximum</b> sustained <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> that the vehicle can encounter without rolling over. It is shown with realistic actuation torque limitations that such system can reduce the risk of rollover for highly dynamic steering inputs that maximize lateral load transfer. ...|$|R

These systems have evolved from anti-lock braking and traction control systems, to electronic stability control. Recent developments include active steering, suspension, and – {{of interest in this}} work – computer controlled drive force distribution. These systems are known to have the potential improve a vehicle’s handling, defined as the relationship between driver input and vehicle output, over a wide range of operating conditions. The focus of past and present research in this field has been on the interaction between combined lateral and longitudinal forces on a tire level. Nonetheless, the influence of the drive force and drive force distribution on vehicle level handling characteristics – of interest for this work – have been unsatisfactory described in the reviewed literature. Based on this fact, and the relevance of this needed knowledge for this study, these shortcomings are being addressed in this work.

The goal of this research project {{is to develop a}} robot equipped with these two skills. All aspects of the robot being a mechatronic system are covered, including an omnidirectional propulsion system, an omnidirectional vision system, and a simple ball handling mechanism for dribbling a soccer ball.

A robust trajectory planning algorithm based on a global coordinate system is developed. It computes a robot trajectory surrounding a set of control points in given orientations, accounting for the interaction between robot and ball. A controller closes the feedback loop from sensors to actuators keeping the robot on its predetermined course. An experimental validation examines sensor accuracy, performance of actuators and controllers, and the overall skill to dribble a ball along a given trajectory.

The regulations in the National Road Traffic Act of South Africa that govern heavy vehicle design do not directly address the roll stability of heavy vehicles. The internationally accepted method of regulating roll stability is by means of a static rollover threshold (SRT) assessment or test, to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> that a vehicle can withstand before rolling over. The SRT is determined by physical testing, or through multibody dynamics simulation; however, both of these approaches are costly and time-consuming.

If the airplane does not turn or yaw immediately after landing, it probably will trim up and then make a smooth run or porpoise slightly. The maximum longitudinal decelerations that will be encountered are about 6 g or 7 g. 4. Although the decelerations are not indicated to be especially large, the construction of the airplane is such that extensive damage is to be expected, and it probably will be difficult to find ditching stations where crew members can adequately brace themselves and be reasonably sure of avoiding a large inrush of water...|$|E
40|$|Previously, limit {{steady state}} {{handling}} {{has always been}} restricted to the qualitative statement that a vehicle has final understeer or final oversteer; it cannot be analysed by the conventional understeer gradient concept. A specific proposal is made for quantification offinal understeer or oversteer. This is called the understeer number, and is defned by Nu = (AJA,) - 1, where A, and A, are the lateral acceleration capabilities of thefront and rear axles. Thus Nu is non-dimensional, is zero for a notiona 1 ji;lal neutral vehicle, positive forfnal understeer and negative forfinal oversteer. A typical value is 0. 150 (rear drive) or 0. 220 (front). The various design parameters that influence the understeer number are investigated, and equations are obtained and quantified, including centre of mass position, lateral load transfer distribution, longitudinal load transfer, traction, the components of aerodynamic forces and moments, the effect of non-free differentials {{and the effect of}} load increments. The effect of turning radius and slopes is also investigated. Thus the limit state of handling is subject to a quantitative assessment, showing the degree of a vehicle's commitment tofinal understeer or oversteer.

40|$|There are {{few studies}} in the {{literature}} that relate subjective ratings to objective measures of low frequency <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> such as might be experienced whist cornering in a car. This paper reports a study where 1203 subjects drove two different cars (‘sport’ and ‘comfort’) on two different <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> trials. Objective measures of acceleration were taken, in addition to ratings of <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> intensity and confidence. It is shown {{that there was little}} difference between the peak <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> experienced in the two cars, although males chose to drive with greater <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> (i. e. at higher speed) than the females. Despite differences between the objective measures of acceleration being small, subjective data showed that the intensity of acceleration was rated higher for the comfort car than the sport car indicating that subjective ratings are context specific. Ratings of intensity were correlated with measures of peak acceleration for each car / trial combination. Drivers were more confident driving the sport car than the comfort car on the two trials. However, there was only a weak and inconsistent relationship between <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> and driving confidence. It is hypothesised that {{this is an example of}} risk homeostasis whereby drivers choose to moderate their speed (and therefore the <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration)</b> in response to their confidence level that might be affected by a complex combination of factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a {{suspension}} that would improve {{the performance of the}} Cal Poly SAE Formula Electric car around a racing track Performance would be quantified through skidpad, slalom, and straight-line acceleration tests as well as autocross lap times. The approach to meeting the objective was to increase the steady-state <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> and quicken the transient response while maintaining predictable handling so that the driver could extract maximum performance from the car. The car uses round-section (motorcycle) tires at a large negative camber angle because the lateral force generated by a pair of negatively-cambered tires increases with lateral load transfer, which is opposite of the behavior of normal car tires. According to research, <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> grip is achieved at a high-negative camber angle (- 40 degrees) but best longitudinal acceleration is had with no camber. The original design for the suspension was a passive, dynamic camber system which varied the camber in order to provide maximum grip in a straight line as well as in turns. The scale of this design was deemed to be too large for the time, resources, and manufacturing skill of the Formula Electric team this year. Therefore it was decided to produce a highly adjustable static camber suspension that could be tuned best performance as well as adjusted to allow for testing of the dynamic camber concept. The final design is a static camber system using the “five link” suspension configuration in both front and rear. The links have turnbuckle adjustment and are easy to manufacture so that many camber angles can be tried in order to find the optimal camber angle for a particular track. The uprights are of shell construction and the rear uprights can be used at any camber angle. The front requires a slightly different upright geometry for very large camber angles than for small camber angles. Tires are sized 100 / 85 -R 10 on all four corners and are meant for small racing motorcycles. They are lightweight and allow large camber angles to be used. Component testing and validation consisted of Instron testing for link buckling, link thread pullout, link tensile strength, and rod end buckling. Testing on the suspension as a whole will involve skidpad tests to find the <b>maximum</b> steady state <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> from various camber configurations as well as acceleration tests to find the effect of camber on longitudinal acceleration. The goal will be to find the best static camber setup and determine if a dynamic camber system, active or passive, would actually provide a significant advantage if the manufacturing resources were available to build it...|$|R
