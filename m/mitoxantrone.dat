5|$|<b>Mitoxantrone</b> is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{also used}} in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals {{in the case of}} natalizumab and every three months in the case of <b>mitoxantrone.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Mitoxantrone</b> therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that <b>mitoxantrone</b> be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|Natalizumab and <b>mitoxantrone</b> are {{considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, <b>mitoxantrone</b> is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from <b>mitoxantrone,</b> and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. <b>Mitoxantrone,</b> whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} antibiotics are {{a varied}} group {{of drugs that}} have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication is that they interrupt cell division. The most important subgroup is the anthracyclines and the bleomycins; other prominent examples include mitomycin C, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> and actinomycin.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{docetaxel}} increasing {{survival time}} {{in people with}} certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from docetaxel, however {{it is difficult to}} attribute these findings directly to treatment with docetaxel. Improved median survival time and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to disease-free survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with docetaxel has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with <b>mitoxantrone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, doxorubicin, <b>mitoxantrone</b> and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3â€“6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), <b>mitoxantrone</b> and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.|$|E
500|$|... {{only one}} medication, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> has been {{approved}} for secondary progressive MS. In this population tentative evidence supports <b>mitoxantrone</b> moderately slowing the progression {{of the disease and}} decreasing rates of relapses over two years.|$|E
500|$|Medications {{approved}} by the FDA include currently eleven medications: interferons beta-1a and [...] beta-1b, four monoclonal antibodies: natalizumab, alemtuzumab, daclizumab and ocrelizumab, and five immunomodulators: glatiramer acetate, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> [...] fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate.|$|E
500|$|<b>Mitoxantrone</b> {{has shown}} {{positive}} effects {{in people with}} a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression {{of the disease and}} the frequency of relapses in people after two years. In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing [...] MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.|$|E
500|$|Medications are {{modestly}} {{effective at}} decreasing {{the number of}} attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. [...] One of the factors related to non-respondance {{is the presence of}} high levels of interferon beta neutralizing [...] antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of [...] neutralizing [...] antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called [...] "rapidly worsening MS" [...] are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either <b>mitoxantrone</b> or natalizumab.|$|E
2500|$|The ABCG2 gene was {{discovered}} in cell lines selected for high level resistance for <b>mitoxantrone</b> and no expression of ABCB1 or ABCC1. ABCG2 can export anthrocycline anticancer drugs, as well as topotecan, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> or doxorubicin as substrates. Chromosomal translocations {{have been found to}} cause the ABCG2 amplification or rearrangement found in resistant cell lines. [...] The normal function of ABCG2 is not known.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|No {{controlled}} {{trials have}} established {{the effectiveness of}} treatments {{for the prevention of}} attacks. Many clinicians agree that [...] long term immunosuppression is required to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks, while others argue the exact opposite. [...] Commonly used immunosuppressant treatments include azathioprine (Imuran) plus prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil plus prednisone, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide.|$|E
2500|$|Among the anthracyclines, {{doxorubicin}} and daunorubicin {{were the}} first, and {{were obtained from}} the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. [...] Derivatives of these compounds include epirubicin and idarubicin. Other clinically used drugs in the anthracyline group are pirarubicin, aclarubicin, and <b>mitoxantrone.</b> The mechanisms of anthracyclines include DNA intercalation (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive free radicals that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.|$|E
2500|$|Complete cure is rare with {{lymphoma}} {{and treatment}} {{tends to be}} palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. [...] With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. [...] Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish. [...] Average survival is 9 to 12 months. [...] The most common treatment {{is a combination of}} cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. [...] Other chemotherapy drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and <b>mitoxantrone</b> are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. [...] In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored.|$|E
2500|$|Palliative {{care for}} {{advanced}} stage prostate cancer focuses on extending life and relieving {{the symptoms of}} metastatic disease. As noted above, abiraterone is showing some promise in treating advance-stage prostate cancer. [...] It causes a dramatic reduction in PSA levels and tumor sizes in aggressive advanced-stage prostate cancer for 70% of patients. [...] Chemotherapy may be offered to slow disease progression and postpone symptoms. The most commonly used regimen combines the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel with a corticosteroid such as prednisone. One study showed that treatment with docetaxel with prednisone prolonged life from 16.5 months for those taking <b>mitoxantrone</b> and prednisone to 18.9 months for those taking docetaxel + prednisone. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid {{have been shown to}} delay skeletal complications such as fractures or the need for radiation therapy in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Xofigo is a new alpha emitting pharmaceutical targeting bone metastasis. The phase II testing shows prolonged patient survival times, reduced pain, and improved quality of life.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mitoxantrone</b> & Copaxone: A {{recent study}} in the United Kingdom {{revealed}} interesting results when {{using a combination of}} <b>mitoxantrone</b> and copaxone. In an open-label study of 27 patients with RRMS, the results suggested a rapid and sustained suppression of relapses. A three-year controlled study of 60 patients is now being launched at 10 centres across the UK. In another clinical trial, glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has been combined with <b>Mitoxantrone</b> {{in such a way that}} every course of <b>Mitoxantrone</b> is followed by GA treatment. It has yielded promising results twice, in a consistent way.|$|E
50|$|MITO-FLAG (also called Mito-FLAG, FLAG-MITO, or FLAG-Mito) adds <b>mitoxantrone</b> to the {{standard}} regimen. <b>Mitoxantrone</b> is a synthetic anthracycline analogue (an anthracenedione) that, like idarubicin, can intercalate DNA and prevent cell division.|$|E
5000|$|... {{only one}} medication, <b>mitoxantrone,</b> has been {{approved}} for secondary progressive MS. In this population tentative evidence supports <b>mitoxantrone</b> moderately slowing the progression {{of the disease and}} decreasing rates of relapses over two years.|$|E
50|$|Pixantrone: pixantrone (BBR2778) is an {{analogue}} of <b>mitoxantrone</b> {{devoid of}} toxic effects on cardiac tissue. It is as potent as <b>mitoxantrone</b> in animal models of MS; however results of human trials {{had not been}} published in 2007.|$|E
50|$|In a phase III {{trial with}} 755 {{men for the}} {{treatment}} of castration-resistant prostate cancer, median survival was 15.1 months for patients receiving cabazitaxel versus 12.7 months for patients receiving <b>mitoxantrone.</b> Cabazitaxel was associated with more grade 3-4 neutropenia (81.7%) than <b>mitoxantrone</b> (58%).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of <b>mitoxantrone</b> and prednisone is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Until recently this combination {{was the first}} line of treatment; however, a {{combination of}} docetaxel and prednisone improves survival rates and lengthens the disease-free period. <b>Mitoxantrone</b> is also used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), most notably the subset of the disease known as secondary-progressive MS. Absent a cure <b>mitoxantrone</b> is effective in slowing the progression of secondary-progressive MS and extending the time between relapses in both relapsing-remitting MS and progressive-relapsing MS.|$|E
