5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and <b>military</b> <b>compass</b> suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E

[...] The U.S. M-1950 equipped with self-luminous lighting contains 120 mCi (millicuries) of tritium. The purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide illumination for the compass, via radioluminescent tritium illumination, which {{does not require the}} compass to be [...] "recharged" [...] by sunlight or artificial light. However, tritium has a half-life of only about 12 years, so a compass that contains 120mCi of tritium when new will contain only 60 when it is 12 years old, 30 when it is 24 years old, and so on. Consequently, the illumination of the display will fade.|$|R

50|$|Pelayo was a Galician nobleman of {{middling}} rank, a great-nephew of Count Pedro Fróilaz de Traba.

He may also have helped start the monastery at nearby Oia, but the large number of forged documents make disentangling this monastery's early history difficult. In 1148 he donated his part of the church at Franza to the monastery of Xuvia, partially as payment for some livestock. With the help of his brother Suero, he tried to restore the monastery of Barrantes in 1151. On 31 August 1152, Pelayo was at the royal court, where he employed a royal scribe to write up a donation of land at Pesegueiro to two brothers, Pedro and Lucio, who promised in return to render annually two solidi to the canons of Tui.

40|$|What {{role has}} {{technology}} served {{in shaping the}} U. S. professional military ethic and its attitudes toward collateral damage and {{the sanctity of the}} noncombatant? Earlier research has examined the military 2 ̆ 7 s ethic, the role of technology in military operations, and the roots of noncombatant immunity. The interrelationship of all three subjects has not enjoyed similar investigations. A nation 2 ̆ 7 s military has an ethic that is inherently related to the values of the society that it serves. In the United States, the <b>military</b> moral <b>compass</b> is contained in a professional military ethic that has been shaped and continues to evolve from multiple influences. The sway of the just war tradition and the discourses of Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill offer perspectives on ethical obligations to place rational and compassionate limits on war making. The unique stimuli, however, of a democratic nation with its own historical experiences and values, contribute to the formation of a moral framework that is distinctive from those of other national military organizations. One ethical-shaping influence experienced by both society and its armed forces, and cautioned by the French philosopher Jacques Ellul and the cultural critic Neil Postman, is technology. This study assesses the professional military ethic and the factors that have influenced its appraisal of collateral damage and the sanctity of the noncombatant. Critical to this examination are the consideration of technology 2 ̆ 7 s multifaceted influence upon individual Service ideologies and their relationship to collateral damage from the Civil War to the War on Terror. This study concludes with an assessment of the external and internal influences that offer a hope to the mitigation of technology 2 ̆ 7 s risks to the noncombatant. ...|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs societies {{of the developed}} {{part of the world}} evolved, new trends of military staffing have been coming up. The basic trend that used to exist globally till the end of WW-II was the conscription system, through which all citizens were obliged to serve. During the 20 th century, when globalization became the new world concept, when terrorist attacks devaluated armies, when people became wealthier and more independent; military staffing, as an issue closely related to the society, was also affected. The new trend nowadays is towards the All Volunteer Force. The present military conscription system of Greece is constituted by two types of soldiers: the draft soldiers and the volunteers. The recent trend in the same country is towards the All Volunteer Force.

Public language, I shall argue, is just such a tool [...] it is a species of external artifact whose current adaptive value is partially constituted by its role in re-shaping the kinds of computational space that our biological brains must negotiate in order to solve certain types of problems, or to carry out certain complex projects. This computational role of language has been somewhat neglected (not un-noticed, but not rigorously pursued either) in recent cognitive science, due perhaps to a (quite proper) fascination with and concentration upon, that other obvious dimension: the role of language as an instrument of interpersonal communication. Work on sentence parsing, language use and story understanding has thus concentrated on the role of language in processes of information transfer between agents and on information retrieval from texts. But it has had little to say about the computational role of the linguistic formulations themselves, or about the special properties of the external media that support linguistic encodings. In this treatment, I hope to display the broad shape of such an alternative interest. I begin by discussing the views of some recent (and not-so-recent) authors, who recognize in various ways, the potential role of language and text in transforming, reshaping and simplifying the computational tasks that confront the biological brain. Section 2 pursues this broad vision across a variety of cases involving planning, coordination, learning and the construction of complex thoughts and arguments. The third section extends these last considerations to encompass the rather special class of meta-cognitive operations and tries to implicate language as a n essential {{part of the process of}} thinking about our own thoughts and cognitive profiles.
