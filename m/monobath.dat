40|$|The {{development}} {{characteristics of}} mercaptoacetic acid monobaths {{were compared with}} those of sodium thiosulfate monobaths at varying fixing-agent concentrations. The following differences were noted: (1) it required four times more moles-per-liter of sodium thiosulfate than metcaptoacetic acid to obtain the same rate of fixation; (2) the mercaptoacetic acid <b>monobath</b> produced less silver than the sodium thiosulfate; (3) KODAK Panatomic-X Film developed in a mercaptoacetic acid <b>monobath</b> had a covering power {{greater than or equal to}} that produced by development in the same phenidone-hydroquinone developer without any fixing agent, whereas the covering power of the sodium thiosulfate <b>monobath</b> was less; (4) the density growth of a mercaptoacetic acid <b>monobath</b> showed an initial sharp rise followed by a period of zero growth, whereas the sodium thiosulfate <b>monobath</b> showed a much longer and slower period of density growth; and (5) the time required for a mercaptoacetic acid <b>monobath</b> to reach its maximum density was independent of fixing-agent concentration, whereas that of a sodium thiosulfate <b>monobath</b> increased with decreasing fixing-agent concentration. It was concluded from the comparisons of the development characteristics of the two monobaths that the development of the mercaptoacetic acid <b>monobath</b> proceeded primarily by chemical development, and the development stopped before all of the exposed silver halide could be either removed from the emulsion by the mercaptoacetic acid or reduced to developed silver by the developer. The development of the sodium thiosulfate <b>monobath</b> proceeded initially by chemical development, but after a certain period of time, a significant amount of solution physical development occurred...|$|E
40|$|A <b>monobath</b> {{designed}} for Kodak panatomic-X 35 mm film was obtained, which produced similar contrast and 2 / 3 of a stop {{increase in speed}} as compared to Haist 2 Ì† 7 s <b>monobath</b> MM- 1 formula. Formulation of <b>monobath</b> was based on his formula by increasing the phenidone from 4 to 7 grams, sodium thiosulfate from 110 to 125 grams; pH and temperature were set at 11. 0 and 85 F respectivel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monobath</b> fixing-developers {{facilitate}} the essential simplification of dosimeter film wet processing, especially in eases of catastrophes: 1) No rinsing, no fixation. 2) Above a minimum time the received photographic density is independent from developing time. 3) Temperature dependence {{is less than}} half as marked in conventional development. <b>Monobath</b> development does not influence dependence of energy concerning the film sensitivity; maximum density is about 30 p. c. below conventionaldevelopment...|$|E
40|$|Sludge is {{considered}} by many to be a factor limiting the usefulness of <b>monobaths.</b> A particular film-monobath combination was tested for the effects of sludge on sensitometry, granularity, and acutance. It was found that the presence of sludge did not alter the sensitometric characteristics; however, through solution usage, the acutance and granularity decreased. Removal of the the sludge by filtration during usage resulted in improved image quality over the comparison solution in which sludge was allowed to accumulate...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} which {{show that a}} <b>monobath</b> {{can be used for}} rapid in situ processing in a liquid gate for real-time holographic interferometry. This also permits utilization of a very simple solution handling system. Changes in emulsion thickness are reduced to an acceptable level and problems of matching refractive indices are eliminated by exposing and viewing the holograms in water. Excellent null patterns are obtained and real-time holographic interferometry can be carried out over long periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Image Quality of plus-x film {{processed}} in a <b>monobath</b> solution containing an inorganic silver complexing agent (sodium thiosulfate), {{was compared to}} plus-x film {{processed in}} an organic silver complexing agent (mercaptoacetic acid). A control run using DK- 50 was also made. The image quality of the film was best with DK- 50 and worst with mercaptoacetic acid. Image quality {{was determined by the}} results of the following tests: 1) Resolving Power 2) Acutance 3) MFT 4) Granularit...|$|E
40|$|The United States Air Force {{presently}} uses SO- 233 Duplicating Film for {{the processing}} of transparent prints and has achieved a long straight line curve for reproduction control purposes. Type 8430 Duplicating Film is also used for the same purpose but for different contrasts. Their {{problem was that the}} developer and Type 8430 were not compatible and did not have a sufficiently high density or a long enough straight line. The results of this experiment have yielded a <b>monobath</b> formulation which when used with type 8430 film will give the desired density and straight line required...|$|E
40|$|Aim and Objectives: Obtaining {{a correct}} working length is {{necessary}} for successful root canal treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare conventional and digital radiography in measuring root canal working length. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study 20 mesio buccal canal from maxillary first molars with moderate and severe curvature and 20 canal form anterior teeth with mild curvature were chosen and their working length were measured with number 15 k file (Maillefer, DENTSPLY, Germany). Then for each canal five radiographies were taken, three conventional radiographies using three methods of processing: Manual, automatic, and <b>monobath</b> solution; in addition to two other digital radiographies using CCD and PSP receptors. Two independent observers measured working length in each technique. Finally, the mean of working length in each group was compared with real working length using a paired T-test. Also a one-way ANOVA test was used for comparing the two groups. The level of statistical significance was P 0. 05). Conclusion: Therefore it was concluded that the accuracy of digital radiography is comparable with conventional radiography in measuring working length, so considering the advantages of the digital radiography, it can be used for working length determination...|$|E
40|$|The sensitometric {{effects of}} varying {{developing}} agent concentration, fixing agent concentration, and pH in a <b>monobath</b> developer were studied with Kodak Tri-X Pan film. Three variables (gamma, base plus fog, and a shoulder density) were studied under {{varying levels of}} each of the factors. A factorial experiment was run and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used {{to determine whether or not}} each of the main factors and the two-factor interactions were significant. The higher order interactions were used as a measure of experimental error for the analysis. 	In the range of the factors being investigated, it was found that: 1. gamma decreases linearly with geometrically increasing fixing agent concentration; 2. gamma decreases linearly with increasing pH; 3. studying gamma, both the developing agent concentration-fixing agent concentration interaction and the fixing agent concentration-pH interaction are significant; 4. base plus fog increases linearly with increasing pH; 5. shoulder density increases linearly with geometrically increasing developing agent concentration; 6. shoulder density decreases linearly with geometrically increasing fixing agent concentration; 7. shoulder density decreases linearly with increasing pH; and 8. studying shoulder density, the fixing agent concentration-pH interaction is significant...|$|E
