50|$|To {{visualize}} microscopic structures, it {{is necessary}} to combine an interferometer with the optics of a microscope. Such an arrangement is shown in Figure 3. This setup is similar to a standard optical microscope. The only differences are an interferometric objective lens and an accurate positioning stage (a piezoelectric actuator) to move the objective vertically. The optical magnification of the image on the CCD does not depend on the distance between tube lens and objective lens if the microscope images the object at infinity. The interference objective is {{the most important part of}} such a microscope. Different types of objectives are available. With a Mirau objective, as shown in Figure 3, the reference beam is reflected back in the direction of the objective front lens by a beam splitter. On the front lens there is a miniaturized mirror the same size as the illuminated surface on the object. Therefore, for high magnifications, the mirror is so small that its shadowing effect can be ignored. Moving the interference objective modifies the length of the <b>measurement</b> <b>arm.</b> The interference signal of a pixel has maximum modulation when the optical path length of light impinging on the pixel is exactly the same for the reference and the object beams. As before, the z-value for the point on the surface imaged by this pixel corresponds to the z-value of the positioning stage when the modulation of the correlogram is greatest.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} processes can achieve good throughput by requiring that manufactured products be screened by better quality control exercised at a quicker rate. This {{trend in the}} quality control of manufactured products increases the need for process-oriented precision metrology capable of performing faster inspections and yielding valuable feedback to the manufacturing system. This paper presents a spatially dispersed short-coherence interferometry sensor using diffraction orders of the zeroth and first order for a diffraction grating introduced as a new compact system configuration for surface profile measurement. In this modified design, the diffraction grating acts as the beam splitter/combiner. Diffractions for the zeroth and first orders are represented by the reference and <b>measurement</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively, of a Michelson interferometer, which reduces the optical path length. This innovative design has been proven effective for determining the step-height repeatability in the sensor range from 27 nm to 22 nm for profiles spanning the step heights of the tested specimens...|$|R
40|$|Many {{distance}} measuring interferometers use orthogonally polarized beams in their reference and <b>measurement</b> <b>arms.</b> In practice, instrumental imperfections corrupt the polarized beam in each arm {{with a small}} amplitude signal from the other arm having the perpendicular polarization. The impact of this polarization mixing on the absolute accuracy of a single frequency laser interferometer is shown to be significantly smaller than on the accuracy of a two-frequency interferometer. Certain signals obtained from a single-frequency interferometer have no phase error due to polarization mixing. Other signals are affected {{in proportion to the}} ratio between the small mixing amplitudes and the primary polarization amplitudes. Roughly, those errors in the single frequency device depend on the square of the small mixing ratios while the error in the two frequency interferometer depends on a larger quantity, the sum of these ratios. For a mixing ratio of 0. 1, the error in the single-frequency interferometer is about 20 times smaller than in the heterodyne interferometer...|$|R
50|$|The {{interference}} occurs {{for white}} light when the path lengths of the measurement beam and the reference beam are nearly matched. By scanning (changing) the measurement beam path length {{relative to the}} reference beam, a correlogram is generated at each pixel. The width of the resulting correlogram is the coherence length, which depends strongly on the spectral width of the light source. A test surface having features of different heights leads to a phase pattern that is mixed with {{the light from the}} flat reference in the CCD image sensor plane. Interference occurs at the CCD pixel if the optical path lengths of the two arms differ less than half the coherence length of the light source. Each pixel of the CCD samples a different spatial position within the image of the test surface. A typical white light correlogram (interference signal) is produced when the length of the reference or <b>measurement</b> <b>arm</b> is scanned by a positioning stage through a path length match. The interference signal of a pixel has maximum modulation when the optical path length of light impinging on the pixel is exactly the same for the reference and the object beams. Therefore, the z-value for the point on the surface imaged by this pixel corresponds to the z-value of the positioning stage when the modulation of the correlogram is greatest. A matrix with the height values of the object surface can be derived by determining the z-values of the positioning stage where the modulation is greatest for every pixel. The vertical uncertainty depends mainly on the roughness of the measured surface. For smooth surfaces, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy of the positioning stage. The lateral positions of the height values depend on the corresponding object point that is imaged by the pixel matrix. These lateral coordinates, together with the corresponding vertical coordinates, describe the surface topography of the object.|$|E
