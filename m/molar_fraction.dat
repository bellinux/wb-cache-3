25|$|Spin {{crossover}} {{refers to}} the transitions between high to low, or low to high, spin states. This phenomenon is commonly observed with some first row transition metal complexes with a d4 through d7 electron configuration in an octahedral ligand geometry. Spin transition curves are a common representation of SCO phenomenon with the most commonly observed types depicted in Figure 2 in which γHS (the high-spin <b>molar</b> <b>fraction)</b> is plotted vs. T. The figure shows a gradual spin transition (left), an abrupt transition with hysteresis (middle) and a two-step transition (right). For a transition to be considered gradual, it typically takes place over a large temperature range, even up to several hundred K, whereas for a transition to be considered abrupt, it should take place within 10 K or less.|$|E

2500|$|Values of Henry's law {{constants}} for aqueous solutions {{depend on}} {{the composition of the}} solution, i.e., on its ionic strength and on dissolved organics. In general, the solubility of a gas decreases with increasing salinity ("salting out"). However, a [...] "salting in" [...] effect has also been observed, for example for the effective Henry's law constant of glyoxal. The effect can be described with the Sechenov equation, named after the Russian physiologist Ivan Sechenov (sometimes the German transliteration [...] "Setschenow" [...] of the Cyrillic name Се́ченов is used). There are many alternative ways to define the Sechenov equation, depending on how the aqueous-phase composition is described (based on concentration, molality, or <b>molar</b> <b>fraction)</b> and which variant of the Henry's law constant is used. Describing the solution in terms of molality is preferred because molality is invariant to temperature and to the addition of dry salt to the solution.

40|$|A {{method that}} uses the abundances of large {{clusters}} formed in electrospray ionization to determine the solution-phase <b>molar</b> <b>fractions</b> of amino acids in multi-component mixtures is demonstrated. For solutions containing either four or 10 amino acids, the relative abundances of protonated molecules differed from their solution-phase <b>molar</b> <b>fractions</b> by up to 30 -fold and 100 fold, respectively. For the four-component mixtures, the <b>molar</b> <b>fractions</b> determined from the abundances of larger clusters consisting of 19 or more molecules were within 25 % of the solution-phase <b>molar</b> <b>fractions,</b> indicating that the abundances and compositions of these clusters reflect the relative concentrations of these amino acids in solution, and that ionization and detection biases are significantly reduced. Lower accuracy was obtained for the 10 component mixtures where values determined from the cluster abundances were typically within a factor of three of their solution <b>molar</b> <b>fractions.</b> The lower accuracy of this method with the more complex mixtures {{may be due to}} specific clustering effects owing to the heterogeneity as a result of significantly different physical properties of the components, or it {{may be the result of}} lower S/N for the more heterogeneous clusters and not including the low-abundance more highly heterogeneous clusters in this analysis.
