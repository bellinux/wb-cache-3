40|$|Abstract The Active <b>Magnetic</b> Regenerative <b>Refrigeration</b> (AMRR) {{cycle is}} {{a special kind of}} {{regenerator}} for the magnetic refrigerator, in which the magnetic material matrix works both as a refrigerating medium and as a heat regenerating medium, while the fluid flowing in the porous matrix works as a heat transfer medium. The performance of an AMRR cycle depends strongly on the behaviour of the adiabatic magnetization temperature change as a function of material temperature in the flow direction of the regenerator. In the present paper, a practical model for predicting the performance and efficiency of an AMRR cycle has been developed. The model simulates both the ferromagnetic material and the entire cycle of an AMR operating in conformity with a Brayton regenerative cycle. The model simulates different kinds of layered regenerators operating at their optimal operation point.

With this model, the refrigeration capacity, the power consumption and consequently the coefficient of performance can be predicted.

This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of an Active <b>Magnetic</b> Regenerative <b>Refrigeration</b> (AMRR) system for space applications. The AMRR can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at about 2 K and reject heat at temperatures higher than 15 K. The AMRR employs a reversible circulator to circulate helium bi-directionally through magnetic regenerators. The circulating flow facilitates the heat transfer in the magnetic regenerators. The circulator uses self-acting gas bearings for reliable and vibration-free operation. The AMRR also uses structured-bed regenerators with microchannels for high thermal performance. Demonstrations to date have shown the ability of the circulator to operate at high speeds and low sub-atmospheric pressures. Hardware fabrication for the circulator and its demonstration are near completion, while development of the fabrication method for the regenerator is in progress. The results of this research show that the AMRR system is very attractive for space applications. The AMRR will be very reliable and vibration free. The predicted COP of the AMRR system is about 35 % of a Carnot cycle with cryogenic heat sinks. The system can operate at the very short cycle period of 10 seconds to achieve a large cooling capacity. The AMRRï¿½s ability to provide remote/distributed cooling not only allows flexible integration with payload(s) and spacecraft, but also reduces the mass of the required magnetic shields...|$|R
40|$|A {{design of}} an Active <b>Magnetic</b> Regenerative <b>Refrigeration</b> (AMRR) {{system has been}} {{developed}} for space applications. It uses an innovative 3 He cryogenic circulator to provide continuous remote/distributed cooling at temperatures {{in the range of}} 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K. A critical component technology for this cooling system is a highly efficient active magnetic regenerator, which is a regenerative heat exchanger with its matrix material made of magnetic refrigerant gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG). Creare Inc. is developing a microchannel GGG regenerator with an anisotropic structured bed for high system thermal efficiency. The regenerator core consists of a stack of thin, single-crystal GGG disks alternating with thin polymer insulating layers. The insulating layers help minimize the axial conduction heat leak, since GGG has a very high thermal conductivity in the regenerator s operating temperature range. The GGG disks contain micro channels with width near 100 micrometers, which enhance the heat transfer between the circulating flow and the refrigerant bed. The unique flow configuration of the GGG plates ensures a uniform flow distribution across the plates. The main fabrication challenges for the regenerator are the machining of high-aspect-ratio microchannels in fragile, single-crystal GGG disks and fabrication and assembly of the GGG insulation layers. Feasibility demonstrations to date include use of an ultrashort- pulse laser to machine microchannels without producing unacceptable microcracking or deposition of recast material, as shown in the figure, and attachment of a thin insulation layer to a GGG disk without obstructing the flow paths. At the time of this reporting, efforts were focused on improving the laser machining process to increase machining speed and further reduce microcracking...|$|R

Despite the {{high concentration of}} the doping Er 3 + ions and relatively large size (8 nm) of these nanoparticles we have found no deviation between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetization curves down to T = 0. 35 K, which points out an ultralow blocking temperature for the reversal of magnetization. We also have found strongly deviating magnetization curves M(H/T) for different temperatures T. These results altogether show that the investigated nanoparticles are not superparamagnetic, but rather each Er 3 + ion in these nanoparticles is found in a paramagnetic state down to very low temperatures, which implies {{the breakdown of the}} Neel-Brown giant spin model in the case of these nanoparticles.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Gregory F. Nellis and Sanford A. Klein. Active <b>magnetic</b> regenerator <b>refrigeration</b> (AMRR) systems are an environmentally attractive space cooling and refrigeration alternative that do not use a fluorocarbon working fluid. Two recent developments have made AMRRs appear possible to implement in the near-term. A rotary regenerator bed utilizing practical and affordable permanent magnets has been demonstrated to achieve acceptable COP. Concurrently, families of magnetocaloric material alloys with adjustable Curie temperatures have been developed. Using these materials {{it is possible to}} construct a layered regenerator bed that can achieve a high magnetocaloric effect across its entire operating range, resulting in an improved COP. There is currently no tool capable of predicting the performance of a layered AMRR. This project provides a numerical model that predicts the practical limits of these systems for use in space conditioning and refrigeration applications. The model treats the regenerator bed as a one dimensional matrix of magnetic material with a spatial variation in Curie temperature and therefore magnetic properties. The matrix is subjected to a spatially and temporally varying magnetic field and fluid mass flow. The variation of these forcing functions is based on the implementation of a rotating, multiple bed configuration. The numerical model is solved using a fully implicit (in time and space) discretization of the governing energy equations. The nonlinear aspects of the governing equations (e. g., fluid and magnetic property variations) are handled using a relaxation technique. The model is used to optimize AMRR applications by varying model inputs such as matrix material, fluid mass flow rate, working fluid, reservoir temperatures, and the variation of the Curie temperature across the bed. The preliminary model has been verified qualitatively using simple cycle parameters and constant property materials and quantitatively by comparing the results with prior solutions to the regenerator governing equations in the limits of constant properties and no magnetocaloric effect. A second goal of this project is to create a cost estimate for a future project that will design, build, and test a prototype AMRR to be used to verify the numerical model.
