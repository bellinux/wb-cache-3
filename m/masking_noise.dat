5000|$|When {{sound is}} applied to one ear the {{contralateral}} cochlea can also be stimulated to varying degrees, via vibrations through the bone of the skull. When the stimuli presented to the test ear stimulates the cochlea of the non-test ear, {{this is known as}} cross hearing. Whenever it is suspected that cross hearing has occurred it is best to use masking. This is done by temporarily elevating the threshold of the non-test ear, by presenting a <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> at a predetermined level. This prevents the non-test ear from detecting the test signal presented to the test ear. The threshold of the test ear is measured {{at the same time as}} presenting the <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> to the non-test ear. Thus, thresholds obtained when masking has been applied, provide an accurate representation of the true hearing threshold level of the test ear.|$|E

50|$|Phonemic {{restoration}} {{effect is}} a perceptual phenomenon where under certain conditions, sounds actually missing from a speech signal can be restored by the brain and {{may appear to be}} heard. The effect occurs when missing phonemes in an auditory signal are replaced with a <b>masking</b> <b>noise,</b> resulting in the brain filling in absent phonemes. The effect can be so strong that some listeners may not even notice that there are phonemes missing. This effect is commonly observed in a conversation with heavy background noise, making it difficult to properly hear every phoneme being spoken. Different factors can change the strength of the effect, including age and gender.|$|E
50|$|Gelfand {{provides}} a basic example. Let us {{say that for}} a given individual, {{the sound of a}} cat scratching a post in an otherwise quiet environment is first audible at a level of 10 dB SPL. However, {{in the presence of a}} <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> (for example, a vacuum cleaner that is running simultaneously) that same individual cannot detect the sound of the cat scratching unless the level of the scratching sound is at least 26 dB SPL. We would say that the unmasked threshold for that individual for the target sound (i.e., the cat scratching) is 10 dB SPL, while the masked threshold is 26 dB SPL. The amount of masking is simply the difference between these two thresholds: 16 dB.|$|E
5000|$|Intelligibility is {{negatively}} {{impacted by}} background noise {{and too much}} reverberation. The relationship between sound and noise levels is generally {{described in terms of}} a signal-to-noise ratio. With a background noise level between 35 and 100 dB, the threshold for 100% intelligibility is usually a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB. 12 dB means that the signal should be roughly 4 times louder that the background noise. The speech signal ranges from about 200-8000 Hz, while human hearing ranges from about 20-20,000 Hz, so the effects of masking depend on the frequency range of the <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> Additionally, different speech sounds make use of different parts of the speech frequency spectrum, so a continuous background noise such as white or pink noise will have a different effect on intelligibility than a variable or modulated background noise such as competing speech, multi-talker or [...] "cocktail party" [...] babble, or industrial machinery.|$|E

The spectrum of the <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> was brown noise modified by a PC audio controller and earphones (the spectrum of the modified brown noise was substantially different to that of brown <b>masking</b> <b>noise).</b> The questionnaire based quantitative study (Study 1, n = 28) indicates that disturbance to concentration and task performance is reduced by modified brown <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> thereby confirming previous studies. However all the participants in the qualitative study, which involved both open ended questionnaire and focus group interviews, (Study 2, n = 28 for open ended questionnaire and 12 for focus groups) identified that they would not use earphones with modified brown <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> to counteract office noise.

40|$|Background: The {{brainstem}} auditory-evoked response (BAER) {{is currently}} the standard evaluation method of hearing in dogs. In asymmetrical hearing loss in human patients, simultaneous presentation of <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> to the nontest ear is routinely performed during BAER to eliminate the crossover effect. Hypothesis: The crossover effect occurs during canine BAER, and <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> of 20 decibels (dB) below click stimulus intensity is sufficient to abolish this effect. Animals: Fifty-six Dalmatian puppies with confirmed unilateral deafness. Methods: The BAER was elicited with 80 and 100 dB normalized hearing level (dBnHL) stimulus intensity in the deaf ear. The 100 dBnHL stimulus was repeated while simultaneously applying 80 dBnHL white <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> to the nontest ear. Results: Ten dogs {{were excluded because of}} BAER trace baseline fluctuation. In the remaining 46 dogs, 8 dogs had no waveforms, but 38 dogs had an identifiable wave-V in the deaf ear BAER at 80 dBnHL intensity stimulus. At 100 dBnHL intensity stimulus, all but 1 dog had a discernible wave-V in the deaf ear BAER. The deaf ear BAER waveforms were abolished by white <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> at 80 dBnHL in the nontest ear in all dogs. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Abolition of BAER wave-V in the deaf ear by white <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> in the nontest ear suggests that this wave is caused by the crossover effect. beta distribution indicates 95 % confidence that white <b>masking</b> <b>noise,</b> at 20 dB below click stimulus intensity, would abolish this crossover effect in over 90 % of the dogs.

30|$|There {{are some}} caveats: first, {{it is not}} {{necessarily}} possible to differentiate between iris and eyelid purely based on the mask—pruning and succeeding model-fitting helps to reduce such effects. Second, some algorithms employ different boundary models for rubbersheet mapping and <b>noise</b> <b>masks</b> (see [22]). Even in the recent 4.1 version of OSIRIS, <b>noise</b> <b>masks</b> extend over actual boundaries used for unrolling the iris image [5], which has been corrected in experiments by limiting the mask to the employed rubbersheet limbic boundary. Ideally, the employed <b>noise</b> <b>mask</b> for scanning ignores eyelids or other occlusions and a separate <b>noise</b> <b>mask</b> for occlusions is considered at a later stage (e.g. via majority voting after normalisation). While masks may not necessarily be convex and may contain holes, such inconsistencies are repaired by a heuristical algorithm employing simple morphological closing and simplifying local inconsistencies where necessary.

40|$|Detection of {{a signal}} in the {{presence}} of diotic <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> is much better when the signal differs in terms of its interaural parameters from the <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> Besides contributing to the detectability of a signal, interaural time delays (ITDs) also allow the listener to lateralize the signal. In this study, we investigate how detection and lateralization of time-delayed signals are affected by the diotic <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> All stimuli covered a spectral range from 250 to 850 Hz. The interaurally time-delayed signals consisted either of noise, or a tone-complex with 20 Hz intercomponent spacing. ITDs were 0. 1 or 0. 6 msec. Results show that detection performance is strongly dependent on the ITD with a 10 dB increase in threshold going from 0. 6 to 0. 1 msec ITD. Interestingly, lateralization thresholds, although being higher than detection thresholds, are much less dependent on ITD; only a few dB change in threshold is observed. An additional ITD adjustment experiment was performed where the ITD of a tone complex in isolation had to be adjusted to an ITD tone-complex presented in diotic and roving-ITD <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> Listeners were able to perform this adjustment reliably suggesting that in the noise, the tone complex effectively functions as a segregated object...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} following potential (FFP) is an auditory {{evoked response}} which crudely replicates the waveform of the stimulus. The origins of this far-field potential have been localized to the cochlea and specific auditory nuclei. The initiation {{site of the}} FFP along the cochlear partition has been thought to be dependent upon stimulus sound pressure level. Low stimulus levels elicit FFP from the apical turn of the cochlea, while moderate and high stimulus levels may elicit FFP from {{a large segment of}} the partition, including the basal turn. Simultaneous masking studies have contributed to the knowledge of this potential, but results from these studies may be confounded by interference from bioelectric potentials generated by distortion products from the <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> This investigation used non-simultaneous masking tones set at the subject's pulsation threshold level (PTL). This psychophysical method provides a representation of the frequency-resolving properties of the auditory periphery in a repeated gap masking paradigm. Patterns of the relative masking effect of each masking tone were plotted and compared for several probe levels and in the presence or absence of a continuous, high-pass <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> Tuning patterns derived in high-pass making noise effectively represented apical turn FFP. Those patterns without <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> represented whole-cochlea FFP. The results of this study demonstrarted tuning patterns that reflected diminished FFP amplitudes in the primary 500 Hz region as well as in an extended secondary range of 800 to 2000 Hz, depending on the stimulus-masking parameters. Tuning patterns in high-pass <b>masking</b> <b>noise</b> were consistently flatter in the primary and secondary regions than for the tuning patterns without <b>masking</b> <b>noise.</b> The secondary regions of the tuning patterns extended above 2000 Hz for the patterns obtained without high-pass masking. Tuning patterns were consistently broader for the high stimulus level than for the moderate stimulus level. The multiple cochlear initiation sites for the FFP preclude its use as an audiological tool for the assessment of low-frequency hearing. However, the potential is suggested as a method to assess whole-cochlear response for the difficult-to-test patients with suspected profound hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|Image quality models usually {{include a}} {{mechanism}} whereby artifacts are masked {{by the image}} acting as a background. Scientific study of visual masking has followed two traditions: contrast <b>masking</b> and <b>noise</b> <b>masking,</b> depending primarily on whether the mask is deterministic or random.

40|$|It {{is known}} that visual noise added to {{sinusoidal}} gratings changes the typical U-shaped threshold curve which becomes flat in log-log scale for frequencies below 10 c/deg when gratings are <b>masked</b> with white <b>noise</b> of high power spectral density level. These results have been explained using the critical-band-masking (CBM) model by supposing a visual filter-bank of constant relative bandwidth. However, some psychophysical and biological data {{support the idea of}} variable octave bandwidth. The CBM model has been used here to explain the progressive change of threshold curves with the <b>noise</b> <b>mask</b> level and to estimate the bandwidth of visual filters. Bayesian staircases were used in a 2 IFC paradigm to measure contrast thresholds of horizontal sinusoidal gratings (0. 25 - 8 c/deg) within a fixed Gaussian window and masked with one-dimensional, static, broadband white noise with each of five power density levels. Raw data showed that the contrast threshold curve progressively shifts upward and flattens out as the <b>mask</b> <b>noise</b> level increases. Theoretical thresholds from the CBM model were fitted simultaneously to the data at all five noise levels using visual filters with log-Gaussian gain functions.
