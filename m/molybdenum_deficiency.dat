40|$|AbstractMolybdenum {{cofactor}} deficiency is a fatal neurological disorder, {{which follows}} an autosomal-recessive trait and {{is characterized by}} combined deficiency of the enzyme, sulfite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase. Early detection of molybdenum cofactor-deficient patients is essential for their proper care and genetic counseling of families at risk. We demonstrate the use of S-sulfonated transthyretin (TTR) as a marker for <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor <b>deficiency.</b> Plasma or sera obtained from 4 patients with <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor <b>deficiency</b> and 57 controls were studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) following selective enrichment of TTR by immunoprecipitation using protein G/A agarose. The data obtained from <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor <b>deficiency</b> samples indicated a strong increase in the peak height of S-sulfonated TTR. A more significant difference was revealed if the peak height ratio of S-sulfonated TTR and {{the sum of the}} other oxidized TTR were determined. By accurate determination of the ratio, the samples of <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor <b>deficiency</b> patients could clearly be distinguished from controls without <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor <b>deficiency...</b>|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis of <b>Molybdenum</b> {{cofactor}} <b>deficiency</b> includes early seizures, low {{blood levels}} of uric acid, {{and high levels of}} sulphite, xanthine, and uric acid in urine. Additionally, the disease produces characteristic MRI images that can aid in diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is common}} in many {{different}} types of soil; some soils have low total Mo concentrations, and others have low plant-available Mo due to strong Mo sorption. Symptoms are most common where both conditions apply, such as in acid sandy soils. Molybdenum may be strongly sorbed in ironstone soils. Liming of soils frequently relieves Mo deficiency by decreasing Mo sorption.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum is a {{cofactor}} to enzymes {{important in}} building amino acids and {{is involved in}} nitrogen metabolism. Molybdenum {{is part of the}} nitrate reductase enzyme (needed for the reduction of nitrate) and the nitrogenase enzyme (required for biological nitrogen fixation).

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of molybdenum for plant growth is disproportionate {{with respect to}} the absolute amounts required by most plants. Apart from Cu, Mo is the least abundant essential micronutrient found in most plant tissues and is often set as the base from which all other nutrients are compared and measured. Molybdenum is utilized by selected enzymes to carry out redox reactions. Enzymes that require molybdenum for activity include nitrate reductase, xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase and sulfite oxidase. Scope: Loss of Mo-dependent enzyme activity (directly or indirectly through low internal molybdenum levels) impacts upon plant development, in particular, those processes involving nitrogen metabolism and the synthesis of the phytohormones abscisic acid and indole- 3 butyric acid. Currently, there is little information on how plants access molybdate from the soil solution and redistribute it within the plant. In this review, the role of molybdenum in plants is discussed, focusing on its current constraints in some agricultural situations and where increased molybdenum nutrition may aid in agricultural plant development and yields. Conclusions: <b>Molybdenum</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are considered rare in most agricultural cropping areas; however, the phenotype is often misdiagnosed and attributed to other downstream effects associated with its role in various enzymatic redox reactions. Molybdenum fertilization through foliar sprays can effectively supplement internal <b>molybdenum</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and rescue the activity of molybdoenzymes. The current understanding on how plants access molybdate from the soil solution or later redistribute it once in the plant is still unclear; however, plants have similar physiological molybdenum transport phenotypes to those found in prokaryotic systems. Thus, careful analysis of existing prokaryotic molybdate transport mechanisms, as well as a re-examination of know anion transport mechanisms present in plants, will help to resolve how this important trace element is accumulated.

40|$|Severely Ca-deficient Triticum aestivum L. {{seedlings}} accumulated {{high levels}} of nitrite and moderate levels of nitrate and organic nitrogen, but contained unaltered levels of hydroxylamine. Nitrite accumulation {{was not related to}} <b>molybdenum</b> <b>deficiency,</b> or altered cellular pH. Nitrate reductase was decreased by Ca deficiency, apparently by repression of enzyme synthesis from accumulated nitrite and not by inhibition of enzyme activity. Nitrite reductase and NADP diaphorase activities were not affected by Ca deficiency, and Ca did not restore activity to nitrite reductase inactivated by cyanide. The results indicated that the role of Ca is in intracellular transport of nitrite and not in induction or activity of enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Activity of {{nitrate reductase}} from Triticum aestivum L. {{seedlings}} was decreased by deficiencies of molybdenum, zinc, and chlorine. Nitrate accumulated in molybdenum-deficient seedlings, declined in zinc-deficient seedlings, and was {{unaffected by the}} other micronutrient treatments. Glutamic acid dehydrogenase activity was decreased by deficiency of molybdenum, the only nutrient that affected the enzyme. Glutamine synthetase activity was decreased only by copper deficiency, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase was not affected by any micronutrient deficiencies. Incorporation of 14 C-leucine into protein by wheat seedlings was increased by <b>molybdenum</b> <b>deficiency,</b> apparently because of decreased inhibition from endogenous amino acids, and was decreased by copper deficiency.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for molybdenum. Molybdenum is {{efficiently}} and rapidly absorbed at {{a wide range of}} intakes, and the body is able to maintain homeostasis through the regulation of excretion via the urine. <b>Molybdenum</b> <b>deficiency</b> in otherwise healthy humans has not been observed and there are no biomarkers of molybdenum status. Various metabolic balance studies have been performed to establish molybdenum requirements. However, only one balance study, which was performed with a constant diet and under controlled conditions in adult men, was considered to be of sufficient duration. In this small study, balance was reported to be near zero when molybdenum intakes were 22  µg/day. Biochemical changes or symptoms suggestive of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>deficiency</b> were not observed, and it is possible that humans may be able to achieve molybdenum balance at even lower intakes. Data on molybdenum intakes and health outcomes were unavailable for the setting of DRVs for molybdenum. As the evidence required to derive an Average Requirement and a Population Reference Intake was considered insufficient, an Adequate Intake (AI) is proposed. Observed molybdenum intakes from mixed diets in Europe were taken into consideration in setting this value. An AI of 65  µg/day is proposed for adults; a figure that is based on molybdenum intakes {{at the lower end of}} the wide range of observed intakes. It is suggested that the adult AI also applies to pregnant and lactating women. An AI is also proposed for infants from seven months and for children based on extrapolation from the adult AI using isometric scaling and the reference body weights of the respective age groups...|$|E
40|$|Past {{failure of}} yellow tree lupin (Lupinus arboreus Sims) at Pouto Forest can be {{ascribed}} {{to a combination}} of factors including multiple nutrient de-ficiencies, exposure, and pest attack. Marked growth responses to molybdenum application and to sulphur in the presence of molybdenum have been obtained. A small response to boron in the presence of molybdenum was also noted. Deficiencies of molybdenum, sulphur, and boron have not been reported in other New Zealand sand dune forests. At Pouto {{it is likely that the}} combination of neutral sand pH, high leaching potential, and absence of fresh sand accretion from the foreshore results in losses of these elements which exceed the natural input. Correction of nutrient deficiency is expected to increase plant vigour to a point where other factors have a negligible effect on the development of an adequate lupin cover.
