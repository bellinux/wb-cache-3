5|$|The DSi XL has a <b>matte</b> <b>surface,</b> and the {{exterior}} of its top panel is coated with a gloss finish. It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region such as white, green, red, yellow, and pink. Two special-edition models were released: those for LovePlus+ and the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. Flipnote Studio and the Nintendo DSi Browser come pre-installed with the DSi XL, alongside other, region-specific software.|$|E

Numerous special-edition models and bundles have been released, including those for , , and the 2009 Black Friday shopping day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a <b>matte</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Gleizes and {{his wife}} {{remained}} in France under the German occupation. In 1942 Gleizes began the series of Supports de Contemplation, large scale, entirely non-representational paintings that are both very complex and very serene. Materials being difficult to obtain during the war, Gleizes painted on burlap, sizing the porous material {{with a mixture of}} glue and paint. He had used burlap in some of his earliest paintings and now found it favorable to his vigorous touch, for it took the most powerful strokes even while preserving the <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> he so valued. In 1952, Gleizes realized his last major work, a fresco titled Eucharist that he painted for a Jesuit chapel in Chantilly.|$|E
500|$|Van Gogh had {{previously}} decorated rooms with his paintings, {{in particular the}} rooms of several restaurants in Paris and the Yellow House in Arles. [...] Gauguin and de Haan {{appear to have been}} influenced by this work, as they began decorating the dining room of Buvette de la Plage in a similar fashion. Gauguin's Self-Portrait was prepared along with its , Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889), [...] to the right and left respectively of a fireplace on the upper panels of two wooden cupboard doors. [...] Gauguin gave the panels a subtle, textured <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> using white chalk ground and a combed wave pattern. [...] Both works were completed sometime between mid-November and mid-December 1889.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} matte finish and {{modularity}} on loosening of tapered stems {{using the same}} cementing technique were studied prospectively. In 80 patients, 82 cemented Exeter primary stems were implanted at total hip revision by one surgeon using the same surgical and cementing technique throughout the series. The polished stems behaved differently than the <b>matte</b> <b>surfaced</b> stems behaved. Polished stems subsided in the cement mantle an average of 1 mm at 2 years after implantation, but without subsequent loosening of stems at as long as 12 years after implantation. <b>Matte</b> <b>surfaced</b> stems with metal centralizers had a higher loosening rate, and loss of fixation at the prosthesis to cement interface was identified as an early sign of loosening of these stems. At a mean 6 -year followup, there were no revisions nor was there radiographic evidence of loosening of the polished modular stems. It is concluded that matte finish results in increased loosening of tapered stems but the introduction of modularity did not.

2500|$|The {{influence}} of Seurat’s French contemporary Pierre Puvis de Chavannes—and in particular of his Doux Pays {{shown at the}} Salon of 1882—is also evident in the Bathers. Both paintings are on the monumental scale—that of Puvis’ being over four metres long—and both works have life-size figures. The theme of the architectonic group of figures to the left in Doux Pays is echoed by Seurat; where Puvis shows a half-pedimental group in one plane, Seurat uses recession, and suggests association by means of repetition. The two paintings also share the technique of dividing their large canvases into areas of predominant colours—of blue and gold in Doux Pays, to rather cool effect, and of blue and green in the Bathers with a warmer result. In both paintings a prominent figure breaks into the horizon just off-centre, a curved sail appears in almost the same spot to the right, and triangular poses are observed, as are boys in varying degrees of restivity.

50|$|Drafting {{film is a}} {{sturdier}} {{and more}} dimensionally stable substitute for drafting paper sometimes used for technical drawings, especially architectural drawings, and for art layout drawings, replacing drafting linen for these purposes. Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate, which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, {{with one or two}} translucent <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces</b> provided by a coating. However, some older drafting films are cellulose acetate, which degrades in only a few decades due to the vinegar syndrome. Uncoated films are preferred for archival, because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.|$|R

This problem is addressed in this report. In contrast to <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces,</b> there are different influencing factors for the perception of specular surfaces.

50|$|Matte polish is like regular polish, {{but has a}} {{purposely}} {{dull finish}} rather than a shine. It can be purchased as a regular base coat in ranges of different colors.

The matte top coat polish will dull the shine from a regular base coat polish.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on visual perception of surface material has {{focused primarily on}} smooth, <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces,</b> neglecting surfaces with pronounced three-dimensional (3 D) texture or specularity. Furthermore, studies have typically focused on single material properties, with no consideration of possible interactions. In this study, we used a conjoint measurement design to determine how observers represent perceived 3 D texture (“bumpiness”) and specularity (“glossiness”) and modeled how each of these two surface material properties affects perception of the other. Observers made judgments of “bumpiness ” and “glossiness ” of surfaces that varied in both surface texture and specularity. We found that a simple additive model captures visual perception of texture and specularity and their interactions. We quantify how changes in each surface material property affect judgments of the other.

40|$|Harnessing the sun's energy with {{a passive}} solar design can mean {{substantial}} savings on utility bills. All that extra heat and sunlight can also pose some decorating challenges. Unless you plan carefully, your decorating scheme will interfere with the efficiency of your {{passive solar design}}, and the heat and sunlight will harm your furnishings. Floors, wall, furniture, fabrics, window treatments and accessories — the basic elements in any decorating plan — need {{to be thought of}} in terms of your passive solar design. Floors The floor of your solar home exposed to the sun {{is an important part of}} the passive design. It acts as a mass material, absorbing sunlight, conducting surface heat into its mass and holding onto that heat. The best thermal mass materials have dark colored, rough, <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces.</b> They may include concrete, brick, slate, ceramic tile and marble. Concrete, for example, can be stained before it is poured, or it can be patterned and colored to look like brick or slate giving you an economical, functional and attractive floor. Wall to wall carpeting should not be used on a thermal mass floor. Area rugs can be used if they are kept small. Remember to turn them so fading and wear will be even. Navahos, kilims and dhurries "weather" well. Straw or sisal mats are excellent choices. They soften the thermal mass floor, do not fade or interfere with heat flow and can absorb excess humidity.
