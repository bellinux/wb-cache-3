5000|$|The story centres around Simon Martin, a pupil {{in class}} 4C at an unnamed school. 4C is the class {{reserved}} for the school's worst students. As it so happens, a new student has arrived at the school, and, by sheer coincidence, his name is Martin Simon. The two boys are the complete antithesis of each other - Martin Simon passed all his science exams with flying colours, reads voraciously and even speaks and reads French fluently. The class teacher, Mr. Cartright, sends the boy to Dr. Feltham's class, and Simon, who had been sent there by accident, soon arrives. The class are choosing their options for their contribution to the school Science Fair. They wish they could work {{on one of the}} most exciting experiments - The Exploding Custard Tins, Soap Factory, or <b>Maggot</b> <b>Farm,</b> for example - but these have been reserved for those who passed their science exams. As a result, 4C have ended up having to choose between a series of boring experiments. First they have to choose a topic - their options are consumer studies, textiles, child development, nutrition, and domestic economy. Simon Martin is given the task of pulling a voting slip out of a tub; Martin Simon's slip comes out, and the topic he has chosen is [...] "child development".|$|E

50|$|<b>Maggot</b> <b>farming</b> is the act {{of growing}} maggots for the industry. It is {{distinct}} from vermicomposting {{as there is no}} separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from worms (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material).|$|R
40|$|In a {{regional}} case-control study of coarse fishing and urothelial cancer, histories from 989 patients with tumours diagnosed {{in the period}} 1985 - 87 were compared with histories from 2, 059 unmatched electoral register controls and 1, 599 matched general practitioner controls. Angling {{and the use of}} dyed maggots by anglers were not found to be risk factors. The study emphasises the importance of the established risk factor of cigarette smoking. Coarse fishermen use synthetic dyes to stain maggot bait. The three dyes most frequently used are auramine (yellow), rhodamine (red), and chrysoidine (bronze). Red and yellow maggots are produced on <b>maggot</b> <b>farms</b> by adding rhodamine or auramine to meat on which the maggots (larvae of Calliphora erythrocephala) feed. They become internally dyed and when sold have little free dye on their surface; contamination of the fishermen's hands is therefore minimal. Larvae do not readily ingest chrysoidine dye an...|$|R
