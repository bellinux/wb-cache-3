25|$|Beryl {{of various}} colors is found most {{commonly}} in granitic pegmatites, but also occurs in mica schists in the Ural Mountains, and limestone in Colombia. Beryl is {{often associated with}} tin and tungsten ore bodies. Beryl is found in Europe in Norway, Austria, Germany, Sweden (especially <b>morganite),</b> Ireland and Russia, as well as Brazil, Colombia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa, the United States, and Zambia. US beryl locations are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah.|$|E
25|$|In Dark Magick Morgan was {{betrayed by}} the first boy she ever loved (Cal). Now Morgan must attempt {{to get on with}} her life. Morgan begins to study with Hunter, and slowly begins to realize her {{feelings}} for him. But dark magick seems to be surrounding them and someone close is to blame. Hunter and Morgan slowly start to get closer throughout the book. Hunter suspects that the dark magick is being used by David Redstone, owner of Practical Magick, and Morgan's friend. Morgan does everything she can to try and prove it was not him, but in the end, Hunter is right. The day before David gets stripped of his powers, Morgan and Hunter share a passionate kiss, and after Hunter strips David of his powers, he gives Morgan the stone <b>Morganite,</b> and it shows that Morgan is the thing/person that Hunter desires most in his heart.|$|E
500|$|Individual {{items on}} display include {{coprolite}} from Mongolia, a 500-pound (227kg) {{piece of the}} lightweight volcanic rock pumice, obsidian and basalt. One specimen on display is a [...] wide plate with clear quartz crystals, epidote crystals measuring as large as 10cm and translucent calcite scalenohedrons, and comes from Green Monster Mountain on Alaska's Prince of Wales Island. The collection includes a cycad fossil dating from the Jurassic era that weighs 500 pounds (227kg). One meteorite is the Gibeon meteorite which weighs 210 pounds (95kg) and came from the African nation of Namibia. The world's largest known opal-filled thunderegg, weighing 1.75 tons (1600kg), is housed at the museum. The thunderegg is Oregon's state rock.

50|$|Most (if not all) of the Madagascan {{deposits}} {{have since}} been exhausted. Pezzottaite {{has been found in}} at least one other locality, Afghanistan: this material was first thought to be caesium-rich <b>morganite</b> (pink beryl). Like <b>morganite</b> and bixbite, pezzottaite is believed to owe its color to radiation-induced color centres involving trivalent manganese. Pezzottaite will lose its color if heated to 450 °C for two hours, but the color can be restored with gamma irradiation.|$|E

Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island {{on the coast of}} Madagascar in 1910. It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as tourmaline and kunzite, at Pala, California. In December 1910, the New York Academy of Sciences named the pink variety of beryl [...] "morganite" [...] after financier J. P. Morgan. On October 7, 1989, one of the largest gem <b>morganite</b> specimens ever uncovered, eventually called [...] "The Rose of Maine," [...] was found at the Bennett Quarry in Buckfield, Maine, US.

50|$|In 1939 the company's {{subsidiary}} <b>Morganite</b> Crucible {{opened its}} works at Norton in Worcestershire. During the Second World War this facility employed European Voluntary Workers who were accommodated at Bowbrook House in nearby Peopleton. In 2010 the site, which {{had recently been}} closed, was sold for use as an industrial estate, but a Morgan presence remained {{in the shape of}} Molten Metals Ltd, a company set up by former Morgan employees Dave Hill and Jim Ritchie to distribute <b>Morganite</b> products and manufacture Morgan furnaces under licence.|$|E
50|$|There are 8 {{rooms in}} the hotel, each named after gemstones mined in Afghanistan and Pakistan: lapis lazuli, spinel, <b>morganite,</b> tourmaline, topaz, peridot, ruby, and garnet. The {{restaurant}} is designed on the pattern of a traditional Pashtun hujra with traditional bajotes (small sitting level dining tables), filigreed brass lanterns, garnet floors and handmade carpets. Lapis room has genuine lapis lazuli tiles that {{were made by the}} celebrated Afghan jeweler, the late Naib-ud-din. The library and all public rooms are tiled with almandine garnet in marble. <b>Morganite</b> room is tiled in <b>morganite</b> crystals imbedded in marble. The entrance doors to the Khan Klub and guest rooms have original stained glass windows that were produced in Murshidabad (India) in the late 18th Century. The main structure of the hotel, as well as carved jharokas (decorative façades) and jalis (filigreed panels), are also made from wood of giant Himalayan cedar.|$|E

50|$|For example, beryl, {{which is}} colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with {{chromium}} impurities. If manganese is added instead of chromium, beryl becomes pink <b>morganite.</b> With iron, it becomes aquamarine.|$|E
50|$|Pala was {{the site}} where <b>morganite</b> beryl was first discovered. In 1902 it {{was found to have}} the first commercially {{significant}} deposit of kunzite, named after George F. Kunz, the godfather of gemology.|$|E
50|$|The mineral was misidentified as alkali beryl (<b>morganite)</b> at that time. Subsequently, in September, 1975, {{additional}} {{specimens of}} the mineral {{were found in}} a float boulder {{on the north side}} of Kangaroo Ridge at an approximate elevation of 6500 feet; it was recognized that the material was not beryl.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 <b>Morganite</b> Crucible, a {{subsidiary}} of Morgan Crucible, opened its works in the village.

50|$|Gemstones are {{classified}} into different groups, species, and varieties. For example, ruby is the red {{variety of the}} species corundum, while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the Emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), red beryl (red), goshenite (colorless), heliodor (yellow), and <b>morganite</b> (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species beryl.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Japanese {{took the lead}} in {{manufacturing}} PAN-based carbon fibers. The 1970 joint technology agreement allowed Union Carbide to manufacture the Japan’s Toray Industries product. <b>Morganite</b> decided that carbon-fiber production was peripheral to its core business, leaving Courtaulds as the only big UK manufacturer. Courtelle's water-based inorganic process used to produce it made the product susceptible to impurities that did not affect the organic process used by other carbon-fiber manufacturers. The investment did not generate the anticipated returns, leading Courtaulds ceasing carbon-fiber production in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The Swansea Enterprise Park (Parc Anturiaeth Abertawe) is a {{combined}} business park, retail park and industrial estate in Swansea, Wales. In 1981 {{it became the}} first enterprise zone in the United Kingdom, and the largest. [...] Originally it was named the Swansea Enterprise Zone. The designated area covers parts of the Llansamlet and Morriston wards in the Lower Swansea valley, Wales. The Enterprise Park is the largest commercial district and the largest out-of-town shopping district of Swansea. Major employers at the site include <b>Morganite,</b> Alberto-Culver, Viskase, The Land Registry and Welsh Water.|$|E
50|$|Aquamarine, <b>morganite,</b> tourmaline, {{and other}} gemstones are mined in Zambezia Province; dumortierite, in Tete Province; and garnet, in Niassa Province. The mine output of garnet doubled to an {{estimated}} 4,400 kg in 2006; the increase may have been attributable to upgrades to the Cuamba Mine by Sociedade Mineira de Cuamba E.E. Garnet production was expected to increase by 26% in 2007. The production of dumortierite declined sharply in 2005 because of poor market conditions {{and a lack of}} equipment. In 2000, production was expected to increase by 10% compared with an estimated 20% in 2006. Copper-containing tourmaline was mined from an alluvial deposit in the Alto Ligonha District of Zambezia Province starting in early 2004; the mines were still producing at the end of 2006.|$|E

50|$|Hemmings {{once had}} an {{enormous}} bakery building on land just north of Chadwell Heath station. This building was derelict by the 1970s and was later demolished for housing. For many years Bergermaster Paints maintained a large factory in Freshwater Road. Grove Road was also an industrial area with Wiggins Teape and <b>Morganite</b> Carbons Ltd among companies based there. These sites were sold in the 1990s and have also been redeveloped for housing. A teddy bear factory {{in the same area}} was the site of the alleged murder of Terry 'Teddy Bear' Eve and others in the 1970s. The esoteric publishing company founded by phrenologist L.N. Fowler had a shop and offices in the High Road in the 1970s and 1980s. Dairy Crest is a major employer in the area and Sunlight laundry Sainsbury's, Nicholls and Clarke, and Tesco are also major employers.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{potential}} strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 {{in a process}} developed by W. Watt, L. N. Phillips, and W. Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire. The process was patented by the UK Ministry of Defence, then licensed by the NRDC to three British companies: Rolls-Royce already making carbon fiber, <b>Morganite,</b> and Courtaulds. Within a few years, after successful use in 1968 of a Hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly in the Conways of the Vickers VC10s operated by BOAC, Rolls-Royce {{took advantage of the}} new material's properties to break into the American market with its RB-211 aero-engine with carbon-fiber compressor blades. Unfortunately, the blades proved vulnerable to damage from bird impact. This problem and others caused Rolls-Royce such setbacks that the company was nationalized in 1971. The carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form [...] "Bristol Composites".|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, (Dayana Mendoza of Venezuela) was {{crowned with}} a tiara {{designed}} by Rosalina Lydster of Jewelry by Rosalina and Ms. Dang Thi Kim Lien of CAO Fine Jewelry. The crown, valued at $120,000, {{is made of}} 18-carat white and yellow gold. It is composed of over 1,000 precious stones; including 555 white diamonds (30 carats), 375 cognac diamonds (14 carats), 10 smoky quartz crystals (20 carats) and 19 <b>morganite</b> gemstones (60 carats). The yellow luster of the gold represents the prosperous thriving economy in Vietnam. White, light pink, and cognac are the main hues in the crown which represent inspiration and feeling. Each piece of the crown was designed to represent an important attribute of the Miss Universe Pageant. The curves of inlaid precious stones represent the strong development and potential of each country. The image of the crane (Lac Bird) symbolizes Vietnamese spirit and culture. The image of the heart represents unified breath, rhythm, and vision, which are powerful internal forces that stress faith, hope, and unity. However, Mendoza did not wore this crown and instead wore the Mikimoto designed crown when she crowned her successor/compatriot Stefania Fernandez.|$|E
