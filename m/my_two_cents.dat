40|$|Introduction In {{this issue}} of Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory, Adam Kilgarriff {{discusses}} several issues concerned {{with the role of}} probabilistic modelling and statistical hypothesis testing in the domain of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics. Given the overall importance of these issues to the above-mentioned fields, I felt that the topic merits even more discussion and decided to add <b>my</b> own <b>two</b> <b>cents</b> with the hope that this discussion note triggers further commentaries or even some lively discussion and criticism. The points raised in Kilgarriff's paper are various and important and considerations of space do not allow me to address all of them in as great detail as they certainly deserve. I will therefore concentrate on only one particular aspect of the paper which I find # given my own research history and subjective interests # particularly important, namely the issue of statistical hypothesis testing. More precisely, I will address one of the central clai...|$|R

Kendrick's OD had came out and Q's Setbacks had came out. I had these bodies of work to go off of as references, as inspiration. I hear what Kendrick is talking about, I hear what Q is talking about, I heard what Jay Rock was talking about. So how am I going to piece this all together and add <b>my</b> own <b>two</b> <b>cents,</b> too? How do I continue the sound but have my individuality as an artist? It's the same challenge every single time." [...] Stevens released his first independent album, under Top Dawg Entertainment, exclusively through iTunes on April 5, 2011. The album subsequently peaked at #73 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album, although its title is Longterm Mentality, is not the third part of his Longterm series.|$|R

However, it is also sometimes used ironically when expressing a strongly held opinion. The phrase is also sometimes used out of habit to preface uncontentious opinions. For example: ...|$|E

50|$|KWTV, {{which has}} long been one of CBS' strongest affiliates, has long had a rivalry with KFOR-TV for the most-watched {{newscast}} in the market. It had the highest-rated late evening newscast in the United States during the May 2006 sweeps period, and its 10:00 p.m. newscast was the top-rated newscast {{in the nation in}} May 2007, and in the market during the February 2012 sweeps. KWTV's newscasts vie for first place with KFOR in most news timeslots. Although the Ogle family has long been associated with KFOR-TV dating back to Jack Ogle's arrival as anchor in the 1950s, with Kent and Kevin Ogle now with that station today (although Kevin's daughter, Abigail Ogle, serves as a weekday morning news anchor at KOCO), Kelly Ogle serves as KWTV's weeknight co-anchor and provides an op-ed segment weeknights on the 10:00 p.m. newscast titled <b>My</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Cents.</b> After the FCC imposed the Prime Time Access Rule that cut 30 minutes from the major networks' primetime schedules - reducing them from 3½ hours to three - in 1971, KWTV launched Oklahoma City's first hour-long 6:00 p.m. newscast (predating KFOR-TV's 6:00 p.m. news hour by 25 years). It was split into two half-hour newscasts at 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. in 1976, bookending the 5:30 p.m. airing of the CBS Evening News. From 1966 to 1971, KWTV used the Eyewitness News format later used by ABC affiliate KOCO.|$|E

5000|$|Terry recounted {{once that}} he rode Bodacious for a {{qualified}} ride twice {{and that he}} was bucked off twice in his career. One of the times he got bucked off Bodacious he was sent to the hospital. The 5' 8", 140 lb. West, who is the first and last rider to get a qualified ride, has gotten aboard Bodacious four times. He has scored a ride twice and been bucked off twice. In 1991, when West scored the first ever qualified ride on Bodacious, who was not well known yet, the prize money bore that out, only $181. They met again in 1993, and Bodacious got his revenge, bucking him off and bruising his ribs. Their third meeting was a disaster for West, and Bodacious almost ended him. It was in 1994 at an event in Houston, TX. During the ride, he was not wearing a protective vest. Bodacious exploded off his front feet and more damage was done than a head bashing. Terry received broken ribs, a broken wrist, and a punctured lung. [...] "He didn't want to get on him that night," [...] said West's wife, Michelle, a former barrel rider. [...] "He was saying 'I'm just not going to get on him.' And I said 'Big deal. What's the worst thing that can happen to you? You'll get bucked off?' [...] "Then when he was lying out there, gasping for air, about to pass on, I said to myself 'That's real smart, Michelle. I decided never to put <b>my</b> <b>two</b> <b>cents</b> in from then on.'" [...] However, West did not let his injuries stop him taking on Bodacious again. In 1995, and wearing a protective vest this time, he rode him through to a qualified ride to score 87 points. He earned a much larger amount of $10,000. The score between them was 2-2.|$|E
