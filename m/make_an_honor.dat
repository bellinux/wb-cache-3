40|$|What <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> program <b>a</b> {{community}}? And {{how does}} one build <b>a</b> vibrant <b>honors</b> community at <b>a</b> commuter community college? In the City University of New York’s LaGuardia Community College Honors Program, we have been grappling with such questions especially because ours is an urban, non-residential campus that serves a diverse, non-traditional student population. Our student population is roughly 38 % Hispanic, 21 % Asian, and 20 % Black; in 2007, 58 % of our students were foreign born, 19 % took evening classes, and 46 % were part-time students. How can we provide the program {{with a sense of}} cohesion without the infrastructure of a residential college, and with most of our students holding jobs (part-time or full-time) and/or taking care of family? Furthermore, having no dedicated space, budget, or administrative support for managing the day-to-day affairs of the honors program makes it difficult to sustain an active program, let alone grow it and build <b>an</b> engaged <b>honors</b> community...|$|R

5000|$|It is permissible, {{with the}} bishop's permission, to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> shrine in <b>honor</b> of <b>an</b> {{approved}} revelation.

Only public revelation and the liturgy are obligatory, for they are necessary for salvation.

5000|$|Instead {{of simply}} {{choosing}} stats to assign points to {{as in the}} first three Ultima games, you are instead asked various ethical dilemmas by a Gypsy using remotely tarot-like cards of the eight virtues. These situations do not have one correct resolution; rather, players must rank the eight virtues and whichever stands as their highest priority determines the type of character they will play. For example, choosing Compassion <b>makes</b> you <b>a</b> Bard, <b>Honor</b> <b>a</b> Paladin, Sacrifice a Tinker, and so on. This was also the first Ultima game where you had to play as a human, eliminating other races such as the elves, dwarves, and [...] "bobbits" [...] found in previous games altogether (however, even {{in the first three}} Ultimas where they could be chosen as player characters, there were never any non-player characters of those non-human races).|$|R

5000|$|Readercon is {{an annual}} science fiction convention, held every July in the Boston, Massachusetts area, in Burlington, Massachusetts. It {{was founded by}} Bob Colby and {{statistician}} Eric Van in the mid-1980s [...] {{with the goal of}} focusing almost exclusively on science fiction/fantasy/slipstream/speculative fiction in the written form (on the rare occasion that there is a discussion held about non-written science fiction, it will have a tongue-in-cheek title such as [...] "Our biannual media panel"). Past guests of honor have included authors such as Greer Gilman, Gene Wolfe, Octavia Butler, Samuel R. Delany, Karen Joy Fowler, Brian Aldiss, Nalo Hopkinson, Joe Haldeman, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Peter Straub, and China Miéville, and editors such as Ellen Datlow and David G. Hartwell. The convention also <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> point of <b>honoring</b> <b>a</b> deceased author as the Memorial Guest of Honor. In 2009, for instance, the guests of honor were the living writers Elizabeth Hand and Greer Gilman and the memorial guest of honor was Hope Mirrlees.|$|R
