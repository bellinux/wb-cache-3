40|$|We have {{developed}} measuring system for arc duration time <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> spark, which is fabricated {{to evaluate a}} <b>commutation</b> action <b>of</b> D-C machine quantitavely. The superior features of the developed system are as follows 1) It is enables measuring of the duration time <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> spark all <b>of</b> the commutator segment. 2) Accuracy {{of the system is}} within 0. 1 μs. with 0. 5 ms. commutator period (maximum rotation number). 3) It makes possible the long time automatic measurement. We have measured the duration time <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> arc to JEC- 54 commutation spark number. Findings are: 1) The ratio of frequency distribution has two peaks to the duration time <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> arc. 2) The maximum point of arc duration time in the ratio of frequency distribution increases according to the commutation spark number. 3) Arc duration time depends on brush materials and revoling speed with the same commutation spark number which is measured with eye.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} theory of certain {{partially}} ordered sets that capture the structure <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> classes <b>of</b> words in monoids. As a first application, it follows readily that counting words in commutation classes is #P-complete. We then apply the partially ordered sets to Coxeter groups. Some results are a proof that enumerating the reduced words of elements of Coxeter groups is #P-complete, a recursive formula for computing the number <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> classes <b>of</b> reduced words, as well as stronger bounds on the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> classes than were previously known.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> {{for a pair of}} continuous and convex Hamiltonians, given in terms <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> <b>of</b> their Lax- Oleinik semigroups. This is equivalent to the solvability of an associated multi- time Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We examine the weak KAM theoretic aspects <b>of</b> the <b>commutation</b> property and show that the two Hamiltonians have the same weak KAM solutions and the same Aubry set, thus generalizing a result recently obtained by the second author for Tonelli Hamiltonians. We make a further step by proving that the Hamiltonians admit a common critical subsolution, strict outside their Aubry set. This subsolution can be taken of class C^{ 1, 1 } in the Tonelli case. To prove our main results in full generality, it is crucial to establish suitable differentiability properties of the critical subsolutions on the Aubry set. These latter results are new in the purely continuous case and of independent interest. Comment: 37 pages. Third version. Presentation <b>of</b> the <b>commutation</b> property changed.

40|$|We {{define and}} study {{a notion of}} commutant for V-enriched J-algebraic {{theories}} for a system of arities J, recovering the usual notion of commutant or centralizer of a subring as a special case alongside Wraith's notion of commutant for Lawvere theories {{as well as a}} notion of commutant for V-monads on a symmetric monoidal closed category V. This entails a thorough study <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> and Kronecker products of operations in J-theories. In view of the equivalence between J-theories and J-ary monads we reconcile this notion <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> with Kock's notion <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> <b>of</b> cospans of monads and, in particular, the notion of commutative monad. We obtain notions of J-ary commutant and absolute commutant for J-ary monads, and we show that for finitary monads on Set the resulting notions of finitary commutant and absolute commutant coincide. We examine the relation of the notion of commutant to both the notion of codensity monad and the notion of algebraic structure in the sense of Lawvere...|$|R

The first part provides an introduction into motor control and common used methods of speed and position sensing of brushed DC motor.

These pulses are caused by brushes leaping over the commutator bars. Correct evaluation <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> pulses can provide the information about velocity and position of the motor.

40|$|Abstract—The control <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> <b>of</b> {{switched}} reluctance (SR) motor has nominally {{depended on}} a physical position detector. The physical rotor position sensor limits robustness and increases size and inertia of the SR drive system. The paper describes {{a method to}} overcome these limitations by using magnetization characteristics of the motor to indicate rotor and stator teeth overlap status. The method is using active current probing pulses of same magnitude {{that is used to}} simulate flux linkage in the winding being probed. A microprocessor is used for processing magnetization data to deduce rotor-stator teeth overlap status and hence rotor position. However, the back-of-core saturation and mutual coupling introduces overlap detection errors, hence that <b>of</b> <b>commutation</b> control. This paper presents the concept of the detection scheme and the effects of backof core saturation.
