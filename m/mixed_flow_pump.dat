50|$|Heilman, {{with several}} Medrad Intec employees, formed VASCOR in 1986 {{to develop an}} implantable left {{ventricular}} assist device or VAD to help patients suffering from advanced heart failure. VASCOR has explored several potential heart assist methods, including devices that would push on the outside surface of a failing left ventricle, using magnetic levitation for supporting a bladed rotor in an axial or <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{and the use of}} a moving valve placed in series with the heart's failing left ventricle. Finding none of these approaches fully satisfactory, VASCOR has settled on a unique method for using a failsafe counter-pulsation heart assist device powered by a transcutaneous electrical transmission system or TETS. The TETS eliminates driveline infections, a common adverse event experience with existing heart assist devices. The TETS technology has been found fully satisfactory in animal testing and pump animal testing is expected in 2016. Avoiding the spinning rotor of the now commonly used rotary pumps eliminates the associated blood shear with its blood shear related clotting and bleeding complications.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{performance}} and radial {{force of a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> with symmetrical and unsymmetrical tip clearance are investigated in this paper. As the tip clearance increases, the pump head and efficiency both decrease. The center of the radial force on the principal axis {{is located at the}} coordinate origin when the tip clearance is symmetrical, and moves to the third quadrant when the tip clearance is unsymmetrical. Analysis results show that the total radial force on the principal axis is closely related to the fluctuation of mass flow rate in each single flow channel. Unsteady simulations show that the dominant frequencies of radial force on the hub and blade correspond to the blade number, vane number, or double blade number because of the rotor stator interaction. The radial force on the blade pressure side decreases with the tip clearance increase because of leakage flow. The unsymmetrical tip clearances in an impeller induce uneven leakage flow rate and then result in unsymmetrical work ability of each blade and flow pattern in each channel.

40|$|Measurements of {{impeller}} speed, {{power consumption}} and gas holdup were combined with visual {{observations of the}} extent of gas dispersion and particle suspension in three phase systems for a wide size range of fully baffled, agitated vessels (tank diameters from 0. 29 to 1. 83 m). Several common impeller geometries were examined and a minimum mixing condition with regard to gas dispersion was specified for each type. Where the impeller had previously been characterized (e. g. the six-bladed disc turbine) in gas-liquid systems, this minimum condition coincided with those generally accepted in the literature. The minimum mixing condition with regard to particle suspension was taken to be when no particle remained at rest on the base for more than one to two seconds. A system was defined as efficiently mixed when both gas dispersion and particle suspension criteria were. simultaneously satisfied for the minimum power input. The effect of well-suspended particles on the gas-liquid hydrodynamics in the vessel was negligible, but if large quantities of particles were settled out on the vessel base, gas dispersion was affected. On the other hand, aeration had an adverse influence on particle suspension, and increased impeller speeds and powers were necessary to maintain the particles in the just-suspended state if the system was sparged with gas. Consequently the result of aerating a system which was operating at the ungassed just-suspended condition was sedimentation of the solids. The severity of this sedimentation was dependent on impeller geometry, and at one extreme could result in complete sedimentation of all the solids for a very small change in operating conditions. A qualitative method is presented which gives an indication of the likely extent of sedimentation. Of the impellers investigated, the disc turbine and <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> impeller <b>pumping</b> upwards are shown to provide the most stable and efficient operation at high gas rates.

40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} wall rotating-driven flows is {{the tendency of}} fluid with high angular momentum to be flung radially outward. For a generator, the rotor rotating-driven flow, usually {{referred to as the}} rotating <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> {{plays an important role in}} rotor winding cooling. In this study, three-dimensional numerical analyzes are presented for turbulent <b>pumping</b> <b>flow</b> in the inter-coil rotor cavity and short cooling grooves of a generator. Calculations of the flow field and the mass flux distribution through the grooves were carried out in a sequence of four related cases Under an isothermal condition: (a) <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> which is the self-generated flow resulted from the rotor <b>pumping</b> action; (b) <b>mixing</b> <b>flow,</b> which is the combination of the ventilating <b>flow</b> and <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> under a constant density condition; (c) <b>mixing</b> <b>flow,</b> with density modeled by the ideal gas law; and (d) <b>mixing</b> <b>flow,</b> with different pressure differentials applied on the system.

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} fact that {{quite a number}} of problems faced in a pumping station are related to the design of sump or intake rather than pump design. Head-capacity curves provided by the pump manufacturer are obtained on the condition of no vortices flowing into the pump intake. The efficiency and performance of pumping stations depend not only on the performance of the selected pumps but also on the proper design of the intake sumps. A faulty design of pump sump can lead to the occurrence of swirl and vortices, which reduce the pump performance and induce vibration and additional noise. Therefore, sump model test is necessary to check the flow condition around intake structure. Numerical simulation is a good facility for reducing the time and cost involved throughout the design process. In this study, the commercial software ANSYS CFX- 13. 0 has been used for the CFD analysis of the sump models. In a scaled sump model for air entrainment simulation, numerical analysis of single phase and two-phase with SST turbulence model was carried out to predict vortex (both free surface vortex and submerged vortex) occurrence and location. The effectiveness of curtain walls and square bars to eliminate the free surface vortex is evaluated. Meanwhile, the experiment including PIV system was performed in KMOU to investigate the flow conditions around pump intake structure. In a full size sump model, overall numerical analysis for the sump model with a <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> installed was carried out. Hydraulic performances of the <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> for head rise, shaft power, pump efficiencies versus flow rate changed from 50 % to 140 % of the design flow rate were studied by the performance curves. A trident shaped anti vortex device (AVD) composed of three wall fillets and one center splitter was installed under the pump intake. The effectiveness of the AVD for the suppression of submerged vortex was evaluated. In addition, numerical simulation of cavitation phenomenon in the <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> has been performed by calculating the full cavitation model with k-琯 turbulence model. According to the results, details of the location, size and strength of vortices were predicted in the numerical simulation. For the scaled sump model, although there is a little difference between the single phase and two-phase simulation, all the results predict the free surface vortex and submerged vortex formation and location. The CFD simulations of flow condition show good agreement with the PIV results. The effectiveness of curtain walls installed to inhibit the free surface vortex is confirmed in the CFD resultswhile the square bars installed in the channel failed to suppress the free surface vortex. For the <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> with sump, the best efficiency point (BEP) is at the design flow rate with the corresponding efficiency of 89. 6 %. The effectiveness of AVDs installed for the submerged vortex is confirmed by comparisons of the sump model with and without AVD results. Cavitation phenomenon analysis shows the pump operating at the BEP condition has a considerable extent over the requirement of cavitation performance. With numerical simulation, the inception of cavitation in the blade passage is observed on the suction surface where the leading edges meet the tips, and then as the inlet total pressure decrease, the cavitation zone is spread out over the suction surface as well as {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blade.

Consequently, the modifications of spiral case and pump suction area were made based on the knowledge of flow conditions and the shape of dissipation function. The primary design of pump geometry was created as the base model serving for the comparison of individual modification influences. The basic experimental data are available for this geometry. This approach replaced the more complicated and with respect to convergence of all computational tasks more difficult calculation for the compressible liquid flow. The modification of primary pump consisted in inserting the three fins types. Subsequently, the evaluation of pressure pulsations, specific energy curves and visualization of velocity fields were chosen as the criterion for successful design. Keywords—CFD, radiaxial pump, spiral case, stability...|$|E
