40|$|We analyze {{ground-state}} {{properties of}} strictly one-dimensional molecular matter comprised of identical particles of mass m. Such {{a class of}} systems can be described by an additive two-body potential whose functional form is common to all substances which only differ in the energy ϵ and range l scales of the potential. With this choice De Boer's quantum theorem of corresponding states holds thus implying that ground-state properties expressed in appropriate reduced form are only determined by the dimensionless parameter λ_ 0 ^ 2 ∼ħ^ 2 /ml^ 2 ϵ measuring the strength of zero-point motion in the system. The presence of a minimum in the two-body interaction potential leads to a many-body bound state which is a Luttinger liquid. As λ_ 0 increases, the asymmetry of the two-body potential causes quantum expansion, softening, and eventual evaporation of the Luttinger liquid into a gas phase. Selecting the pair interaction potential in the Morse form we analytically compute {{the properties of the}} Luttinger liquid and its range of existence. As lambda_ 0 increases, the system first undergoes a discontinuous evaporation transition into a diatomic gas followed by a continuous dissociation transition into a <b>monoatomic</b> <b>gas.</b> In particular we find that spin-polarized isotopes of hydrogen and He- 3 are monoatomic gases, He- 4 is a diatomic gas, while molecular hydrogen and heavier substances are Luttinger liquids. We also investigate the effect of finite pressure on the properties of the liquid and <b>monoatomic</b> <b>gas</b> phases. In particular we estimate a pressure at which molecular hydrogen undergoes an inverse Peierls transition into a metallic state which is a one-dimensional analog of the transition predicted by Wigner and Huntington in 1935.

40|$|The Boltzmann {{equation}} is an integro-differential equation which describes the density {{function of the}} distribution of the velocities of the molecules of dilute <b>monoatomic</b> <b>gases</b> under the assumption that the energy is only transferred via collisions between the molecules. In 1956 Kac studied the Boltzmann equation and defined a property of the density function that he called the "Boltzmann property" which describes the behavior of the density function at a given fixed time as the number of particles tends to infinity. The Boltzmann property has been studied extensively since then, and now it is simply called chaos, or Kac's chaos. On the other hand, in ergodic theory, chaos usually refers to the mixing properties of a dynamical system as time tends to infinity.

For this purpose, we employ a canonical ensemble of classical <b>monoatomic</b> ideal <b>gas</b> inside a box in a Rindler spacetime. The total energy decreases monotonically {{with the increase of}} the external gravity representing its attractiveness. It is however bounded below, which is {{different from that of the}} Newtonian gravity case. As for the entropy, it decreases with the external gravity in the Newtonian regime. However, in the presence of strong gravity or ultra-relativistic high temperature, the entropy increases with the gravity. This result can be a resolution of the negative entropy problem of the ideal gas in the Newtonian gravity. In the presence of strong gravity, the bottom of the box is very close to the event horizon of the Rindler spacetime mimicking a blackhole and the gas behaves as if it is on an effective two dimensional surface located at the bottom of the box.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{for the first}} time a subtle chemical change in the oxidation state of Zn at the interface between a ZnO thin film and a glass substrate using gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) depth-profiling. A combination of <b>monoatomic</b> and <b>gas</b> clusters was used for etching, allowing the removal of the surface rapidly using the monoatomic ion beam yet still yield a less damaged surface by removing the damaged layer using the argon GCIB as a final step. With this combined method, the depth-profile shows the transition of Zn from oxide to metal at the interface, which the monoatomic ion source if used alone would damage. This data indicates that the initial layers of the film did not undergo as much oxidation during the deposition compared with the rest of the film; therefore, metallic zinc resulted at the interface. We also examined the ZnO thin film under a range of conditions of argon ion profiling from monoatomic to cluster ions to study the most efficient method for depth-profiling of multiple layers of inorganic materials. The monoatomic ion beam does not show the transition phenomena at the interface, which was observed in cluster depth-profiling, probably because of atomic mixing effects. This suggests that care be taken in selection of etch parameters when studying interfaces. We recommend the combination of monoatomic sputtering followed by GCIB etching as the most efficient method for looking at interfaces of inorganic thin layers from the point of view of time taken and minimising damage at interface.
