Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E

Rosalie Cadron-Jetté died shortly thereafter, during {{the early hours of}} April 5, 1864. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix. Around 2 a.m. she <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the cross and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus!

Her statement implicated a seventh person, Thomas Brown, as being involved as a witch; Brown was charged and incarcerated in the tolbooth but did not confess {{to any of the}} allegations. He died of starvation, a common occurrence among suspected witches who, like Brown, were confined for lengthy times. Confessions were obtained from Cornfoot and Lawson with Cornfoot later adding that the Devil had visited her while she was imprisoned.

2500|$|The gradobranitelj in Bukor in the 1950s was Trivun Selenić. Perceiving {{that there}} might be hail, he would go behind the village, wave his arms toward the cloud, and speak the {{following}} (the meaning of the italicized words is unclear): [...] "Raviše đaviše, nađuniši pistols, the dress on silver, the girl onto the neck! Barbarian's head smashed! I am the first voivode here. The dinner is not served for you here. Go there to those hills. It is served there for you. So dine there." [...] Trivun explained that hail clouds were led by devils accompanied by souls of the drowned and hanged. By the statement [...] "I am the first voivode here" [...] he would proclaim that he was the principal commander of devils, who consequently had to obey his commands and proceed around his village. Trivun recognized that all this was a sin: both his declaring himself a voivode of devils, and averting hail from his village, because it would fall and make damage at some other place. Miljko Ivković from Dobrići spoke nothing, but went onto the field, took his cap off, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Cross, and put the cap back on. After that, he three times <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the cross with a knife {{in the direction of the}} cloud, thus cutting it into quarters, which he then drove apart.

2500|$|Like the Epistle of Barnabas, Justin saw the stretched-out {{hands of}} Moses {{in the battle}} against Amalek as foreshadowing the cross of Jesus: [...] "If he gave up any part of this sign, which was an {{imitation}} of the cross (σταυρός), the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the cross (σταυρός).

According to The Passion of the Holy Martyr Gobron, the Georgian commander who was stubbornly refusing Yusuf's proposal, was ordered to bow down for execution. After the first strike of the sword, Gobron <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the cross with blood on his forehead and exclaimed, [...] "I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, that you have accounted me, the most contemptible and chief among sinners, worthy to lay down my life for your sake!". The enraged Muslim general ordered {{the rest of the}} men to be massacred and their bodies left to the wild beasts. Despite securing the hard-earned castle of Q'ueli, the Sajids were forced to evacuate Tao-Klarjeti due to increasing Georgian power in the west.

They explained that the man was swimming in the river when he was attacked by a [...] "water beast" [...] which mauled him and dragged him underwater. Although they tried to rescue him in a boat, he was dead. Columba sent a follower, Luigne moccu Min, to swim across the river.

2500|$|However, legends {{surrounding}} Saint Francis of Assisi {{show him}} befriending a wolf. According to the Fioretti, {{the city of}} Gubbio was besieged by the Wolf of Gubbio, which devoured both livestock and men. Francis of Assisi, who was living in Gubbio at the time took pity on the townsfolk, and went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, but the saint pressed on and when he found the wolf he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one.

[...] "All these people accuse you and curse you… But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people." [...] Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens he made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had [...] "done evil out of hunger" [...] the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly, and in return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis, ever the lover of animals, even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again.|$|E
