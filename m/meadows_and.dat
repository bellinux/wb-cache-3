30|$|The biomass of M. glareolus was {{significantly}} lower in the meadow than in the young forest (t =  2.06, P <  0.05) and advanced forest (t =  3.97, P <  0.001). The biomass of M. arvalis in the <b>meadow</b> <b>and</b> young forest did not differ significantly, but it was lower in the advanced forest (t =  2.61, P =  0.012 compared with the <b>meadow,</b> <b>and</b> t =  2.17, P <  0.05 compared with the young forest).

5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River.

The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> parklands, while not as prolific as the <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, <b>meadows,</b> <b>and</b> savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils. Because the phreatic table {{is very close}} to the surface, soils hardly freeze in winter and drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. This animal was introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th century, Canterbury {{went into}} decline and its Roman {{institutions}} and buildings crumbled, although {{the city walls}} survived. In 597, Augustine was sent to Kent by Pope Gregory I to convert the local population to Christianity. Augustine established Canterbury Cathedral within the city, possibly because the walled site gave them additional protection or because it was symbolically important as a former Roman city. Canterbury, now called Cantwaraburh, prospered and its population and trade increased. Much of the land within the walls had become water <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> farmland, and an palisade may have built around the cathedral and its precinct to form a secure inner stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Further south, in Victoria and New South Wales, {{rainfall}} {{is spread}} more evenly {{throughout the year}} and the driest season lasts from December to May. At this time, southern populations congregate in inland flocking areas which include upland marshes, the edges of reservoirs and lakes, pastures and agricultural land. When rain arrives in June and July, they disperse to the coastal freshwater marshes, shallow lakes, wet <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> other wetlands where they breed.|$|E

5|$|High Lakes Trail #116, the namesake of the Midway High Lakes Area, {{crosses the}} {{relatively}} flat {{area on the}} north side of the mountain following a trail the Yakama Native Americans used for picking huckleberries. Like many other trails around Adams, this trail has spectacular views of the mountain. Other trails, like the Takh Takh Meadows Trail #136, pass through picturesque <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> old lava flows. One of the longest trails on the Gifford Pinchot, Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} junction, NY22 begins a long curve {{away from the}} state line that has it running due west {{at the end of}} NY40 in North Granville. It heads {{northwest}} a little further until, after passing between Great <b>Meadows</b> <b>and</b> Washington state prisons, it reaches US4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US4, one of the few along Route22 that pairs it with another north–south route, lasts for seven miles (11km) along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E

5|$|NY17A begins {{just south}} of NY17 exit124 {{in the village of}} Goshen. At the traffic light with the {{southern}} on-ramp from NY17 eastbound, NY207 becomes NY17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> farmland until it reaches the small village of Florida, where NY94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border. The concurrent roads then become Florida's main street.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both {{temporally}} and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} that they are able to spend foraging.|$|E

5|$|The {{species are}} native to <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the Isle of Wight, England. The Isle of Wight is {{an island}} and county three miles off the south coast of England in the English Channel. Its geology is complex, with a chalk downland ridge running east to west through its centre and {{important}} fossil beds from the Lower Cretaceous to the Lower Tertiary around the coast. This geology gives rise to many distinct habitats, with strong maritime influences, including chalk grassland, neutral <b>meadows,</b> <b>and</b> broad-leaved woodland. The Isle of Wight has a population of 140,000, {{making it one of the}} country's smaller counties in terms of population.|$|E
