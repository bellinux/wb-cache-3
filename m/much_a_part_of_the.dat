5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E

25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K. Balagopal, Kashmiris have a {{distinct}} sense of identity and this identity is certainly not irreligious, as Islam is very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity that Kashmiris feel strongly for. He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, {{because there is no}} national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both can guarantee existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E

25|$|Mainly on {{the basis}} of their reunion {{behaviours}} (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, {{the goal}} was to produce an album that was [...] "very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Carnival, without it being the seventh Joker's Card". Bang! Pow! Boom! was the first album to focus on this concept since Hell's Pit. The album was later {{revealed}} to be the first Joker's Card of a [...] "second deck." [...] Bang! Pow! Boom! is a character within the Dark Carnival which Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps {{his way through the crowd}} blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell". The album features a series of skits in which rednecks, pedophiles, and husbands who abuse their wives receive phone calls inviting them to the Dark Carnival, where they are promised US$100,000 for arriving.|$|E

The archaeological and textual evidence implies, states Thomas Coburn, that the Goddess had become as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu tradition, as God, by about {{the third or fourth}} century. The literature on Shakti theology grew in ancient India, climaxing {{in one of the most}} important texts of Shaktism called the Devi Mahatmya. This text, states C. Mackenzie Brown – a professor of Religion, is both a culmination of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine feminine, as well as a foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the feminine transcendence in centuries that followed. The Devi-Mahatmya is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states Thomas B. Coburn – a professor of Religious Studies, but [...] "it is surely the earliest in which the object of worship is conceptualized as Goddess, with a capital G".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{felt that}} the chronological running order put more {{emphasis}} on the band's well-regarded earlier periods. [...] "The selection of songs perhaps indicates Garbage view their career the same way many fans do", wrote Victoria Durham of Rock Sound, and [...] "that they never quite managed [...] the brilliance of their early work." [...] Johnny Dee of Classic Rock expressed, [...] "The later material here sounds formulaic, however, new song [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] adds strings to the dynamic and sits well alongside their peerless early material". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that despite ignoring 2000s singles such as [...] "Run Baby Run", [...] "it already seems that the comp has lingered far longer than necessary on the last stage of Garbage's career", {{in contrast to the}} debut album singles [...] "still sounding sleek and alluring." [...] Kerrang! magazine's Tom Byrant also felt that Garbage's work had dated, expounding, [...] "Something that was once so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zeitgeist has remained rooted to the era it marked, untranslatable across the millennial divide. Still, songs like 'Stupid Girl' and 'Only Happy When It Rains' [...] maintain an urgency and spite that sees their intent remain intact." [...] Billboard writer Kerri Mason praised the choice of remixes on the special edition: [...] "the band continually brought the best of dance's best producers, not one of the thirteen tracks is a throwaway." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called the compilation a [...] "deserved retrospective", further noting that [...] "the best way to get to know Garbage is through their albums, which demonstrate their strength in depth. In particular the self-titled debut and Version 2.0 withstand a heavy hammering on any stereo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with many}} other young artists, Salmon {{believed}} that his artistic future lay in the United States.

2500|$|During his day of solo {{flying around}} the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although {{it has been}} said that [...] "not since Adam has any human known such solitude", Collins felt very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission. In his {{autobiography}} he wrote that [...] "this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two".

2500|$|Brian Eno {{observed}} the band's jam sessions during the rehearsals, calling them [...] "extraordinary pieces of music appearing out of nowhere". He considered these pieces of [...] "raw material" [...] {{to be as}} <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's work as the songs that would have eventually grown out of them. Thus, he suggested to the band {{that in addition to}} recording Laid, he would also record and produce the band's jam sessions during the same sessions for a separate album, so that the band would be recording two albums concurrently: Laid, the album of [...] "structured" [...] songs, and Wah Wah, the album of improvisations.

2500|$|According to jazz {{historian}} Al Rose, {{the popular}} {{image of an}} early 20th-century saloon pianist being flashily dressed with arm garters {{was inspired by the}} way Tony Jackson used to dress while performing. [...] Sleeve garters are still worn not only by pianists who play ragtime and other turn of the 20th century American music, but also by Dixieland banjo players and many other types of musicians who perform music of that general period. Because sleeve garters are very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costume of contemporary barbershop music performance, an activity for which unimpeded manual dexterity does not play a vital role, the association between sleeve garters and the contemporary performance of turn of the 20th century music may {{have more to do with}} evoking the fashion of the era than with utility or a tradition begun at some later time.|$|E
