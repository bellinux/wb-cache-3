5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported <b>missing,</b> <b>her</b> body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5|$|Beth asks Mick to {{help her}} friend Morgan find her stolen cameras. When he meets her, Mick is {{completely}} shocked; Morgan is identical to his ex-wife, Coraline. He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human. Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did. When alone, Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her as a little girl when she was kidnapped. Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline, the lady who kidnapped her as a child, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake, narrowly <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> heart, not realizing that she has become human. Coraline goes to hospital, but recovers and leaves after being revealed to be a vampire again. Beth's boyfriend Josh is kidnapped by a dangerous Los Angeles–based gang. Mick and Beth witness the event and drive after him, but Josh is shot. Beth realizes that Josh is dying, and begs Mick to turn him into a vampire; he refuses and Josh dies. While putting Josh's affairs in order, Beth discovers that Josh was about to propose to her.|$|E

25|$|According to Decca Records {{producer}} Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only {{hinted at}} Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that {{her voice was}} best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley {{tried to get her}} to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.|$|E
25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went <b>missing,</b> <b>her</b> father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E

25|$|Natalie's parents {{separated}} {{early in}} her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, {{but she had been}} closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, 14-year-old Charlotte was {{enrolled}} {{at the school of}} Miss Wooler in Roe Head, Mirfield. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in Keighley nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation and he remembered the building which he passed when strolling around the parishes of Kirklees, Dewsbury, and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage. Patrick's choice of school was excellent – Charlotte was happy there and studied well. She made many lifelong friends, in particular Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor who later went to New Zealand before returning to England. Charlotte returned from Roe Head in June 1832, <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> friends, but happy to rejoin her family.|$|E
25|$|An {{examination}} of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparing it to {{the force of a}} car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds related to the bone fractures, {{as if they had been}} subjected to a high level of pressure. However, major external injuries were found on Dubinina, who was <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone; she also had extensive skin maceration on the hands. It was claimed that Dubinina was found lying face down in a small stream that ran under the snow and that her external injuries were in line with putrefaction in a wet environment, and were unlikely to be related to her death.|$|E

25|$|On September 23, Marissa and Bianca {{received}} {{a text message}} that they believed was from Scott who invited them to {{a party at the}} Chandler mansion to celebrate the resurrection of Stuart Chandler who had been presumed dead for two years until he was revealed to be alive as a part of Project Orpheus. They attended the party and enjoyed celebrating life in Pine Valley when JR, in a drunken rage, shot into the crowd. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that Marissa died and that {{she was the one who}} JR shot. Marissa's father, David, tried to stop JR from pulling the trigger, but the gun misfired. David then threw JR to the floor and shot him and as a result, JR lapsed into a five-year-long coma. David was arrested and jailed for the incident but later returned to Pine Valley after being paroled. Bianca is seen visiting Marissa's grave and updating Marissa on her son AJ and Miranda, whom they had planned to raise together. Bianca tells Marissa that they were supposed to be together and that she will never stop <b>missing</b> <b>her.</b> After JR awakens from his coma, Bianca becomes upset when she sees him, going into a fit of grief and attacking him for killing Marissa. Bianca leaves Pine Valley telling everyone she is going away for work, but she is shown visiting her sister Kendall, who appears to be ill.|$|E
25|$|Although ranked world No. 7, Williams was seeded {{second at}} the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. This {{was the first}} time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to world No. 10, Serena was seeded first at Wimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where she was {{defeated}} by 13th-seeded Sharapova in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the 2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her world ranking of eleven. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion. That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at the China Open, defeating US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final. Williamses successful season allowed her to qualify for the WTA Tour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva and Anastasia Myskina and lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage. After winning her semifinal, she lost to Sharapova in the final, where she suffered an abdominal injury. Williams finished 2004 ranked world No. 7, but did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first season since 2001.|$|E

Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, {{one of which is}} about <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> brother Austin.

500|$|Although {{the first}} season {{primarily}} deals {{with the murder of}} Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and the murder is resolved in [...] "Leave It to Beaver", another arc running throughout the season is the story of Veronica's mysterious rape a year earlier. At that time, Veronica went to a party at a wealthy student, Shelly's, house. There, she was slipped a mysterious drink, and the next thing she knew, she woke up in an unidentified bed <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> underwear", indicating that she had been raped.

500|$|The reappearance of storylines left {{dangling}} {{at the end}} of {{the first}} season was noted with approval by Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News and VanDerWerff, who both mentioned not only the big one about Quinn and Puck and baby Beth but also Artie's love of directing, and variously added Rachel and Shelby, and movement on the Will and Emma relationship. The fact that Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley, however, was greeted with derision by both reviewers—Urban called it [...] "mind-bogglingly idiotic"—and others as well. Reiter found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, this is about as realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University." [...] Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of [...] "Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because she was <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> daughter grow up" [...] to take a part-time job in Lima as [...] "ridiculous", and the whole scenario as [...] "more than a little bizarre".|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to {{hitchhike}} to a dance class after <b>missing</b> <b>her</b> bus. He again drove to a remote area, brandishing a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside (Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint) where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her. He subsequently packed her body {{into the trunk of}} his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, [...] "admiring [...] catch like a fisherman," [...] and returned to his apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sex with the corpse before dismemberment and disposal of her remains in a similar manner as the previous two victims. Aiko's mother, Skaidrite Rubene Koo, called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information as to her daughter's whereabouts, but did not receive one word in response regarding her missing daughter's location or status.|$|E

A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly <b>missing</b> <b>her.</b> She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.|$|E
