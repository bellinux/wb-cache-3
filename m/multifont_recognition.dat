Specht introduced a special class of Probabilistic Neural Networks which were unnoticed in the computational practice due to their extremely large computer memory requirement. In this note we present and discuss results of experiments assessing the usability of Probabilistic Neural Networks to the <b>multifont</b> <b>recognition</b> problem for large size of the training set...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general {{structure of a}} full automated document analysis system for printed documents. The system {{is based on a}} character preclassification stage which reduces the number of patterns to recognize and introduces a new contextual processing. This specific approach for multifont printed documents reading is based on pattern character redundancies. With the study of prototype pattern instead of characters, we can extract reliable contextual information on the entire text. This statistical information is used to check hypotheses given by the <b>multifont</b> <b>recognition</b> stage. We shall describe the system organization and particularly the preclassification stage, then we shall give some results on recent documents...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOptical Character Recognition (OCR) is {{the process}} of {{translating}} images of text into a comprehensible machine format. Generally, an OCR system is composed of binariza-tion, segmentation and recognition stages. Given an extracted binary character, the recognition stage ensures its description and decides its corresponding ASCII code. In this paper, we propose a new OCR system that aims to high speed, Multiscale and <b>Multifont</b> character <b>recognition.</b> Our proposal is based essentially on robust description using a new Unified Character Descriptor (UCD). In addition, a character type-face and font-size recognition is performed to choose the adequate template for faster matching process. Obtained OCR Accuracy of our proposed System is 1. 5 x higher then that reached by Tesseract on the LRDE dataset...|$|R

As a way or enhancing system performance, typographical information is extracted and used for font identification before actual character recognition is performed.

The font identification is based on decision trees where the characters are automatically arranged differently in confusion classes according to the physical characteristics of fonts. The character recognizers are built around the first and second order hidden Markov models (HMM) as well as Euclidean distance measures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a robust <b>multifont</b> {{character}} <b>recognition</b> system for degraded documents such as photocopy or fax is described. The system {{is based on}} Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using discrete and hybrid modeling techniques, where the latter makes use of an information theory-based neural network. The presented recognition results refer to the SEDAL-database of English documents using no dictionary. It is also demonstrated that the usage of a language model, that consists of character n-grams yields significantly better recognition results. Our resulting system clearly outperforms commercial systems and leads to further error rate reductions compared to previous results reached on this database. 1. Introduction During the last years, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs, see [7]) have been used not only for speech recognition but also for on- and off-line handwriting recognition (for example [2, 8]). However, the greatest advantage of HMMtechnologies, the possibility of segmentation-free recognit [...] ...|$|R
