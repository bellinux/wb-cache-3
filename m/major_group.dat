5|$|Apicomplexa is a <b>major</b> <b>group</b> of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes {{that encompasses}} several important parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Three species are {{known from the}} marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of which cause the economically significant disease coccidiosis in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes species that are pathogenic in humans and pigs.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next <b>major</b> <b>group</b> of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first <b>major</b> <b>group</b> of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E

5|$|Malaysians {{observe a}} number of {{holidays}} and festivities throughout the year. Some are federally gazetted public holidays and some are observed by individual states. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each <b>major</b> <b>group</b> has been declared a public holiday. The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating {{the independence of the}} Federation of Malaya in 1957. Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963. Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June).|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last <b>major</b> <b>group</b> the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|Most of Australia's public {{collections}} {{hold one}} or more works by Makinti, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. She participated in some <b>major</b> <b>group</b> exhibitions, such as Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Colour Power at the National Gallery of Victoria, as well as having had {{a small number of}} solo exhibitions at private galleries, including the gallery of influential art dealer Gabrielle Pizzi. The National Portrait Gallery in Canberra has in its collection a photographic portrait of Kumentje, by Malaysian-born Australian artist Hari Ho.

Krause and colleagues could not exclude the possibility that TNM02067 represents an early member of such a group or an otherwise unknown <b>major</b> <b>group</b> of mammals. However, only two groups of Mesozoic mammals resemble TNM02067: gondwanatheres; and multituberculates in the superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea and Taeniolabidoidea. Djadochtatherioids and taeniolabidoids occur in the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of the northern continents (Laurasia), and gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group of uncertain evolutionary affinities, are known from the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of Gondwana, with forms such as Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica (both from Argentina), Lavanify (Madagascar), and Bharattherium (India).|$|E

25|$|Another <b>major</b> <b>group,</b> {{inhabitants}} {{who follow}} Eastern Orthodox Christianity, practised chiefly by the Russian minority, and the Russian Orthodox Church {{is the second}} largest denomination with 150,000 members. The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, under the Greek-Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate, claims another 20,000 members. Thus, the number of adherents of Lutheranism and Orthodoxy, without regard to citizenship or ethnicity, is roughly equal. Catholics have their Latin Apostolic Administration of Estonia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} pattern {{or group of}} jawless fish with exoskeletons or plated armour, was the Laurentian group, which existed during the Cambrian-Ordovician time. However, the thelodonts (as well as the conodonts, placoderms, acanthodians, and chondrichthyans) are the second <b>major</b> <b>group</b> which are {{believed}} to have emerged in the middle Ordovician and lasted near the Late Devonian period. Due to their similar characteristics and chronological time frame of existence, many believe the thelodonts have Laurentian origins.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another <b>major</b> <b>group</b> of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
