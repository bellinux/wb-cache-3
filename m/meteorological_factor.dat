Retrospective study of pairs covered the period from January 2003 to January 2006.

The surrounding mountains average 2000 ft to nearly 11000 ft elevation. These high elevations mean cooler air - a temperature drop of [...] for every 1000 ft feet of altitude gain. The heavy cold air that collects between the high peaks during the night drains off the heights much like water, joining cold moist air from the Santa Margarita River Channel to meander through the Temecula Valley, creating a double cooling effect. As a result, nighttime lows in and around Temecula are very cool. The cool nighttime temperatures are critical in developing high quality grapes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The respirable {{particulate}} matter (RPM; PM 10) and total suspended {{particulate matter}} (TSP) concentrations in ambient air in Tuticorin, India, were preliminarily estimated. Statistical analyses on so-generated database were performed to infer frequency distributions and to identify dominant <b>meteorological</b> <b>factor</b> affecting the pollution levels. Both the RPM and TSP levels were well below the permissible limits set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As expected, lognormal distribution always fit the data during the study period. However, fit with the normal was also acceptable except for very few seasons. The RPM concentrations ranged between 20. 9 and 198. 2 μg/m 3, while the TSP concentrations varied from 51. 5 to 333. 3 μg/m 3 during the study period. There was a better correlation between PM 10 – 100 and TSP concentrations than that of PM 10 (RPM) and TSP concentrations, but the correlation of RPM fraction was also acceptable.
