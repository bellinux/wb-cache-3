50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are used to}} harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder.

40|$|Phthalates are organic {{lipophilic}} compounds {{which are}} mainly used as plasticizer {{to increase the}} flexibility of plastic polymers. Human exposure occurs mainly via food ingestion and can cause {{a wide range of}} negative health effects (e. g. disruption of the endocrine system). Phthalates are not only present in food because of environmental contamination, but also as a result of migration from packaging and contact materials (e. g. conveyor belts). This study investigates the phthalate contamination in cow milk at farm level. The levels of eight phthalates (DMP, DEP, DiBP, DBP, BBP, DEHP, DCHP and DNOP) were determined in raw milk samples collected from five farms in an area around the city of Mol in ‘The Kempen’ in Flanders (Belgium). Both manually obtained milk samples as milk samples obtained by milking machines were collected. Analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron impact ionisation. The phthalate concentrations in the raw milk samples were compared with each other {{in order to determine the}} contamination pathways for cow milk at farm level. The analysis of the milk samples milked by machine revealed a difference in total phthalate level between the different farms, ranging from 90. 6 to 1065. 1 µg/kg fat (results of the summer sampling period). While comparing milk samples from the same farm, lower total phthalate levels were found in the milk samples milked by hand than those by machine (e. g. 90. 2 versus 174. 4 µg/kg fat). DEHP which is the most commonly used plasticizer worldwide, was the most dominating phthalate in all the milk samples.

Introduction: During {{the last}} fifty years the dairy {{industry}} has developed so rapidly that it is now {{regarded as one of the}} chief sources of revenue for the modern farmer. This is due largely to the ever increasing number of dairy machines and appliances, as well as improved methods of breeding and feeding, a more thorough knowledge of the intricate details in the production of sanitary dairy products and the business ability of the dairyman as displayed in creating and maintaining desirable markets. As a good dairy is a constant source of revenue, maximum production at the minimum cost has ever been the goal toward which the dairy farmer has been constantly striving. Many appliances and machines have been perfected, which have completely revolutionized the dairy business. The value of the Babcock tester, milk separator and pasteurizer can scarcely be estimated; they are absolutely essential to the complete modern dairy. Although inventors have been very successful along this line, yet the difficulties have been almost insurmountable in the creation of an efficient sanitary appliance for drawing milk from the cow's udder. Milking machines or appliances may be classified under three heads: (1). The <b>milking</b> <b>tube.</b> (2). Pressure machines operated by springs and levers. (3). Machines which extract the milk by means of pressure and suction combined. For a long time straws have been inserted into the main duct of cows' teats to draw out the milk, but they were often the cause of injury to the udder and a source of contamination of the milk. One of the first tubes placed on the market was invented by George of New York in 1878, and consisted of a teat tube or tubes having a number of small holes through which the milk entered and a flaring end for increasing the flow of milk without unduly stretching the teat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{instrument}} specifications {{given in}} current international (ISO) and national (ASAE) standards state that measured values should be within 90 % {{of the true}} amplitude of vacuum change at the various locations in the milking machine. Recommendations are given for the minimum sampling rate and response rate of instruments used to measure vacuum changes for dry, wet, milking–time, and cleaning–time tests. These minimum performance requirements should ensure that the measurement accuracy stated in the ISO and ASAE standards are met. A simple method was developed to measure the response rate of a vacuum recording system. The method can be used, quickly and easily, by field or laboratory technicians to specify the response rate of their vacuum recording systems. The predominant effects on response rate of vacuum recording systems are caused by the fittings connecting the electronic vacuum recorder to the measurement point. A major source of measurement error was water or milk in connecting tubes and fittings. Dry and wet tests in the milkline and receiver confirmed previous studies showing {{that the rate of}} vacuum change during dry tests or in dry parts of the milking machine are much lower than those in wet parts of the machine. The fastest vacuum changes were measured in the short <b>milk</b> <b>tube</b> and mouthpiece chamber during a liner slip in a milking–time test. Measurements made in the short <b>milk</b> <b>tube</b> during wet tests corresponded well with those made during wet tests at the teat–end of the ISO standard udder...|$|E
40|$|The vacuum {{variations}} at {{the apex}} of an artificial teat during simulated milking were measured in a factorial-design laboratory test involving six cluster types, two internal diameters (13. 5 mm and 16 mm) of long <b>milk</b> <b>tube</b> (LMT), three water flow rates (4, 6 and 8 l/min), simultaneous (4 × 0) and alternate (2 × 2) pulsation patterns and three pulsator ratios (60, 64, and 68 %). Four of the six clusters were fitted with wide-bore tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete pulsation cycles (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with wide-bore tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a wide-bore tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short <b>milk</b> <b>tube</b> or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. Simultaneous pulsation gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than alternate pulsation for all cluster types. The overall effects of altering pulsator ratio were significant but small in practical terms. There were significant interactions between cluster type and water flow rate and pulsation pattern for TVB, TV, TVM and TVF. peer-reviewedEuropean Unio...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to summarise the best available evidence relating to the nursing management of chest drains. Studies included were those involving hospital patients with a chest drain in situ. A comprehensive and systematic search of the literature was undertaken that included all major databases.

Studies using other methods were also assessed for inclusion in this narrative summary. The findings of this review highlight the lack of research on most aspects of the nursing management of patients with chest drains in situ. RCTs suggest that chest drains remain patent with or without stripping and <b>milking</b> of <b>tubes,</b> but that the total drainage was greater from manipulated tubes.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of a milking system that {{partially}} compensates for milk flow-dependent vacuum loss compared with a standard (high-line) milking unit in a tie-stall barn, milk flow and vacuum patterns were recorded in 10 cows during machine milking with 2 milking systems in a crossover design for 7 d each. Before and after each treatment period postmilking teat condition was recorded by ultrasound cross-sectioning. Additionally, 2 methods to measure teat tissue condition were compared: longitudinal teat ultrasound cross-sectioning and teat tissue density measurements with the spring-loaded caliper (cutimeter method). The partial compensation of milk flow-dependent vacuum loss caused an elevation of the peak flow rate (4. 74 +/- 0. 08 vs. 4. 29 +/- 0. 07 kg/min) and a shorter duration of plateau (1. 57 +/- 0. 06 vs. 1. 96 +/- 0. 07 min) compared with the standard milking system. Total milk yield, duration of incline and decline of milk flow, average milk flow, time until peak flow rate, main milking time, and total milking time did not differ between treatments (overall means: 13. 75 +/- 0. 17 kg; 0. 65 +/- 0. 01 min; 2. 88 +/- 0. 09 min; 2. 82 +/- 0. 05 kg/min; 1. 65 +/- 0. 03 min; 5. 23 +/- 0. 09 min, and 5. 30 +/- 0. 10 min, respectively). The vacuum drop in the short <b>milk</b> <b>tube</b> during periods of high milk flow was less in the compensating vacuum than in the standard milking system (11 +/- 1. 1 vs. 15 +/- 0. 7 kPa). Teat measures as determined by ultrasound remained unchanged over the entire experimental period with both milking systems. Postmilking teat tissue measures including their recovery within 20 min after the end of milking show a correlation (0. 85 and 0. 71, respectively) between the methods used (ultrasound and cutimeter method). In conclusion, a more constant vacuum at the teat tip (within the short <b>milk</b> <b>tube)</b> during periods of high milk flow affected milk flow patterns, mainly increasing peak flow rate. However, the reduced vacuum loss did not increase the overall speed of milking. In addition, effects of higher vacuum stability on teat condition and udder health were not obvious...|$|E

Although with the increasing contact time between the bacteria and the NaOCl (150 ppm), no growth was detected for any of the strains. Concerning the efficiency of NaOCl on total biofilm biomass formation by each S. aureus strain, a decrease was observed when these strains were in contact with 150 ppm NaOCl for a total period of 10 minutes.

40|$|An inordinate {{amount of}} time, money and anguish has been {{invested}} in changing the ways that vacuum is controlled in milking machines. These extraordinary efforts have not resulted in a commensurate improvement in milking performance. There are two fundamental methods of influencing the vacuum in the milking machine: 1) a device to regulate ‘system ’ vacuum, usually located near the receiver and 2) design and configuration of system components to reduce the vacuum difference between the regulated system vacuum and the vacuum at the teat end. The ‘system ’ regulation devices are the primary emphasis in this paper but the influence of components and design will also be covered to put these two contributions to milking vacuum stability in perspective. System regulation devices control the vacuum at a point downstream (in the direction of airflow) of the receiver.

40|$|The {{level of}} the vacuum in machine milking {{is one of the}} {{principal}} parameters which influence the integrity of the tissues and the milk quality.

The clearance apparatus uses a wire with a loop that is magnetically coupled to an external handle to allow the obstructions to be cleared without breaking the sterile environment.

RBCs from the propositus’ parents and brother demonstrated normal CD 55 and CD 59 expression. CONCLUSION: This is the first example of a direct-agglutinating anti-IFC. The cause of the transient depression in CD 55 protein (and thus Cromer system antigens) and appearance of anti-IFC remains unknown, as does the relationship between the patient’s GI system abnormalities and these serologic findings...|$|R
40|$|When pepsin {{is added}} to milk a gradual rise in {{viscosity}} takes place until the milk begins to clot. A quantitative expression for the rennet activity of pepsin can thus be given {{in terms of the}} increase in viscosity of the milk solution (1). The viscosity method is sufficiently precise and can be conveniently used in all cases of dotting of milk or blood where the visible dotting follows a gradual increase in the viscosity of the fluid. When chymo-trypsin {{is added to}} milk a slight, gradual drop in the viscosity of the milk takes place; there is no increase in viscosity until the beginning of clotting when the viscosity rises very rapidly and the solution suddenly sets to a solid gel. This is shown in Fig. 1. The abrupt solidification of milk by chymo-trypsin enables the exact time of clotting to be conveniently determined. The various methods described in the literature for measuring the clotting of milk or blood (2) are either very complicated and time consuming or are not precise. The following method, used during a long series of investigations, was found to be quite accurate and very simple in operation. The method is {{based on the fact that}} when a concentrated dried milk powder solution, to which chymo-trypsin has been added, is allowed to flow slowly through a narrow tube the uniform flow of the milk is either brought to a sudden stop when the milk clots or, if the clot is soft, a definite mark of curd is left on the walls of the tube even after the dotted milk has continued to flow slowly through the tube. The volume of milk which escapes from the tube before clotting occurs can thus be determined. If, in addition, the rate of flow of the <b>milk</b> in the <b>tube</b> is known then the time required for the milk to clot can be readily calculated...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the working}} {{principles}} of falling film evaporator used in dairy industries {{in relation to}} the evaporation of skim milk have been explored with a focus on the effect of milk solids content. The changes in rheological behaviour of skim milk and heat transfer within the evaporator during the concentration process have been investigated. With the better understanding of the rheological behaviour of skim milk and the operation of a falling film evaporator, the possibility of improving the performance of commercial falling film evaporator from its current configuration can be assessed. The use of falling film evaporator is a common and economical practice in the food and beverage industries to remove water from liquid products, e. g. juices, milk, etc., especially when the product is temperature sensitive. In dairy industries, falling film evaporators are used to evaporate water from dairy products such as milk, protein concentrate, etc. Falling film evaporator is a well established technology but the understanding of rheological influence of milk on the performance and operation of falling film evaporator remains relatively unexplored which formed the motivation of this project. In milk powder production, milk is normally concentrated from around 10 wt% to 50 wt% or 52 wt% (this depends on the type of milk) using multi-effect falling film evaporator prior to the spray drying process. The viscosity changes of milk during the concentration process are evident, especially the exponential rise in viscosity as solids level reaches 50 wt%. With the increase in viscosity, the flowing characteristics of the <b>milks</b> within the <b>tubes</b> in the evaporator change with the concentration of milk. Consequently, the performance of the evaporator, in terms of heat transfer, is considerably affected. The current research project has been divided into 3 main parts into context of viscosity and evaporation of milk using falling film evaporator. Firstly, viscosity models of milk are established based on stringent viscosity measurement procedures that ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measurements. These models are used for process simulation, model based control and production planning. The second part is to evaluate the performance of falling film evaporator under the influences of various operation conditions. In the last part, findings from the first two sections are merged into a pilot evaporator mathematical model that is able to predict the solid content, flow characteristics and residence time of milk concentrate in a falling film evaporator. The viscosity of milk is influenced by several factors such as solids content, temperature, ageing and shearing, etc. The focus in this thesis is on the instantaneous milk viscosity during the operation of the falling film evaporator. Therefore, viscosity measurements and modelling of the milk viscosity have been mainly focused on only on the effect of solids content, temperature and, to some extend, shear rate. A 2 m steam-heated pilot evaporator was designed and constructed to commercial grade based on a falling film evaporator design. This pilot evaporator is able to operate under vacuum conditions (up to - 85 kPa gauge) in both shell and tube side so as to mimic the operation conditions in the dairy industries. The viscosity models in this thesis are predominately formulated based on the fresh and reconstituted medium heat-treated skim milk, unless otherwise stated. A comparison of viscosity models were made between the reconstituted and fresh skim milk. Significant differences were found and reported between the two types of milks. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC), a common method of quantifying the performance of an evaporator, was measured based on temperature difference between the heat transfer surface and the processed fluid (e. g. milk) and the energy transfer within the evaporator. Another 1 m electric-heated pilot evaporator was designed and built to facilitate the measurement at such temperatures and to have known power inputs which was not accessible in the steam-heated device. The influence of different operating conditions, such as varying heat flux, flow characteristics (e. g. Re number) and protein content, on the heat transfer coefficient is thoroughly investigated in this thesis. The study into the HTC on the product side found that the HTC measured from the evaporation of reconstituted skim milk is unresponsive to some of the operating conditions it was subjected to as compared to the fresh skim milk. Generally, HTC improves with greater Re number, heat flux and protein content (milk protein concentrate was added). Visual examination of the evaporation conditions within the evaporator also indicates that the amount of bubble formed during the evaporation process appears to increase with increasing flow rate, heat flux and protein content. During the formulation of the pilot evaporator model in this thesis, the viscosity models and heat transfer coefficients established in the current project were incorporated so as to model the steam-heated batch pilot evaporator. Several assumptions were introduced {{in order to create a}} working model. The pilot evaporator model has been verified against the actual experimental data and is proven to be accurate. This model is able to predict the solids content of the skim milk at any given time provided that the operating conditions are available. This model can also be applied onto a commercial falling film evaporator with minor modification to the calculation sequence. A scale-up version has been developed but due to commercial nature, it is not reported in this thesis. The research into the operation of falling film evaporator has been seen to enhance the knowledge of the mechanisms and interactions between the process fluid and the evaporator. Some of the results obtained here have already benefited an industrial operation...|$|R
