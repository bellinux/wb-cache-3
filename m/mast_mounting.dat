2500|$|At one point, the tugs succeeded {{turning the}} Star of Bengal on the {{starboard}} tack, but she immediately reverted {{to the port}} tack when either due to a sudden change in direction of the wind or due to an error on part of the Star of Bengals crew, her sails were filled aback. This resulted in a more dangerous situation, pushing all three vessels towards the rocky shore of Coronation island. The two tugs continued to struggle to pull the Star of Bengal out of danger, but the ships continued to drift leeward. Both tugs started to experience mechanical problems with their boilers due to overloading, and the Hattie Gage also developed structural problems with her <b>mast</b> <b>mounting.</b> At 3:50a.m. the Star of Bengal dropped her anchors in [...] of water. Pulled into less than [...] of water and occasionally as close as [...] to the land, the tugs finally severed the hawsers at 4:00a.m., steamed out of danger, and found shelter from still strengthening wind [...] away, behind Warren Island.|$|E
40|$|DE 10012487 A UPAB: 20001223 NOVELTY - The mast {{is mounted}} in a sleeve (1) in the ground, the sleeve {{comprising}} a weather-resistant material and containing a straight channel (3) {{with at least}} two entrances (5, 9), the first entrance (5) being wide enough to allow the mast to be inserted. The channel is narrowed at one or more points so that the outside of the mast is in direct contact with or very close {{to the inside of the}} sleeve, positioning the mast radially relative to the sleeve. At least one seal (8) inside the sleeve ensures a liquid-tight seal between the mast and sleeve. The second channel entrance (9) is oriented at 0 - 90 deg. with respect to the channel length axis (4), and at least one seal is provided close to this second entrance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for (a) the use of the device for mounting round masts, and (b) a <b>mast</b> <b>mounting</b> methof using the device. USE - None given. ADVANTAGE - A mast can be mounted more quickly and corrosion or rotting of the base of the mast is better prevented...|$|E

The MMS by Ball Aerospace & Technologies has a gyro-stabilized platform containing a television system (TVS), a thermal imaging system (TIS), and a laser range finder/designator (LRF/D).

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation of a}} 21 percent scale powered model of a prototype advanced scout helicopter was conducted in the Langley 4 by 7 Meter Tunnel. The investigation was conducted to define the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP), {{to determine the effects}} of the rotor on the aerodynamic characteristics and to evaluate the effect of a <b>mast</b> <b>mounted</b> sight on the aircraft stability characteristics. Tests covered a range of thrust coefficients, advance ratios, angles of attack and angles of sideslip and were run for both rotor on and rotor off configurations. Results of the investigation showed that the prototype configuration was longitudinally unstable with angle of attack for all configurations tested. The instability was due to unfavorable interference effects between the horizontal tail and the wake shed from the engine pylon and rotor hub, which caused a loss of horizontal tail effectiveness. The addition of the <b>mast</b> <b>mounted</b> sight had little effect on the stability of the model, but it caused an alteration in the rotor lift distribution that resulted in substantial interference drag for the sight...|$|R
50|$|Given the {{computing}} {{technology of}} the time and the survey simulation nature of the game (covering multiple helicopters), Gunship 2000 {{was never going to be}} a totally realistic simulation. However, the cockpits were reasonable copies of the real helicopter cockpits, and certain features such as <b>Mast</b> <b>Mounted</b> Sights were present on the smaller scout helicopters. However, avionics and flight modelling was rather generic. Realistic tactics such as nap-of-the-earth flight and 'pop-up' attacks could be employed on account of the reasonably detailed terrain.|$|R

In the first case, the flexible mast was restrained by cables, permitting modeling of SCOLE as a rigid-body. Starting from an arbitrary state, SCOLE was maneuvered to a specified terminal state using rigid-body minimum-time control law. In the second case, the so called single step optimal control (SSOC) theory is applied to suppress vibrations of the flexible <b>mast</b> <b>mounted</b> as a cantilever beam.
