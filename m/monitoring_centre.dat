The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E

However, a typical dose of 30 grams of fresh mushrooms will correspond to maximum 4.38 mg phenethylamine. The authors mention that phenethylamine is rapidly inactivated through metabolic breakdown by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but {{are suggesting that}} there may be an interaction between phenylethylamine and psilocin (the metabolic breakdown product of psilocybin) through competitive inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes. The issue has been described by the United Nations/CCOHS joint project IPCS INCHEM in a monograph, and by the European <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Centre</b> for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).|$|E

The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society (JWCS), are that [...] "they're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute."

[...] According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most people who watch them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations.
