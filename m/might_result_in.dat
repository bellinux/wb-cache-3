5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E
30|$|Our results {{stress the}} need of 3 -D {{modelling}} in an environment with large lateral variations in conductivity. The amplifications observed at coasts are {{at least on the}} same level as the maximum amplitudes obtained in 1 -D models. As previously shown in Fig. 4, using a 1 -D model <b>might</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> an underestimation of the peak amplitudes of the geoelectric field during a geomagnetic storm by a factor 2 – 3 at coastal sites. Due to the high temporal variability of the geoelectric field, coastal enhancements vary significantly during a geomagnetic storm.|$|R
40|$|An {{abnormal}} unilateral blockage of {{the jugular}} foramen by a bone growth converting {{it into a}} slit was noted in a skull during osteology demonstration classes for medical undergraduates. The left jugular foramen was narrowed by a thick bony projection filling the jugular fossa. This kind of narrowing of the foramen <b>might</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> neurovascular symptoms as it transmits important cranial nerves and internal jugular vein. Injury of ninth, tenth and eleventh cranial nerves can occur due to narrowing of jugular foramen know as Vernet’s syndrome is discussed along with case...|$|R
40|$|To {{what extent}} can social {{structure}} result from evolutionary processes as popposed to being deliberately organised? To begin {{to answer this}} questions five different but releated social simulations are reviewed, and a map of which mechanisms <b>might</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> what structures under what conditions being started. These show that different structures can be brought about by evolutionary processes based on the abilities and propensities of the individuals. The article ends with some challenges—to construct a credible simulations of more sophisticated structures: social group selection and self-organised value chains...|$|R
5|$|At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle {{during the}} mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of {{carrying}} a broom {{with him to}} emulate a guitar gained {{the attention of the}} school's social worker. After {{more than a year of}} his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the loss of {{all or part of}} his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{the destruction of}} the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E

5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E

40|$|Unusual {{communications}} between {{the branches of}} brachial plexus is not uncommon phenomenon. But among these, aberrant interconnection between radial and ulnar nerve is seldom reported. We present a case of persistence of well established abnormal communication between radial and ulnar nerves and its distribution to medial head of the triceps brachii muscle. Due to this, the triceps brachii which is normally innervated by radial nerve received additional innervations from the twigs of ulnar nerve through this communication. Aberrant communicating nervous channels when persist are vulnerable to iatrogenic injuries during surgical procedures as well as <b>might</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> entrapment neuropathic syndromes...|$|R

5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Niš in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January– February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) is {{an important}} component of infections acquired from hospital. The most signifi-cant feature of vascular surgery different from other surgeries is frequent application of artificial grafts. Once SSI occurs after vascular operations with grafts, it <b>might</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> a serious disaster. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus are the most common pathogenic bacteria for SSI after vascular surgery. Although SSI in vascular surgery often lacks of typical clinical characters, some clinical symptoms, laboratory data and certain imaging procedures may help to diagnose. In most cases of SSI after vascular procedures, the artificial grafts must be removed and sensitive antibi-otics should be administered. However, for different cases, personalized management plan should be made depending on the severity and location of SSI...|$|R
