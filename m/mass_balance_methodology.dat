The {{ecosystems}} {{sensitivity to}} toxic heavy metals atmospheric depositions can be evaluated calculating the Critical Load, an essential indicator for better understanding {{the evolution of}} environmental deterioration phenomena. In this work, the Steady State <b>Mass</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>methodology</b> with a semi-dynamic approach {{has been used to}} evaluate the Critical Loads for Cadmium and Lead for terrestrial ecosystems in four EMEP grids lOxlO Km representative of Bologna province, In order to evaluate the areas where the Cd and Pb depositions exceed the Critical Loads, the results of a long term characterisation of wet and dry atmospheric depositions, carried out in Bologna suburbs, has been used. Results highlight that CL values strongly depend on the soi! characteristics. According to the degree of sensitivity associated to the CL estimated values, no excess of Cd and Pb has been found for the agricultural soils, while, almost everywhere, deciduous forest soils show exceedances. Grasslands show negligible exceedances for Cd but significant for Pb; Pb exceedances also occur in coniferous forest soils. 1...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A {{methodology}} for quantitatively assessing {{the environmental impacts}} of home composting is demonstrated. The problem of measuring air flow rates through home compost bins was tackled by making comparisons with simultaneously run, forced-aeration sealed compost reactors at known air flow rates. Analysis of headspace gases for VOCs, CH 4, NH 3 and N 2 O are reported with concentrations of NH 3 up to 15 ppm and no CH 4 or N 2 O above atmospheric concentrations under tested conditions despite headspace CO 2 concentrations as high as 15 %. Headspace CO 2 concentration and compost temperature profiles are reported for a range of composting scenarios and the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> <b>methodology</b> is demonstrated. The benefits of home produced composts as soil improvers are measured in terms of water extractable nutrients and potentially toxic elements, with findings confirming previous work indicating they are safe and beneficial. The future direction of research and ongoing modelling work is discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|In Mediterranean areas, {{groundwater}} {{contributions are}} fundamental to maintain stream flow, especially during dry periods. Since groundwater withdrawal may affect stream discharge, understanding the hydraulic connectivity between streams and aquifers {{is critical to}} preserve stream runoff. However, assessing stream-aquifer interactions is often complex, due to spatial and temporal heterogeneities {{and the effect of}} diverse human pressures on the river system. Potential methods used to estimate this interaction work at different scales. All of them, however, offer complementary results which, in some cases, are difficult to integrate in a conceptual model for the stream hydrological dynamics that becomes useful to assess future water resources management actions. In this study we compare different Darcy's law and <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> <b>methodologies</b> to analyze their effectiveness in determining these relationships: piezometers drilled in the stream bed were used to qualitatively describe the stream-aquifer relationship and potentiometric maps at small and large scales, respectively; the incremental flow methodology and end member mixing analysis quantified the magnitude and the proportion of surface water, waste water and groundwater contributions to the stream flow; and hydrochemical analysis using Piper diagrams, Cl-/Br- ratios, and δ 18 O and δ 2 D identified the main origin of stream water. Finally, principal component analysis satisfactorily describes the hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the stream and aquifer interface and it {{can be used as a}} valid approach to support estimations derived from the above mentioned procedures. Different seasonal behaviors, including the effect of bank storage in the stream runoff, could be only recognized by the comprehensive use of all these methods.

40|$|Glaciers {{are one of}} the {{terrestrial}} essential climate variables (ECVs) as they respond very sensitively to climate change. A key driver of their response is the glacier surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> that is typically derived from field measurements. It deserves to be quantified over long time scales to better understand the accumulation and ablation processes at the glacier surface and their relationships with inter-annual changes in meteorological conditions and long-term climate changes. Glaciers with in situ monitoring of surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> are scarce at the global scale, and satellite remote sensing provides a powerful tool {{to increase the number of}} monitored glaciers. In this study, we present a review of three optical remote sensing methods developed to quantify seasonal and annual glacier surface <b>mass</b> <b>balances.</b> These <b>methodologies</b> rely on the multitemporal monitoring of the end-of-summer snow line for the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) method, the annual cycle of glacier surface albedo for the albedo method and the mapping of the regional snow cover at the seasonal scale for the snow-map method. Together with a presentation of each method, an application is illustrated. The ELA method shows promising results to quantify annual surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> and to reconstruct multi-decadal time series. The other two methods currently need a calibration on the basis of existing in situ data; however, a generalization of these methods (without calibration) could be achieved. The two latter methods show satisfying results at the annual and seasonal scales, particularly for the summer surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> in the case of the albedo method and for the winter surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> in the case of the snow-map method. The limits of each method (e. g., cloud coverage, debris-covered glaciers, monsoon-regime and cold glaciers), their complementarities and the future challenges (e. g., automating of the satellite images processing, generalization of the methods needing calibration) are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{from animal}} feeding operations (AFOs) has caused concerns on {{public health and}} environmental degradation, such as ecosystem acidification, eutrophication, and formation of PM 2. 5 fine particles. Current ammonia emission measurement methodologies are accurate and reliable, but time consuming, expensive, and impractical for most facilities. In the present study, an alternative and cost effective <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> <b>methodology</b> was developed to predict the ammonia emission from animal facilities. The mass balance equations {{have been developed to}} eliminate needs for tracking manure flow rate to obtain accurate NH 3 estimation. The methodology was applied to three manure-belt layer poultry houses with approximately 150, 000 birds in each house in Ohio and validated using continuous ammonia emission measurement data. Feed, manure and egg samples were collected from the three houses in three seasons (cold, mild, and hot) to evaluate the seasonal variation of ammonia emission from the poultry facilities. Results show that this alternative mass balance method can estimate NH 3 emission from manure-belt poultry layer house effectively. NH 3 emission rate from manure belt poultry layer houses with manure removal every 3. 5 to 5 days was 0. 07 - 0. 37 g NH 3 bird- 1 day- 1. These results agrees well with the NH 3 emission values published in the previous literatures (0. 027 - 0. 616 g NH 3 bird- 1 day- 1), but were lower than the NH 3 emission rate (0. 1 - 0. 86 g NH 3 bird- 1 day- 1) measured using continuous monitoring system. In the comparison analysis of NH 3 measurement and estimation emissions, Normalized Mean Error (NME), Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and Fractional Bias (FB) are calculated to be 52. 05 %, 85. 32 % and - 70. 36 % respectively. This study suggests that manure removal time interval and air temperature can be important factors impacting NH 3 emission. This mass balance method can only estimate total nitrogen loss in a whole production process, which is an upper bound of NH 3 -N loss. It is needed to quantify other nitrogen compound gas emissions, such as N 2 O, NOx, N 2 for accurate NH 3 emission estimation...|$|E
40|$|In this article, two {{theories}} are unified {{to investigate the}} effect of hydrodynamics on a specific bioprocess: the network-of-zones (NOZ) hydrodynamic structured modeling approach (developed by several researchers but applied to only a few bioprocesses) and the effectiveness factor eta approach. Two process scales were investigated (20 and 500 L), and for each, hydrodynamics were quantified using an NOZ validated by homogeneity time measurements. Several impeller combinations inducing quite different hydrodynamics were tested at the 20 -L scale. After this step, effectiveness factors were determined for each fermentation run. To achieve this, a perfectly mixed microbial kinetic model was evaluated by using simple Monod kinetics with a fed-batch <b>mass</b> <b>balance.</b> This <b>methodology</b> permitted determination of the effectiveness factor with more accuracy because of the relation with the perfect case deduced from the Monod kinetics. It appeared that for the small scale, eta decreased until reaching a value of approx 0. 7 (30 % from the ideal case) for the three impeller systems investigated. However, stirring systems that include hydrofoils seemed to maintain higher effectiveness factors {{during the course of}} the fermentation. This effect can be attributed to oxygen transfer performance or to homogenization efficiency exhibited by the hydrofoils. To distinguish the oxygen transfer from the homogenization component of the effectiveness factor, these phenomena were analyzed separately. After determining the evolution of etaO 2 linked to oxygen transfer for each of the fermentation runs, the NOZ model was employed to quantify substrate gradient appearance. After this step, another effectiveness factor, etamix, related to mixing was defined. Consequently, it is possible to distinguish the relative importance of the mixing effect and oxygen transfer on a given bioprocess. The results have highlighted an important scale effect on the bioprocess that can be analyzed using the NOZ model. Peer reviewe...|$|R

We use the 1946 – 2004 long term record, transient <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> measurements in 2004, and results from a distributed energy-balance mass-balance model. The long term and transient relationships are in good agreement for negative and slightly positive <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> corresponding to AAR of roughly 0. 2 to 0. 6, but progressively deviate from each other with increasing net balances and larger AARs.

Glacier specific Seasonal Sensitivity Characteristics based on a <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> model of intermediate complexity are used to simulate <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> of Nigardsbreen (Norway) and Rhonegletscher (Switzerland). Simulations using reanalyses (ECMWF) for the period 1979 - 1993 are in good agreement with in situ <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> measurements for Nigardsbreen.

A high correlation between decadal variations {{in the north atlantic}} oscillation (NAO) and <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of the glaciers is found. The dominant factor for this relationship is the strong impact of winter precipitation associated with the NAO. A high NAO phase means enhanced (reduced) winter precipitation for Nigardsbreen (Rhonegletscher), typically leading to a higher (lower) than normal annual <b>mass</b> <b>balance.</b> This mechanism, entirely due to internal variations in the climate system, can explain observed strong positive <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> for Nigardsbreen and possibly other maritime Norwegian glaciers within the period 1980 - 1995.

The reconstructions show intervals of positive <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> between AD 1865 to 1883 and AD 1956 to 1980, and intervals of negative <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> between AD 1885 to 1895, 1930 to 1950, and the mid 1980 s to 2010. The generalized periods of positive and negative <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> correspond well with known periods of advance and retreat for Easton Glacier, as well as independent proxy records developed for the Pacific Northwest. Our results highlight the influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and provide the framework for studies of long-term climate and glacier variability in our study area.

Several indirect methods were also used for estimating its <b>mass</b> <b>balance.</b> These methods {{were divided into two}} major groups: climatological and geo− detic. A comparison of the latest map (2000) with that of 1978 and climatological records enable us to calculate the change in the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of Waldemarbreen over 34 years. These methods include air temperature and degree−day (PDD) models. The average <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of Waldemarbreen, computed by climatological methods, was − 0. 42 m a− 1 of water equivalent (w. e.) for the period 1970 – 2004, and − 0. 51 m w. e. for 1996 – 2004. These bal− ances were compared with the glaciological balance for the period 1996 – 2004, − 0. 53 m w. e [...] The <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> was also computed using geodetic method, giving − 0. 52 m of w. e. from 1978 to 2000. It is suggested that, from these results, the approach used for Waldemar− breen might be also useful for estimation the <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> of other small Svalbard glaciers which terminate on land.

40|$|Due {{to their}} remote {{location}} within the Russian High Arctic, {{little is known}} about the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of ice caps on Severnaya Zemlya now and in the past. Such information is critical, however, to building a global picture of the cryospheric response to climate change. This paper provides a numerical analysis of the climate and <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island. <b>Mass</b> <b>balance</b> model results are compared with available glaciological and climatological data. A reference climate was constructed at the location of Vavilov Station, representing average conditions for the periods 1974 – 1981 and 1985 – 1988. The site of the station has a mean annual temperature of - 16. 5 ºC, and an annual precipitation of 423 mm water equivalent. The <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> model was calibrated to the measured <b>mass</b> <b>balance,</b> and tested against the time-dependent evolution of the englacial temperatures (to a depth of 15 m). The <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> model was then converted to a distributed model for the entire Vavilov Ice Cap. Model results predict the spatial distribution of <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> components over the ice cap. Processes involving refreezing of water are found to be critical to the ice cap’s state of health. Superimposed ice makes up 40...|$|R
