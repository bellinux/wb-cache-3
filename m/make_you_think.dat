500|$|Author Matthew Chojnacki {{recommended}} {{the film in}} his book Alternative Movie Posters: Film Art From the Underground. Jim Craddock, in his book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, gave the film two-and-a-half out of four bones, calling the film a [...] "Visually striking, campy but slick horror flick that'll <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> twice about your next visit to the big top". Director Brian Herzlinger considers Killer Klowns from Outer Space to be [...] "his favorite cult film".|$|E
500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials. I guess this song is supposed to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>THINK</b> about stuff [...] but mostly it makes me try to find someone to blame for this".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Marisa G. Muller {{noted that}} Gaga {{spoke of the}} artists and the {{personnel}} involved with the event continuously throughout the night, and [...] " [...] being {{more than an hour}} late, Gaga made her tight-knit audience of little monsters feel special... Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak." [...] David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a [...] "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions that <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the nature of philosophy and life and art." [...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|The game is {{markedly}} {{more difficult}} than its predecessor. Amiga Format called this [...] "good/bad news", whereas The One directed its [...] "major criticism" [...] at the difficulty level, saying [...] "some of the levels are quite simply horrendous", and that the game is [...] "close to being intensely frustrating at times." [...] Amiga Computing also felt the high difficulty to be the [...] "biggest problem": [...] "I like a game to get progressively harder rather than getting virtually impossible after just four missions." [...] Amiga Format also criticised the difficulty and felt [...] "some of the levels are {{a bit of a}} drag." [...] Amiga Power was annoyed at the early tutorial missions, finding them redundant, but otherwise noted the increased challenge as a positive, and said: [...] "The original game went in pulses of fiendishly hard and stupidly simple levels, but in CF2 the difficulty curve's, well, more of a curve." [...] The reviewer praised the clever level design, explaining: [...] "The levels penalise you for taking the obvious route and reward you for trying an obscure approach [...] loads of levels <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> before you move, injecting puzzle elements into the killing", citing the example of traps with empty vehicles as bait. The reviewer praised the smaller, tighter levels with a difficulty curve within those levels: [...] "gung-ho" [...] sections building to tactical play against tougher enemies. He compared this favourably with the first game: [...] "The level design is consistently better", in particular the [...] "Beirut, Mediaevil and Chicago levels look and play wonderfully." [...] He nevertheless felt the thematic shifts lacked coherence and atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Car and Driver {{declared}} [...] "Even {{the most}} jaded car critics {{are in fact}} tripping over each other {{trying to be the}} first to anoint this sedan to be the best full-sized Chevrolet ever made." [...] Car and Driver commented on the F41 suspension option which included stiffer springs, larger sway bars, wheels, and tires to say, [...] "It will <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> your Chevy came from the Black Forest instead of Detroit." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the track, Harrison edited in {{the faint}} sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the tar shehnai. This part was taken from [...] "Crying", an {{instrumental}} piece performed by Vinayak Vora and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album Wonderwall Music. When asked about its inclusion in [...] "Save the World", Harrison told Musician magazine in 1987: [...] "I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Ohhh shit.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that maybe he should stay at this game".|$|E
2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that horrible things pounce on people, and they <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you want to see this movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film an [...] "old-fashioned monster movie {{dressed up in}} trendy new threads", praising the special effects, [...] "nihilistic attitude" [...] and [...] "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, [...] "In the end, [...] not much {{different}} from all the marauding creature features that have come before it". Scott Foundas of LA Weekly was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the September 11 attacks in New York City and called it [...] "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in [...] "stealth" [...] attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of Don Siegel, George A. Romero and Steven Spielberg, saying, [...] "Where those filmmakers all had something meaningful to say {{about the state of the}} world and [...] human nature, Abrams doesn't have much to say about anything". Manohla Dargis in the New York Times called the allusions [...] "tacky", saying, [...] " [...] may <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination", but that [...] "the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence". She concludes that the film [...] "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com calls the film [...] "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film [...] "takes the trauma of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune warned that the viewer may feel [...] "queasy" [...] at the references to September 11, but that [...] "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" [...] and that such tactics were [...] "crude, but undeniably gripping". He called the film [...] "dumb", but [...] "quick and dirty and effectively brusque", concluding that despite it being [...] "a harsher, more demographically calculating brand of fun", he enjoyed the film. Bruce Paterson of Cinephilia described the film as [...] "a successful experiment in style but not necessarily a successful story for those who want dramatic closure". [...] Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the Half-Life video game series, in particular the [...] "Ant-lion" [...] monsters from Half-Life 2, and the constant first-person perspective.|$|E
