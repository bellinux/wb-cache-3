Garlic does well in loose, dry, well-drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout USDA climate zones 4–9.

500|$|To many scholars, [...] is a {{landmark}} Latin American novel because of Asturias's early use of magic realism, a literary technique often employed by acclaimed Latin American {{writers such as}} Gabriel García Márquez. In an interview with Asturias, Gunter Lorenz heralded Asturias as the inventor of magic realism, and even as its most successful practitioner. Asturias himself defines this style not as [...] "a concrete reality but a reality that arises from a definitely magical imagination... in which we see the real disappear and the dream emerge, in which dreams are transformed into a tangible reality". Richard Franklin argues that magic realism is most evident in Asturias's exploration and depiction of the innermost reality of the human mind. This exploration is combined with [...] "the <b>material</b> <b>content</b> of an urban mass caught {{in the grip of}} an iron regime" [...] throughout the novel. Franklin goes on to herald the synthesis of these two elements as [...] "a real contribution to the novelistic genre of America".|$|E
