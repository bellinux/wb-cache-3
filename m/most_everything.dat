25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards <b>most</b> <b>everything</b> they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
25|$|For {{the seven}} years during which Lowe owned and {{operated}} the railway, it constantly ran into hard times, eventually being sold off. A series of natural disasters ate away at the facilities, {{the first of which}} was a kitchen fire that destroyed the Echo Mountain House in 1900. Further fires and floods eventually destroyed any remaining facilities, and the railway was officially abandoned in 1938 after a flood washed <b>most</b> <b>everything</b> off the mountain sides. Today, the ruins of Mount Lowe Railway remain as a monument to a once-ever experienced enterprise. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Places on January 6, 1993, a listing that was enlarged in January 2015.|$|E

He praised the chorus and the middle section and called the track [...] "classic Britney". The song was also compared to Madonna's [...] "Celebration", since they [...] "musically present nothing particularly new, but they do manage to encapsulate many of the elements that make the singer a star". A.J. Mayers of MTV picked it as the eighth best song of 2009.|$|E

500|$|On 19 September, Groves went to Donald Nelson, the {{chairman}} of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President. Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944. According to Groves, [...] "In Washington you became {{aware of the importance of}} top priority. <b>Most</b> <b>everything</b> proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority".|$|E

Willamette Week of Portland labeled Rivers [...] "The CRC killer" [...] for her leadership role in the opposition to the proposed megaproject. Due to their opposition to the project, in July 2013, Governor Jay Inslee labeled both Rivers and Senator Don Benton from the neighboring 17th district [...] "a brick wall to economic progress and CRC." [...] Speaking to a group of CRC supports, [...] "The road to this bridge runs through two senators from this region.

The band aimed for a [...] "euphoric" [...] sound to provide a [...] "contradiction between the way the lyrics are and [...] sound". In March 2015, they described their sound as [...] "Baroque Obama" [...] on Facebook, explaining to Gigwise that [...] "it's where Bach meets Jay Z". For certain tracks, Robertshaw said their aim was [...] "to sound like changing radio stations", toying with various musical ideas in one song in the same style as Kendrick Lamar. Spearman compared this style to the humour in The Simpsons: [...] "It's twenty minutes of 'bang, bang, bang' – where it started up was way different to where it ends up.

500|$|As with Zippo Games' {{previous}} projects, {{the concept}} art was drawn on paper. The graphics were then drawn with Deluxe Paint and then translated into the ROM manually, sprite-by-sprite, as the NES hardware required precision in sprite placements; {{this was different}} from what Rare did, which was to place each pixel of the graphics sprites on graph paper with marker pens and then tasked people to type the code into the ROM. Ste Pickford said that while Rare's sprite-drawing method was easier, his method, while time-consuming, was more efficient. <b>Most</b> <b>everything</b> from the previous Wizards & Warriors games were removed, except for the main protagonist, Kuros, and the game's main antagonist, Malkil. The concept art was originally drawn in black and white, even though the games were being designed in color, to save money from photocopying or printing in color - {{both of which were}} very expensive at the time. In developing the [...] "Demon" [...] mini-boss, Pickford could only use about three animation frames, as the sprite was large for the NES hardware. Pickford designed the [...] "Worm" [...] boss similar to the bosses found in R-Type, where a series of smaller sprites formed a snake or worm-like enemy; however, he commented that [...] "it ended up in the game more like a giant floating head". Pickford drew inspiration from the thrones in Super Mario Bros. 3 in designing the final boss, Malkil.|$|E

2500|$|Thereafter, the Franciscans all but {{abandoned}} the Mission, taking with them <b>most</b> <b>everything</b> of value, {{after which the}} locals plundered many of the Mission buildings for construction materials. According to Bancroft, [...] "The population of San Juan Capistrano in 1834 had decreased to 861 souls, and in 1840 it was probably less than 500 with less than 100 at the pueblo proper; while in its crops San Juan (Capistrano) showed a larger deterioration than any other (missionary) establishment." [...] By 1835, little of the Mission's assets remained, though the manufacture of hides and tallow continued in full swing as described in Richard Henry Dana's classic novel Two Years Before the Mast. The Mission was declared to be [...] "in a ruinous state" [...] and the Indian pueblo dissolved in 1841. San Juan Capistrano was officially designated by Governor Juan B. Alvarado as a secular Mexican town on July 29, at which time those few who still resided at the Mission were granted sections of land to use as their own. Following this change in status, {{the area around the}} Mission began to decay rapidly; Santiago Argüello (then prefect of the southern District of Los Angeles) complained to the Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, Don José de la Guerra y Noriega, that [...] "...the unfortunate missions of San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano [...] been converted into brothels of the mayordomos.|$|E
