40|$|Previous {{research}} is unclear about who supports {{the use of}} referendums and why. One line of research suggests that people with greater cognitive resources are more supportive of referendums. Another line claims that referendums are supported by citizens who feel disconnected from the political process. We integrate both perspectives, include civic duty and political cynicism as key explanatory variables, and offer a model explaining referendum support across Europe drawing on both individual and contextual factors. Our study {{is based on a}} survey conducted in 21 EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>N</b> = 22, 806). Results show support for both perspectives and for our new indicators, suggesting that referendum support is highest among citizens who are critical of traditional party politics but committed to democratic practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of a democratic deficit in the European Union (EU) is widespread. In which circumstances is this perception affected by mass media and interpersonal communication? To answer this question, we analyze data from representative samples of citizens in 21 EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>N</b> = 22, 806) and linked to news items (N = 36, 881) these citizens were exposed to in the 2009 European election campaign. Our results indicate that theoretically expected interpersonal communication effects exist in all countries. We find media effects in countries with a one-sided message flow that is positive about EU democratic performance. In these countries, the media {{have a positive effect}} on EU democratic performance perceptions, and the effect is larger among less sophisticated citizens. Negative interpersonal communication effects are stronger among sophisticated citizens. Furthermore, among less sophisticated citizens, we find a positive reinforcement effect of mass media and interpersonal communication. These findings suggest that the EU has more possibilities to positively affect public opinion than has been assumed...|$|R

40|$|What {{determines the}} {{allocation}} of voting weights to <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in international organizations? What drives the seat and voting weight allocation in the European Parliament (EP) and in the Council of the European Union (EU) ? Our objective {{in this article is}} to develop a universal logical model and to demonstrate that the resulting equation indeed captures negotiated outcomes on seat and voting weight allocations in EU institutions from their beginning. We predict seat and voting weight allocations for both the EP and the Council of the EU within one general model. Hence, we do not employ actual data on seat allocations or voting weights in either the EP or the Council of the EU, but instead, use logical constraints exclusively, as posed by the following elements: the total number of seats/voting weights (S), the number of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>N)</b> and, finally, their respective population size (P i). Only our final model selection among several theoretical options is guided by empirical information. With no post hoc parameters used, our model fits both the Council of the EU and the EP rather well, over a time span of nearly 40 years. Inspired by the 'seat-vote equation' (Taagepera, 1973) for seat allocation in national legislatures, the new 'seat-population equation' calculates the number (S i) of EP seats or Council voting weights of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> i as follows: S i = SP i n /∑P i n, where n = (1 /logN - 1 /log S) /(1 /logN - 1 /log P), P being the total population (as summed over all <b>member</b> <b>states).</b> We posit that this equation is applicable to predict outcomes in practice whenever voting weight or seat allocations in international organizations are allocated {{on the basis of the}} population shares of their component entities. © 2006 political studies association...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{greenhouse}} gas emissions account for 10 and 7 % of total anthropogenic GHG emissions without considering emissions and removals from land use change and forestry for EU- 15 countries and New <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> respectively, with a general trend towards a decreasing significance of agriculture for the overall national GHG inventories. Differences between EU- 15 countries and the New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are found less {{in the structure of}} the national GHG inventories with respect to agriculture but rather in the trend of emissions and, if related, to economic indicators. So are per capita GHG emissions from agriculture significantly lower for New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and Candidate Countries (0. 64 ± 0. 25 t CO 2 -eq/inhabitant) than for the EU- 15 countries (1. 34 ± 1. 02 t CO 2 -eq/inhabitant), whereby the large standard deviation for EU- 15 originatesfrom the “outlying” Ireland with 4. 8 t CO 2 - eq/inhabitant. The development of agricultural GHG emissions saw slight increases to significant decreases of emissions for EU- 15 countries, which, however, followed a more or less linear path. For the New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and Candidate Countries emissions from the agricultural sector, as for the total GHG inventory, decreases were substantial in the early years of the 1990 s. Emissions from agriculture stabilized at a low level or increased again in the late 1990 s. Even though the variability of the sub-sectoral composition of emissions from agriculture across the countries is high, there is no general principal difference between EU- 15 countries and New <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Differences in the agricultural systems, however, can be seen by looking at the dominant {{greenhouse gas}} emitted from manure management systems; in the New <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> more <b>N</b> 2 O is being emitted from this category, while in EU- 15 and Candidate Countries CH 4 intensive systems are being used.

40|$|Manure {{management}} systems are conducive to nutrient and carbon losses, but {{the magnitude of}} the loss highly depends on the nutrient element, the manure management system and the environmental conditions. This paper discusses manure {{management systems}} in the 27 <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the European Union (EU- 27) and nutrient losses from these systems, with emphasis on nitrogen (N). In general, losses decrease in the order: C, N >> S > K, Na, Cl, B > P, Ca, Mg, metals. Assessments made with the integrated modeling tool MITERRA-EUROPE indicate that the total N excretion in 2000 by livestock in EU- 27 was 10, 400 kton. About 65 % of the total N excretion was collected in barns and stored for some time prior to application to agricultural land. Almost 30 % of the N excreted in barns was lost during storage; approximately 19 % via NH 3 emissions, 7 % via emissions of NO, N 2 O and N 2, and 4 % via leaching and run-off. Differences between <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in mean <b>N</b> losses from manure storages were large (range 19. 5 ¿ 35 %). Another 19 % of the N excreted in animal housing systems was lost via NH 3 emissions following the application of the manure to land. The results indicate that maximally 52 % of the N excreted in barns was effectively recycled as plant nutrient. Various emission abatement measures can be implemented and have been implemented already in some <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to reduce the emissions of NH 3 and N 2 O, and the leaching of N and P. There is scope to reduce NH 3 emissions by 30 % relative to the reference year 2000, although the uncertainty in estimated emissions and in the estimated effects of emission abatement measures is relatively large...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest.
