In Casablanca, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film La La Land contains multiple allusions to Casablanca in the imagery, dialogue, and plot.|$|E

40|$|The {{access of}} data {{is a major}} problem in array and vector processors. As a {{solution}} is to use numerous independent <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> in parallel, one question arise : how can we store a matrix of size N Θ N in the different <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> to allow conflict-free access on commonly used vectors (rows, columns, diagonals, etc [...] .). Many solutions have yet been discussed. For example, one can skew the data in the different <b>memory</b> <b>banks.</b> The skewing scheme we introduce uses the advantages of Budnik and Kuck principles and also of Lawrie, without the drawbacks. In fact, the idea is based to a part of the study of the one proposed by Lawrie. It allows, for a system including N <b>memory</b> <b>banks,</b> conflict-free access on various slices of data. It is characterized by both efficient use of the number of <b>memory</b> <b>banks,</b> and simplicity of implementation. Finally, we suggest an alignment network to be used with this storage scheme.

That year he also starred in the public {{television}} film Overdrawn at the <b>Memory</b> <b>Bank,</b> which received a weak reception and was satirized on Mystery Science Theater 3000. After not appearing in a film for two years, Juliá played a political prisoner named Valentín in an adaptation of Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman. Considering that the script was unique, he agreed to begin filming before receiving his salary and traveled to South America, where he interviewed rebels and ex-prisoners to familiarize himself with their experiences and ideology. Upon its release, the film was a commercial success. For his performance, Juliá received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award and won the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures' award for best actor along with co-lead actor William Hurt.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2014, NASA {{reported}} that Opportunity {{was suffering from}} [...] "amnesia" [...] events in which the rover fails to write data, e.g. telemetry information, to non-volatile memory.

He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar.

40|$|Multiple <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> {{design is}} {{employed}} in many high performance DSP processors. This architectural feature supports higher memory bandwidth by allowing multiple data memory access {{to be executed}} in parallel. Dedicated address generation units (AGUs) are commonly presented in DSPs to perform address arithmetic in parallel to the main datapath. Address assignment, optimization of memory layout of program variables to reduce address arithmetic instruction, has been studied extensively on single memory architecture. Make effective use of AGUs on multiple <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> is a great challenge to compiler design {{and has not been}} studied previously. In this paper, we exploit address assignment with variable partitioning for scheduling on DSP architectures with multiple <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> and AGUs. Our approach is built on novel graph models which capture both parallelism and serialism demands. An efficient scheduling algorithm, Address Assignment Sensitive Variable Partitioning (AASVP), is proposed to best leverage both multiple <b>memory</b> <b>banks</b> and AGUs.
