In the following year he accepted a request from the Anthony Powell Society to serve as its president, a post he held until 2011.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, the Moose {{franchise}} was {{relocated to}} St. John's, Newfoundland {{due to the}} Winnipeg Jets' return to the NHL, forcing the team out of the Winnipeg <b>market.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the Canucks began a new AHL affiliation, moving Schroeder to the Chicago Wolves for the 2011–12 season. He scored his first goal with the Wolves on October 14, 2011, in a 4–2 loss to the Milwaukee Admirals. He finished the 2011-12 season third on the Wolves with 21 goals and 44 points.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe {{is exactly the same}} as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.|$|E

5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the year}} 2072, the protagonist—a nameless hacker—is caught while {{attempting}} to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. The hacker is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker {{in exchange for a}} confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the station. Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to sell it on the black <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> biological weapon. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the hacker a valuable military grade neural implant. After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface. Following the operation, the hacker is put into a six-month healing coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated, transformed into cyborgs, or killed.|$|E
5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on the open <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, and Suddenly, Last Summer. Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E

25|$|Markets {{of varying}} types can spontaneously arise {{whenever}} a party has {{interest in a}} good or service that some other party can provide. Hence {{there can be a}} market for cigarettes in correctional facilities, another for chewing gum in a playground, and yet another for contracts for the future delivery of a commodity. There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A market can be organized as an auction, as a private electronic <b>market,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commodity wholesale <b>market,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an informal discussion between two individuals.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{activities}} in the market have strongly been criticized by {{a good number of}} people across the country, who have painfully experiences the loss of money and prized gadgets to the schemes of unqualified engineers and fraudsters, who use the chaotic <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> medium to rip off people or sell counterfeit products and services, such as mobile phones, software, accessories, etc.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson.

Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> casino.|$|E

25|$|Salaries play {{a crucial}} role in the {{tangible}} reward system. They are an important factor in attracting new talent to an organization as well as retaining talent. Compensating employees well is one way for an organization to reinforce an employee's value to the organization.

25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate its success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the <b>market</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E
