40|$|We {{present a}} thermoelastically driven MOEMS light {{modulator}} {{in the form}} of an ElectroThermal Grating (ETG). The ETG consists of an array of equally spaced bilayer <b>microbeams</b> suspended at both ends above a substrate (Fig. 1). The bilayer <b>microbeams</b> have a conductive/reflective top layer that has highly resistive end sections, and a central portion with low resistance, and a nonconductive bottom layer. In an unactivated state, the <b>microbeams</b> are flat and the ETG reflects incident light like a mirror (Fig. 2 a). Light modulation occurs when a potential difference is applied across the conductive layers of alternate <b>microbeams.</b> This causes current to flow through the resistive end sections which, in turn, expand due to joule heating. The top sections expand more than the corresponding bottom sections, which have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion. This causes a thermoelastically induced deformation of the heated <b>microbeams</b> downward, toward the substrate. A diffraction pattern is produced when the heated <b>microbeams</b> deform a distance of / 4 O from their rest position (O is the wavelength of the incident light) (Fig. 2 b). Since the deformation depends on the level of current, an ETG can operate in an analog mode wherein it selectively diffracts a range of wavelengths. In this presentation, we demonstrate the performance of an ETG. We present an analytical design formula for rapid parametric optimization, and demonstrate ETG viability at operating voltages below one volt...|$|R

In this study, nonlinear finite element method (FEM) modeling and the experimental validation of residual stress induced in the clamped-clamped <b>microbeams</b> and the symmetric toggle RF-MEMS switch (STS) is presented. The formation of residual stress due to plastic deformation during the thermal loading-unloading cycle in the plasma etching step of the microfabrication process is explained and modeled using the Bauschinger effect.

The simulated residual stress due to the plastic deformation is included in the STS models to obtain the switch pull-in voltage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and a finite-element {{analysis of the}} effect of squeeze film damping on the resonance frequency and quality factor of the higher-order flexure vibrations modes of clamped-clamped <b>microbeams.</b> Viscoelastic and silicon nitride <b>microbeams</b> are fabricated and are electrostatically actuated by various electrode configurations to trigger the first, second, and third modes. The damping characteristic and the resonance frequency of these modes are examined {{for a wide range of}} gas pressure and electrostatic voltage loads. The results of the silicon nitride beams and viscoelastic beams are compared. It is found that the intrinsic material loss is the major dissipation mechanism at low pressure for the viscoelastic <b>microbeams,</b> significantly limiting their quality factor. It is also found that while the silicon nitride beams show higher quality factors at the intrinsic and molecular regimes of pressure, due to their low intrinsic loss, their quality factors near atmospheric pressure are lower than those of the viscoelastic <b>microbeams.</b> Further, the higher-order modes of all the beams show much higher quality factors at atmospheric pressure compared to the first mode, which could be promising for operating such resonators in air. Experimental results and finite element model simulations show good agreement for resonance frequency and quality factor for the three studied modes. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMicrobeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) uses {{spatially}} a fractionated "white beam" (energies 50 - 350 keV) irradiation from a Synchrotron Source. The typical <b>microbeams</b> used at ID 17 are 25 - 100 mu m-thick, spaced by 200 - 400 mu m, {{and carry}} extremely high dose rates (up to about 16 kGy/s). These <b>microbeams</b> are well tolerated by biological tissue, i. e. {{up to several}} hundred of Gy in the peaks. When valley doses, caused by Compton scattering in between two <b>microbeams,</b> remain within a dose regime similar to conventional RT, a superior tumour control can be achieved with MRT than with conventional RT. The normal tissue tolerance of these microscopically small beams is outstanding and well documented in the literature. The hypothesis of a differential effect in particular on the vasculature of normal versus tumoral tissue might best be proven by using large animal models with spontaneous tumors instead of small laboratory animals with transplantable tumors, an ongoing project on ID 17.

Ultraviolet light, including low-energy UVA (320 - 400 nm) radiation, as well as high-intensity near infrared (NIR) laser radiation may induce cell damage. A total number of 580 light-exposed sperm cells were studied in single-cell photostress experiments. Low-power (1. 5 mW, 5. 3 W/cm 2) UVA exposure with 365 nm radiation of a standard mercury microscopy lamp to human spermatozoa resulted within 109 ± 30 s in paralysis and within 310 ± 110 s in cell death. Cytotoxic effects during cell manipulation with laser <b>microbeams</b> {{were found to be}} partly based on non-linear excitation phenomena, in particular two-photon absorption by endogenous cell chromophores. Two-photon absorption will be more intense in the case of pulsed laser microradiation, but occur also during micromanipulation with highly focused continuous wave (cw) <b>microbeams</b> used as laser tweezers ('optical traps'). In particular, short-wavelength NIR traps < 800 nm induce UVA-like biological effects (oxidative stress). For example, sperm trapping with 760 nm <b>microbeams</b> resulted in UVA-like autofluorescence modifications, paralysis within 35 ± 20 s and cell death within 65 ± 20 s. In contrast, laser <b>microbeams</b> at 800 - 1064 nm may act as relatively safe micromanipulation tools. In most optical traps multifrequency cw lasers are employed. Radiation of these lasers can magnify cytotoxic effects. Therefore, single-frequency laser operation should be preferred.

40|$|Micro-sensors or micro-switches usually {{operate under}} the effect of {{electrostatic}} force and could face some environmental effects like humidity, which may lead to condensation underneath the beams and create strong capillary forces. Those tiny structures are principally made of <b>microbeams</b> that can undergo instabilities under the effect of those created huge capillary forces. In fact, during the fabrication of <b>microbeams,</b> {{there is an important}} step to separate the beam from its substrate (wet etching). After this step, the microstructure is dried, which may causes the onset of some droplets of water trapped underneath the beam that could bring about a huge capillary force pulling it toward its substrate. If this force is bigger than the <b>microbeam's</b> restoring force, it will become stuck to the substrate. This paper investigates the instability scenarios of both clamped-clamped (straight and curved) and cantilever (straight and curled) <b>microbeams</b> under the effect of capillary and/or electrostatic forces. The reduced order modeling (ROM) based on the Galerkin procedure is used to solve the nonlinear beam equations. The non-ideal boundaries are modeled by adding springs. The volume of the fluid between the beam and the substrate underneath it is varied and the relation between the volume of the water and the stability of the beam is shown. An analysis for the factors of which should be taken in to consideration in the fabrication processes to overcome the instability due to huge capillary forces is done. Also the size of the electrode for the electrostatic force is varied to show the effect on the micro-switch stability. A variation of the pull-in voltage with some specific beam parameters and with more than one case of electrode size is shown. It is found that capillary forces have a pronounced effect on the stability of <b>microbeams.</b> It is also found that the pull-in length decreases as the electrode size increases.
