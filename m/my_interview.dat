She said her initial reaction was surprise and [...] "a certain air of disbelief" [...] because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked about any of the allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not prepared for what the story looked like. Nor do I think her characterization of <b>my</b> <b>interview</b> was fair." ...|$|E

"I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following <b>my</b> <b>interview</b> with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following <b>my</b> <b>interview</b> with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.)

40|$|Speaking of Art {{contains}} {{eleven of}} <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> with artists (comprising {{just over a}} quarter of the book). It is the first time these extensive research-based interviews been made public in written form, and they have all been re-edited and re-contextualised for the medium of print. The research nature of the work is two-fold. In each case I have conducted specific research, both primary and secondary, into the individual artist and his or her work, so as to inform the conversation – as evidenced by the <b>interview</b> content. However, <b>my</b> work also testifies to a developing research methodology that employs the conversational interview to produce new primary material, foregrounding the artist’s voice. This dimension of my process has made a significant contribution to the expanding focus on ‘the voice’ in art practice and discourse. The interviews published in Speaking of Art represent a small sample of my ongoing projects: I have conducted over 900 interviews in total, for a variety of contexts. From 1996 – 2009 I was principal interviewer for Audio Arts, one of the world’s largest and most wide-ranging sound archives devoted to art and artists. The entire, unedited archive of my recordings was acquired by Tate between 2004 – 2009. Tate’s 2012 conference Off the Record, at which I gave the keynote address, marked the digitisation of the whole Audio Arts archive – soon to be available online {{in the form of a}} stand-alone website to include 150 of <b>my</b> <b>interviews.</b> In 2009 I won an IVCA (International Visual Communications Association) award for my series of online TV interviews with artists for The Art Newspaper in collaboration with Spike TV. <b>My</b> <b>interviews</b> have also been published in a wide range of journals and books including the recently republished Talking of Art 1 (Ridinghouse/Art Monthly, 2009; 2 nd edition 2013) ...|$|R
40|$|Mid-Twentieth Century Modern Dance in the Twenty-First CenturyThe {{relevance}} of modern dance being performed today {{has been a}} growing topic in the dance field as legacy companies age and the field of contemporary dance continues to expand. This thesis begins with critical response to mid-century modern dance {{in the work of}} well-known dance critics John Martin, Edwin Denby and Louis Horst and how they substantiated modern dance’s place in dance history. <b>My</b> <b>interviews</b> with dance critics Alastair Macaulay and Sarah Kaufman discuss how the intention of dance writing has changed over the years and I examine the impact that some of those changes may have had on the state of modern dance in America today. I also discuss <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> with artistic directors of the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Limón Dance Company. I examine their ideas about finding unique approaches to engage and grow a newer, younger audience while maintaining a connection with their current fan base. They attempt to combat what some critics have identified as mid-century modern dance losing relevance with today’s dance audience. My research inspired a concert presentation on April 25, 2017, involving my restaging of a mid-century modern dance masterpiece in tandem with a premiere of my own choreography inspired by the same themes. This product is my response to contextualizing older work andgiving the audience a reference point for understanding new choreography. The final aspect of this paper explains my creative process of how I put the ideas of critics and artistic directors into action. I discuss restaging and choreographing through the inspiration of <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> and research and how that work provided ideas which enabled me to build an evening of work to better engage an audience with mid-century modern dance and contemporary choreography...|$|R
30|$|In {{informal}} talk at events or in <b>my</b> <b>interviews,</b> stories about past {{successes and failures}} had an important function.

In <b>my</b> biographical <b>interviews</b> with company founders, they were often invoked to account and legitimate the choices the funders had made in building their company. Serial entrepreneurs referred to their own past experiences, but also novice entrepreneurs would refer to a set of well-known and well re-hearsed stories. Some of these stories were about obvious failures, but interestingly, some were also about companies whose trajectory officially had been labelled a success, but which were discussed as a failure to be avoided behind the scenes.|$|R

In <b>my</b> <b>interviews,</b> I found affective connections which I explored as keywords. These keywords express affects that, in part, create the affective networks of queer performance participants...|$|R
