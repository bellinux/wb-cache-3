5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|A {{similarly}} sympathetic view {{prevails in}} more recent literature. The novel The Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence has a protagonist named Hagar <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Bram, whose life story loosely imitates that of the biblical Hagar. A character named Hagar is prominently featured in Toni Morrison's novel Song of Solomon, which features numerous Biblical themes and allusions. Hagar is mentioned briefly in Salman Rushdie's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, where Mecca is replaced with 'Jahilia', a desert village built on sand and served by Hagar's spring. Hagar is mentioned, along with Bilhah and Zilpah, in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, a controversial dystopian novel which centres around the women whose duty it is to produce children for their masters, assuming the place of their wives. In the recent book of nonfiction, , by Charlotte Gordon provides an account of Hagar's life {{from the perspectives of}} the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Rafia Zakaria, a {{director}} for Amnesty International USA, {{wrote that the}} themes of guilt and gratitude also feature prominently. She used the backstory of Parwana, Abdullah and Pari's stepmother, and her sister Masooma as an example: [...] "We find a poignant tale of a plain twin whose single act of vengeance, of pushing her pretty sister off a swing results in a lifelong moral burden. The sister, who was to be <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> both sisters love, becomes an invalid for life, and both serve the sentence, the healthy one tending {{to the other and}} wrecked within by the knowledge that she was the cause of their collective misfortune." [...] She stated the theme of dependence also extended to the story of Nabi, the brother of Parwana who arranges the selling of Pari and who is later left as the sole caretaker of his paralyzed employer.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene in}} Mouna Ragam when Manohar tries to declare {{his love for}} Divya through the college {{intercom}} (in response to her challenge) was parodied in Thamizh Padam (2010), with Shiva and Disha Pandey. A Telugu film, also entitled Mouna Ragam, was released in 2010 but was unconnected to Ratnam's film. Rangan compared Mouna Ragam to the Hindi film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999); in both films [...] "the disengaged wife was tempted, at several points, to snap free of matrimony, but what held her back, eventually, was the innate decency of the man she married". Vallamai Tharayo (2008) was compared by critics to Mouna Ragam because it also features a woman (Chaya Singh) reluctantly <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> (R. Parthiepan) whom she does not love; Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com called it [...] "a dull reworking" [...] of Mouna Ragam. Neelima Menon of The New Indian Express called Yathrakarude Sradhakku (2002) a [...] "watered-down version" [...] of Mouna Ragam. Singer Krish said that his acting debut Puriyadha Anandam Puthithaga Arambam (2015) was a line from [...] "Chinna Chinna Vanna Kuyil". Actress Sri Divya called Revathi's character her [...] "all-time favorite role", saying that she played a similar role in Mallela Theeram Lo Sirimalle Puvvu (2013). Actor Karthi said that his character in Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) was similar to Karthik's [...] "moody yet jovial" [...] character in Mouna Ragam. Writing for Mint, Nandini Ramnath compared Tanu Weds Manu (2011) to Mouna Ragam because of the similar relationship between their male and female leads. Footage from Mouna Ragam was used in Romeo Juliet (2015). The Hindu S. Shiva Kumar wrote in his review of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), [...] "A carefree and cheerful girl whose boyfriend dies {{on the day of}} the wedding is forced to marry a staid suitor by the father who suffers a heart attack. The similarity [...] ends there." ...|$|E

2500|$|White Americans were {{statistically}} {{the least likely}} to wed interracially, though in absolute terms they were involved in interracial marriages more than any other racial group due to their demographic majority.
