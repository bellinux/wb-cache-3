40|$|Before a {{business}} decides {{to start up}} or expand operations in a given locality, it {{must take into account}} the total tax burden on the investment, and how it affects the potential return. Heavy tax burdens can drive away investment to other locales and with it, the associated economic benefits. Comparing tax burdens is thus important for businesses and the governments that seek to attract them. Yet there are gaps in the way Canadian governments measure the tax burden on business investment. They ignore provincial and <b>municipal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> and land transfer taxes. In this study, we find this to be a large oversight: total business property and land transfer taxes represent about two-thirds of the total tax wedge on investment in Canada, mainly because of provincial and <b>municipal</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes.</b> Using this more complete measure, we estimate the tax burdens of the largest cities in each province. We find that Saint John, Charlottetown, and Montreal have the highest total tax rates. Calgary and Saskatoon lead the pack with the most competitive all-inclusive taxes.

Empirical hedonic pricing model estimates for a Michigan Community suggest that the optimal lot size for recently sold property is lower than current zoning on existing properties. The possibility that municipal revenue can be enhanced through greater zoning density hints of a cost associated with exclusionary zoning.
