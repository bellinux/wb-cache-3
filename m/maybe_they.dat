5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, {{was the head of}} the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.|$|E
500|$|Female {{smoking is}} a taboo in North Korea and is {{considered}} even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to [...] "react with shock if you joke that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> secretly smoke in bathrooms". Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50 is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas. In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity that men who do not smoke can become outsiders at workplaces.|$|E

500|$|Accounts of McCool in his Somerset period portray {{him as a}} {{thoughtful}} but slightly aloof character. [...] "Off the field he was a quiet man," [...] wrote David Foot. He was [...] "a contemplative pipe-smoker {{in the corner of}} the dressing room," [...] says another account, and somewhat intolerant of others who appeared less committed than he was. [...] "Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't relish the way he treated them. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own." ...|$|E
500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|With the slowing of {{the global}} economy due to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010, the company experienced a downside of focusing so much on this demographic group. The high unemployment of the recession, coupled with healthier eating habits, drove many customers away from fast food towards the fast-casual segment or forced them to stop eating out. Analysts have stated that by focusing its marketing and advertising programs on men, BK alienated women and children. Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass stated, [...] "Maybe catering to the super fan was the correct strategy to kick-start the business, but <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> relied on that for too long..." ...|$|E

Whatever <b>they</b> <b>maybe</b> made of, <b>they</b> are certainly not 'stars' as Apelles suggests, since, as he himself shows, they cannot be observed making regular orbits of the sun.|$|R
6000|$|Hendricks {{shut the}} {{transmitter}} up. [...] "No use. No answer. Radiation pools? <b>Maybe.</b> Or <b>they</b> hear me, but won't answer.

500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} home {{belonged to}} a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20 month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek. He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know {{this kind of thing}} existed. How can a country like this allow it? <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> just don't know." [...] Clark labeled what lay before them a [...] "national disgrace." [...] Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry.|$|E
500|$|XCOM: Enemy Unknown was {{developed}} independently of 2K Marin's XCOM (later rebranded as [...] ), {{and although the}} two games are set in entirely different universes, the developers of both games were in contact with one another, As in the expansion Enemy Within, after researching Meld it says Dr. Vahlen discovered some records from the 60s which shows that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> {{were in the same}} universe. Enemy Unknown was also the first title developed by Firaxis Games not to feature the name of Sid Meier, who served as the director of creative development but was not directly involved in the game's development day to day. The designers also made an internal board game to help get the [...] "feel" [...] of the game right.|$|E

5000|$|... "There {{were lots}} of hacks out there who said we couldn't do it anymore", remarked Mick Jagger. [...] "But <b>maybe</b> what <b>they</b> meant was they couldn't do it anymore. Anyway, once we started playing, all that died down. You {{can talk about it}} and talk about it - but, once we're onstage, the {{question}} is answered." ...|$|R
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can just {{take a little bit of}} it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets {{a little hard to}} have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E
50|$|The swords are {{frequently}} mentioned throughout the books as curved blades, {{and on the}} two UK hardback covers, are depicted as katanas. However, the swords are also described as being scabbarded in a single, curved sheath roughly five feet in length. This would suggest shorter weapons, such as short sabres or <b>maybe</b> as <b>they</b> are being depicted as katana they could be kodachi.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight worse'n dead people. Dead {{people might}} talk, <b>maybe,</b> but <b>they</b> don't come sliding {{around in a}} shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your {{shoulder}} {{all of a sudden}} and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could." ...|$|R

500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E
500|$|Wondering {{why he has}} {{not seen}} any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office {{assistant}} Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film I Am Legend, [...] "You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!" [...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order {{to figure out what}} is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her [...] "future husband", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with [...] "Cool Runnings, man! Bobsled!" [...] This is a reference to the comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song [...] "Fuck the Pain Away" [...] by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.|$|E
500|$|In 138 matches {{across the}} five seasons for Somerset, McCool made 7,913 runs {{at an average}} of 33.82. He also took 219 wickets at 28.05 but in his five years with the county he was never the first-choice spin bowler: in his first two seasons, Somerset used Australian-born slow left-arm {{orthodox}} bowler John McMahon as the main spin bowler, with young off-spin bowler Brian Langford also bowling more than McCool. When McMahon left, Langford took over as the top spin bowler, and by 1960 was bowling four times the number of overs that McCool took. But McCool had also lost some of his control at this stage: [...] "He could do beguiling things with the ball, though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration," [...] says the history of Somerset cricket. He also made 146 catches, many of them at first slip, where he stood [...] "rather deeper than usual". His influence on Somerset's recovery from the trough of the early 1950s was considerable. A later Somerset history says: [...] "Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't relish the way he treated them. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own. But their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable." ...|$|E

50|$|As can be seen, such an {{increase}} in prices would induce a certain substitution for our hypothetical firm, in fact, 200 units less will be sold. This may be so because some consumers have started to buy a substitute product, the same consumers have bought a smaller quantity of the product given its price increase or <b>maybe</b> because <b>they</b> have stopped from buying that type of product.|$|R
500|$|However, Ryan Book of Music Times, {{was less}} {{critical}} with his review: [...] " [...] {{took a break}} from colorful music videos {{to make a statement}} of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown {{at the end of the}} song". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] is [...] "one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song [...] "is a jarring buzz kill – and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if it such a shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate". [...] A review from Traxionary described [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that [...] "beauty" [...] can be [...] "black or white/yellow or green"". In an extremely positive review of the track, Mike Usinger writing for The Georgia Straight, claimed that [...] " [...] a surprisingly soulful duet with Andre 3000, Stefani has come up with the kind of solo album that gets singers thinking that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> don't need a backing band at all," [...] referencing Stefani's time spent with No Doubt.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} in trade publications, with Paul's garb being {{cited as the}} weakest aspect by two {{different}} reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, [...] and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, [...] "It is usually good advice to tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul in this piece to take his shirt off {{the next time he}} essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral." [...] The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
