5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
2500|$|He {{played in}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England, where Zimbabwe beat Kenya, India and South Africa {{to qualify for the}} [...] "Super Six" [...] stage. He {{obtained}} his best Test bowling figures of 8–109 in the 1st innings against New Zealand at Bulawayo in 2000-1, although Zimbabwe lost the match by 7 wickets. This remains the best bowling figures recorded by a Zimbabwean in an innings in Test cricket (the best match figures belong to Adam Huckle). He only played in three further Tests, with his international career curtailed by a chronic injury to the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actually…he had been a gymnast and the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in the front seat and my sister, Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{questioned}} by police, Bychkov {{claimed that he}} ate livers, hearts and <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims.|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Cuff {{looked up}} at me--flat against the wall--without {{stirring}} a hand, or moving a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> melancholy face.|$|R
60|$|The man {{had listened}} without moving a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. There was {{something}} almost pitiable in its white, sullen despair. Then his lips parted.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} them and {{it seemed as though}} imps were {{twitching}} the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. He looked his question.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{bent forward}} {{and touched his}} hand. He started {{as though he had}} been burned. The <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> throat were working.|$|E
60|$|The boatman greeted this {{peremptory}} interlocutor {{with a cool}} laugh--a strange laugh, {{in which}} the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face appeared not to play.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin saw nothing, {{but he did}} {{not move}} a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. A moment later they heard the Prince's voice from behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} see you, sir,' {{observed}} the major, shaking hands with Martin, and not moving a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. 'You are pretty bright, I hope?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gerald, {{trying not}} to let a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face relax; though now the die was cast, his consternation {{at the thought of}} school was considerable.|$|R
60|$|Domiloff {{was beside}} himself. His black eyes burned like live coals, his cheeks were pallid almost to ghastliness, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face were twitching.|$|E
6000|$|... "The smith, {{a mighty}} man is he [...] With large and sinewy hands; And the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brawny arms [...] Are strong as iron bands." ...|$|E
60|$|Andre-Louis came slowly {{forward until}} he reached the table on the other side, and then at last the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> set face relaxed, and he laughed.|$|E
60|$|A light {{like the}} {{flashing}} of fire upon polished steel lit {{up for a}} moment those strange-colored eyes. Yet in other respects the man was unmoved. Not a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face twitched.|$|R
60|$|This walk {{towards them}} was the most courageous act of old Jolyon's life; but no <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face moved, no nervous gesture betrayed him. He kept his deep-set eyes {{steadily}} on the enemy.|$|R
60|$|E23, {{not moving}} a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> countenance, {{answered}} with a stream of the filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It {{reminded him of the}} drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first schooling.|$|R
60|$|The prince {{heard and}} shook, his cheeks sank in, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great form seemed to collapse, and he grovelled {{on the floor}} of the hut.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. You {{cease to}} bother about {{a great many}} things.' Again Maurice {{stretched}} his figure, stretched the strong <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back, and leaned backwards, with uplifted face.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms quiver, and pressed more closely against them. They were strong arms, {{protecting}} arms, restful {{to lean against}} at the journey's end.|$|E
60|$|Jacob {{came out}} from the dark place by the window where he had hovered. The light poured over him, {{illuminating}} every cranny <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skin; but not a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face moved as he sat looking out into the garden.|$|R
60|$|Penelope's {{eyes were}} {{suddenly}} upraised. For {{the first time}} Mr. Coulson's ready answers failed him. Not a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face moved under the girl's scrutiny, but he hesitated {{for a short time}} before he answered her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you dare}} to hint to me, then," [...] he cried, every <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body quivering with just horror, [...] "that you told my own {{daughter}} {{you thought you}} had reason to suspect her own mother's early antecedents?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused; {{the light}} vein of humour {{which he had}} tried to assume passed off, and there was a {{twitching}} about the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth as he resumed-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stiffened}} {{his whole}} right leg, as with another spasm, hurting his real minor cramps, but flexing the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> upper leg into the seeming hardness of cramp.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} perfectly still, {{staring at}} the immense and ruddy moon, {{the only thing in}} the far-reaching darkness of the level. His heart beat heavily, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms contracted.|$|E
60|$|I {{was looking}} at him; not a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face moved in the least. And yet, even at the time, I did not suspect him of insensibility. It {{was a sort of}} rapt thoughtfulness. Then he stirred slightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay a moment," [...] said Sergeant Drooce, when I {{had told}} him, without causing a {{movement}} in a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face: [...] "look to your pouch, my lad. You Tom Packer, look to your pouch, confound you! Look to your pouches, all you Marines." ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} on October 31, 2012 that male lead Kim Jaewon injured the <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right thigh while shooting a quarreling scene. He {{was taken to}} hospital for examination {{at the completion of}} filming, received treatment and has since returned to the regular shooting schedule.|$|R
60|$|Jean {{recognized}} the dry, drawling voice of Greaves, and {{the shock of}} it seemed to contract the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> whole thrilling body, {{like that of a}} panther about to spring.|$|E
60|$|The sailing-master was powerfully {{affected}} by this kind offer, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hard, weatherbeaten face working convulsively, {{and it was a}} moment before he could trust his voice in reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's lucky I was beginnin' to mend {{before we}} was catched," [...] said Disco, feeling the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legs; [...] "true, I ain't much to boast of yet but I'm improvin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] {{said the}} spy, {{dropping}} his soft {{voice to a}} tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wicked face: [...] "I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph did {{not allow}} a <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face to {{indicate}} that he heard one word of this parting address. He hardly {{knew that it was}} concluded, and Mrs Nickleby had scarcely made up her mind to detain her son by force if necessary, when Nicholas was gone.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "What {{makes my}} Thinker {{think is that}} he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his {{distended}} nostrils and compressed lips, but with every <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms, back and legs, with his clenched fists and gripping toes." [...] - Auguste Rodin, sculptor of The Thinker ...|$|R
