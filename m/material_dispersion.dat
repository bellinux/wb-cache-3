2500|$|Dispersion {{occurs when}} {{different}} frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to material properties (<b>material</b> <b>dispersion)</b> {{or to the}} geometry of an optical waveguide (waveguide dispersion). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease in index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent materials. This is called [...] "normal dispersion". It occurs in all dielectric materials, in wavelength ranges where the material does not absorb light. In wavelength ranges where a medium has significant absorption, the index of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called [...] "anomalous dispersion".|$|E

50|$|In a {{single-mode}} optical fiber, the zero-dispersion wavelength is {{the wavelength}} or wavelengths at which <b>material</b> <b>dispersion</b> and waveguide dispersion cancel one another. In all silica-based optical fibers, minimum <b>material</b> <b>dispersion</b> occurs naturally at a wavelength of approximately 1300 nm. Single-mode fibers may be made of silica-based glasses containing dopants that shift the material-dispersion wavelength, and thus, the zero-dispersion wavelength, toward the minimum-loss window at approximately 1550 nm. The engineering tradeoff is {{a slight increase in}} the minimum attenuation coefficient. Such fiber is called dispersion-shifted fiber.|$|E

50|$|<b>Material</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{can be a}} {{desirable}} or undesirable effect in optical applications. The dispersion of light by glass prisms is used to construct spectrometers and spectroradiometers. Holographic gratings are also used, as they allow more accurate discrimination of wavelengths. However, in lenses, dispersion causes chromatic aberration, an undesired effect that may degrade images in microscopes, telescopes, and photographic objectives.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{mechanisms}} which can generate slow light, {{all of which}} create narrow spectral regions with high dispersion, i.e. peaks in the dispersion relation. Schemes are generally grouped into two categories: <b>material</b> <b>dispersion</b> and waveguide dispersion. <b>Material</b> <b>dispersion</b> mechanisms such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), coherent population oscillation (CPO), and various four-wave mixing (FWM) schemes produce a rapid change in refractive index {{as a function of}} optical frequency, i.e. they modify the temporal component of a propagating wave. This is done by using a nonlinear effect to modify the dipole response of a medium to a signal or [...] "probe" [...] field. Waveguide dispersion mechanisms such as photonic crystals, coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW), and other micro-resonator structures modify the spatial component (k-vector) of a propagating wave. Slowlight can also be achieved by exploiting the dispersion properties of planar waveguides realized with single negative metamaterials (SNM) or double negative metamaterials (DNM).|$|E
