Results were analysed of one aspect of the "North Coast Healthy Lifestyle Programme" entitled "Quit for Life," which aimed at reducing cigarette smoking over a two year period. There was a significant decline in the prevalence of smoking in both test towns, ranging from 16 % in younger men to 6 % in older women.

Twenty-two parents of children with developmental disabilities and conduct problems (the disability group), and 17 parents of children with conduct problems, but without developmental disabilities (the conduct problems group), were assessed before and after participating in the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme,</b> and at 10 months follow-up. More than 70 % of cases in both the disability and conduct problems groups showed clinically significant improvement on the Total Difficulties scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. During the follow-up period, parents in the disability group showed a deterioration in psychological adjustment (on the General Health Questionnaire- 12), while parents in the conduct problems group showed an improvement. Parents in the disability group reported a higher level of goal attainment compared with parents in the conduct problem group. Parents in both the disability and conduct problems groups evaluated the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme</b> equally positively. The Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme</b> requires refinement to become more effective for families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> with families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities and significant behavioural problems in the Irish health service. The Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> is a group-based parent training package involving video modelling, which was designed to be effective for children with conduct problems, but without developmental disabilities. Materials and Methods: Pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted with 22 treated cases and 19 waiting-list controls with a protocol that included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Child Behaviour Checklist, the General Health Questionnaire- 12, the Kansas Parental Satisfaction Scale, the Family Assessment Device, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes, the Parenting Stress Index and the Questionnaire on Resources and Stress. Results: Following the treatment, a comparison of treatment and control group means showed that the treated group showed better adjustment on the total difficulties scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. These gains were maintained at 10 -month follow-up. Fifty per cent of treated cases showed clinically significant improvement and 14 % showed reliable change on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The treatment group reported a high level of satisfaction with the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> and showed significant goal attainment after treatment and at follow-up. Conclusions: For some families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities and significant behavioural problems, the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> is an effective intervention and may be incorporated into routine early intervention clinics in the Irish health service. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. Methods and design The {{purpose of this study is}} to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. Discussion The planned development of the Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties.
