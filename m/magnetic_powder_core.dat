The <b>powder</b> <b>cores</b> are Molypermalloy Core (MPC), High Flux Core (HFC), and Kool Mu Core (KMC). The performance of four inductors utilizing these cores has been evaluated {{as a function of}} temperature from 20 C to - 180 C. All cores were wound with the same wire type and gauge to obtain equal values of inductance at room temperature. Each inductor was evaluated in terms of its inductance, quality (Q) factor, resistance, and dynamic hysteresis characteristics (B-H loop) as a function of temperature and frequency. Both sinusoidal and square wave excitations were used in these investigations. Measured data obtained on the inductance showed that both the MPC and the HFC cores maintain a constant inductance value, whereas with the KMC and ferrite core hold a steady value in inductance with frequency but decrease as temperature is decreased. All cores exhibited dependency, with varying degrees, in their quality factor and resistance on test frequency and temperature.

The core shows an enhanced effective magnetic permeability of 66 after longitude magnetic field annealing at an applied field of 30 Oe and temperature of 400 degrees C, which is attributed to the relief of internal stress and the variation of atomic structure. The permeability was improved by 8 % and the frequency stability of FeSiB amorphous <b>powder</b> <b>core</b> is up to 2 MHz.

40|$|A thin, {{insulating}} layer with high electrical resistivity {{is vital to}} achieving high performance of <b>powder</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores.</b> Using layer-by-layer deposition of silica nanosheets or colloidal silica over {{insulating layer}}s composed of strontium phosphate and boron oxide, we succeeded in fabricating insulating layers with high electrical resistivity on iron powder particles, which were subsequently used to prepare toroidal cores. The compact density of these cores decreased after coating with colloidal silica due to the substantial increase in the volume, causing the magnetic flux density to deteriorate. Coating with silica nanosheets, on the other hand, resulted in a higher electrical resistivity and a good balance between high magnetic flux density and low iron loss due to the thinner silica layers. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that {{the thickness of the}} colloidal silica coating was about 700 nm, while that of the silica nanosheet coating was 30 nm.
