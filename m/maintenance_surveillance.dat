40|$|In {{recent years}} many {{electric}} utilities {{and nuclear power}} plants adopted policies for improved coordination of both safety and non-safety programs, called plant life management (PLIM), also in view on plant life extension programs, but mainly for an optimisation of operating costs. The implementation of PLIM programs has followed many different approaches, being intrinsically dependent on the national regulatory framework and technical traditions. In Countries with some experience, the PLIM program proved very convenient, especially when coupled with <b>Maintenance,</b> <b>Surveillance</b> an Inspection (MS&I) optimization: average savings are reported {{in the range of}} 20 - 30 % of total (maintenance) costs. A unified European model for PLIM was developed at the JRC-Institute for Energy with the support of a network of stakeholders (SENUF), and validated at some EU nuclear plants. This paper provides a summary of the model features, the result of its validation at some plants and summarises the perceived scientific/technological challenges for the FP 7 on which JRC proposes to focus, based upon its competencies and skills, having in mind both the European and world-wide context and its potential evolution.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of dam failure can be catastrophic. Dams are constructed for various purposes such as hydropower generation, irrigation or municipal water supply, recreational use and storage of mining waste etc. In most cases, {{it is not}} only the services provided by the dam that are in jeopardy, due to the failure of the dam, but also endangered are lives, property, the community and its economic well-being and the environment. Many catastrophic dam failures have occurred around the world and many countries have taken steps to minimize the risks to the community posed by dams by establishing statutory authorities to regulate the safety of dams. In ensuring the structural safety of a dam; safe operation, proper maintenance, regular surveillance (inspections and monitoring) and the review of safety throughout the life of the dam are as equally important as the assurance of quality in design and construction of the dam.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to examine the relationship}} between time-dependent degradation and current industry practices in the areas of <b>maintenance,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and operation of steam turbine drives for safety-related pumps. These pumps are located in the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system for pressurized-water reactor plants and in the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling and High-Pressure Coolant Injection systems for boiling-water reactor plants. This research has been conducted by examination of failure data in the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System, review of Licensee Event Reports, discussion of problems with operating plant personnel, and personal observation. The reported failure data were reviewed to determine the cause of the event and the method of discovery. Based on the research results, attempts have been made to determine the predictability of failures and possible preventive measures that may be implemented. Findings in a recent study of AFW systems indicate that the turbine drive is the single largest contributor to AFW system degradation. However, examination of the data shows that the turbine itself is a reliable piece of equipment with a good service record. Most of the problems documented are the result of problems with the turbine controls and the mechanical overspeed trip mechanism; these apparently stem from three major causes which are discussed in the text. Recent improvements in maintenance practices and procedures, combined with a stabilization of the design, have led to improved performance resulting in a reliable safety-related component. However, these improvements have not been universally implemented...|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by social}} and {{economical}} issues, {{over the last}} 20 years, many nuclear power plant owners started a program for the longterm operation (LTO) /plant life management (PLIM) of their older nuclear facilities. A PLIM framework requires both a detailed review {{of the features of}} the main safety programs; <b>maintenance,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and in-service inspection (MS&I); and a complete integration of these safety programs into the general management system of the plant. Therefore, PLIM should address safety, as well as economics, knowledge management, and decision making and provide an overall framework to keep the whole plant in a safe and economically sustainable condition. Moreover, the existence of new external factors, such as extensive use of subcontractors, need for efficient management of spare parts, and request for heavy plant refurbishment programs, demands for updated techniques in the overall management of the plant. Therefore, new organizational models have to be developed to appropriately support the PLIM framework. In recent years, a network of European research organizations (SENUF) carried out many R&D tasks aimed at capturing the aspects of the maintenance programs, where research is mostly needed and at developing suitable optimized maintenance models. Using the outcome of these initiatives, this paper aims at identifying the technical attributes of the PLIM program more directly affecting the decision for a long term safe operation of a nuclear facility and the issues related to its optimal implementation. A comparison of some of the available models is presented and an analysis of the potential impact on safety and nonsafety programs is provided in order to support the development of optimized life management models.

40|$|The Plutonium Facility (TA- 55) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{has been}} in {{operation}} for over 15 years. It handles projects such as: stockpile <b>maintenance,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and dismantlement; pit rebuild; plutonium power source fabrication for long duration spacecraft missions (e. g., Cassini); nuclear materials technology research; nuclear materials storage; and remediation of nuclear waste. The Operations Center of TA- 55 is the nerve center of the facility where operators are on duty around the clock and monitor several thousand data points using the Facility Control System (FCS). The FCS monitors, displays, alarms, and provides some limited control of the following systems; HVAC, fire detection and suppression, radiation detection, electrical, and other miscellaneous systems. The FCS was originally based on late 1970 s digital technology, which is not longer supported by the vendors. Additionally, the equipment failure rates increased notably in the 1990 s. Thus, plans were put into place to upgrade and replace the FCS hardware, software, and display components with modernized equipment. The process was complicated by the facts that: the facility was operational {{and could not be}} totally closed for the modifications; complete documentation was not available for the existing system; the Safety Analyses for the facility {{were in the process of}} being upgraded at the same time; and of course limited time and budgets.

40|$|Managing {{nuclear power}} plant aging {{is one of the}} {{important}} technical issues which needs to be addressed by utilities in order to extend the operating life of some of the early LWR power stations. Plant managers must understand complex aging phenomena, identify aging effects, anticipate failure, and mitigate the aging process. Typically, the age-related design limits of crucial components are not known, and this information usually {{does not appear to be}} easily available from the equipment vendor. Electrical cables, insulation and instrumentation are most susceptible to age-related degradation. material degradation due to corrosion is the main costly problem affecting a small but important portion of piping and major equipment. Upgrading the plant, replacing aging equipment, and implementing good <b>maintenance,</b> <b>surveillance</b> and spare parts inventory control programs are actions a utility can take to extend the life of operating nuclear plants. Considerable institutional uncertainties are associated with nuclear plant life extension. These spring mainly from the absence of clearly defined policies by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating the technical and procedural requirements for plant life extension. From precedents established to-date, it is reasonable to expect plant operation to be permitted for most plants for a total of 40 years after start of commerical operation. As a large share of the net discounted benefits of extended life operation may be derived from the first decade of additional life, the basis for utility investments for life extension is thus assured. -i-In planning for life extensions beyond ten years it is useful to consider that the plant would be operated into the future indefinitely, and that it should be maintained so as to maximize efficiency and safety. -ii-ACKNOWEDGEMENTS This research was conducted under the sponsorship of Northeas...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} algorithm for functional system reliability influence on the aircraft technical maintenance. The research results which allow to estimate the functional system reliability influence on the aircraft tech- nical maintenance process are provided. The aircraft maintenance process effectiveness implies the maintenance procedures including pre-flight preparation, the flight itself, technical maintenance and storage. The research was aimed at forecasting the aircraft technical maintenance process considering the functional system reliability, with special attention payed to failure-free operation. The term failure-free operation stands for the ability to execute a required function within a given time interval at given conditions. The objects of maintenance -aircraft functional systems and their components have a great degree of failure-free operation, {{which has been a}} design requirement and is supported at aircraft maintenance and operation. Failures and mal- functions are seldom events. This fact leads to a limited statistic <b>maintenance</b> <b>surveillance</b> database. Classical methods of statistical analyses do not provide the sufficient fiducial probability for functional system failure-free operation estimation. Thus these methods do not allow to estimate its influence on the aircraft technical maintenance process effectiveness. In order to solve this problem it is suggested to use the method of flow diagrams and random sample statistical method for failure-free operation estimation-statistical modeling (Monte-Carlo Method). Reliability flow diagram method allowed to determine the functional system failure-free operation random sample dependence on the technical maintenance frequency. The initial data were: the functional system flow diagram, the list of the main equipment, functional system equipment failure random sample data. The use of statistical modeling allowed to estimate the dependence of functional system reliability (failure-free operation) on the technical maintenance frequency for expanded statistical database (a num- ber of functional system maintenance and operation procedures) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. This study {{intended}} {{to explore the}} phenomenon of managing school safety in the primary school. The aim was first achieved by exploring the essence of school safety through a literature review. Secondly, an empirical {{study was conducted to}} investigate the status of safety in the primary schools. Finally, recommendations on how safety can be managed in primary schools are made. The literature review exposed a theoretical perspective of school safety based on the socio-ecological perspective of the school, which approaches the school safety as a function of people's interaction with their environment. In this regard, the school environment was revealed as comprising the physical and psychosocial environment. School safety was thus found to be related to school stakeholders' interaction with their physical and psychosocial environments. In this regard, the safety of the physical environment was found to be a function of all actions aimed at the <b>maintenance,</b> <b>surveillance</b> and safety systems and procedures. The safety of the psychosocial environment was found to be a function of actions aimed at creating safe social and psychological climates. The empirical research found that there were perceptions of safety in primary schools. However, it was clear that there was poor or no coordination of programmes aimed at school safety. For instance, it could be deduced that school safety was seen as an ad hoc function, which was addressed as the need arose. There were no perceptions of the existence of well coordinated and purposeful safety planning, implementation and monitoring processes. Recommendations focus mainly on ensuring that schools address school safety in a coordinated and well-planned manner. This includes school safety planning and advocacy to bring school safety on the nation's agenda. This way stakeholder involvement and in essence, state involvement is advocated so as ultimately to have a centralised school safety coordinating agency, which would be instrumental in providing resources and advocating resource sharing among schools.
