5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E

She spent decades campaigning to have the names of her husband Giuseppe and son Gerry cleared over the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) pub bombings at Guildford and Woolwich, and helped secure an apology from former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2005 for their wrongful imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This was clearly not the case with Dietrich.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 {{to determine whether there}} was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> that had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 1868, Khrimian {{was ordained}} as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 {{he was elected}} as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian {{community}} of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) class and the imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet {{in the eyes of}} the Sublime Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used the position to advance the interests and conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E
5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a <b>miscarriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> in English legal history. The murder {{occurred}} outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.|$|E
