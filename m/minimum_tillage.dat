40|$|The Bremer river catchment, on the South-coast of Western Australia, {{is typical}} of most river {{catchments}} in this region in {{that it has been}} seriously affected by sedimentation, salinisation and eutrophication brought on by the gradual dominance of agricultural land management practices. Vegetated rehabilitation and changed agricultural land management practices (ie <b>minimum</b> / zero <b>tillage)</b> have now been widely adopted throughout the catchment in response to these degradation issues. This study examined the potential impact <b>minimum</b> / zero <b>tillage,</b> vegetated rehabilitation and remnant vegetation could have on both a farm and catchment wide scale. A Geographical Information System was developed to identify spatial variability evident throughout the catchment. Three zones were developed by the system to account for spatial variability. Field studies were undertaken to sample the surface runoff flow from areas under the Remnant Vegetation, Vegetated Rehabilitation and <b>Minimum</b> / Zero <b>Tillage</b> land management practice {{in each of the three}} zones. Runoff was sampled using a modified Gerlach trough. Runoff sampling was synchronised with the occurrence of the first rainfall I runoff event of the year. Phosphorus, sediment and salt concentrations were the main parameters analysed in the runoff samples collected. Following statistical analysis, the results for these parameters were extrapolated to a load per hectare figure. Further analysis of the catchment GIS was undertaken to determine the area of each zone and areas under each land practice in each zone. Two series of modelling scenarios, using the extrapolated load data, were used to determine the immediate and long term restorative effects increasing areas of vegetated rehabilitation could have on both a zone and catchment basis. This study concluded that <b>minimum</b> / zero <b>tillage</b> in the catchment, in combination with further wide-spread adoption of vegetated rehabilitation will have the capacity to reduce catchment degradation caused by eutrophication and sedimentation. Its extensive implementation can address these two forms of degradation by decreasing runoff concentrations of phosphorus and sediment. Salinity problems in the catchment will be indirectly effected through resulting changes to the groundwater table. Additional changes to current land management practices are also necessary for instance fertility testing and fertiliser application-on-need should be incorporated into the <b>minimum</b> / zero <b>tillage</b> land management practice if they haven 2 ̆ 7 t been already...|$|R

Cartographic documents and QuickBird satellite images were also used to generate the final index maps for agrodiversity, fallow intensity and green manure use intensity. A high diversity of crops was observed. In some land units up to 40 plant species were recorded. However, this diversity was not uniformly distributed throughout the terrain. A high intensity of land use, mostly with annuals was also observed in a large part of the area. In most cases, fallow periods were up to 3 months in 3 years.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{development}} of a sustainable agriculture {{requires the use of}} agricultural practices that involve a <b>minimum</b> soil <b>tillage.</b> The cropping systems change the dynamics of native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and these, on the other hand, determine the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhiza on crop responses to lime and fertilizers and on the efficiency of the cropping system itself. Density of those native fungi in the soil is similar in both till and no-till planting systems and decreases with soil depth, being higher at 0 cm- 10 cm. Under no-till system, the external mycelium, developed during the former cropping, is preserved and possibly stimulating the rapid plant root colonization of the following crop. In the first years, grain yield showed to be higher in conventional cropping system with soil tillage. Though, with the increase of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community afterwards, the grain yield increases for both planting systems, and, become similar for the conventional till and no-till planting systems. Under no-tillage cropping system, arbuscular mycorrhizal contribution to plant growth occurs mainly in the 0 cm - 5 cm depth superficial soil layer. 200...|$|R

In the plant crop in both experiments, tillage produced a highly significant increase in cane and sugar yield {{but there was no}} effect of row spacing. The response to tillage could be attributed to the removal of compaction caused by harvester and haul-outs during the previous cycle.

A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics, such as age, education, farm size, soil type, weather, and location of a research farm, were included as explanatory variables. The primary data source for the empirical analysis was farm level data from the Agriculture and Population Census data from 1991, 1996, and 2001, which resulted in over 42, 000 observations in the data set. A number of model specifications and sensitivity analyses were run and the results obtained were consistent with one another, thus the findings presented in this thesis are robust. A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics are significant in determining whether <b>minimum</b> <b>tillage</b> is adopted. These variables include: Alberta dummy variable, summerfallow, age, total farm area, gross farm sales, black, brown, and dark gray soils, corporate operating structure, time, average maximum April and June temperature, and total June precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The project website gathers {{a series}} of short videos (few minutes) on the {{characteristics}} and implementation of some innovative techniques available to organic farmers with the attempt to cope <b>minimum</b> or no <b>tillage</b> with organic farming. In this attempt weed management {{is one of the}} main challenges and the videos highlight how it can be done in practice: on which crops, with which machines, in which soil and weather conditions. It also shows the details of innovative machines (i. e. CombCut) and their potentials. The short videos intend to give a practical overview of the techniques and results but in depth descriptions and implementations are available in the project reports and publications (all on the website). In a short time the videos give a good overview of techniques. It can be used to have an idea of research done by the project and give indication on which reports and publications are available for further readin...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis {{is to compare}} the soil erodobility in {{conventional}} (CT) and soil protection <b>tillage</b> (<b>minimum</b> tillage-MT) in relation to soil organic matter (SOM) in the location of interest - Studená. The soil protection tillage has been used there since 1994 together with conventional. In 2009, the two variants of soil samples were taken from soil depths 0. 05, 0. 15 and 0. 25 m. All soil properties, which may affect erosion or which are affected by it, were analyzed from these soil samples. In particular, this thesis focuses {{on the relationship between}} tillage and soil organic matter. There were studied some chosen physical properties as specific gravity and size fraction less than 0. 01 mm just in relation to fractions of SOM and soil aggregations stability. Physical-chemical properties have been analyzed more deeply. Of these, special attention was paid to the soil organic matter by establishing a number of parametres and comparing them...|$|R
40|$|Conservation-tillage {{systems on}} the Southeastern Coastal Plain now utilize {{practices}} such as <b>minimum</b> surface <b>tillage,</b> narrow row widths, and planting of herbicide-tolerant varieties. These systems can result in many economical, environmental, and ecological benefits, including providing a more suitable habitat for wildlife such as the northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). Our research objectives were to assess the possible ecological impacts of both an innovative soybean (Glycine max L. Merr) tillage system (no-till) and traditional soybean system (tilled) on quail habitat and preference. Variables measured were insect abundance, canopy closure and pen-raised quail habitat use. No-till soybean fields {{were found to have}} the greatest abundance of orthopteran (crickets/grasshoppers), arachnid (spiders), and coleopteran/hemipteran (centipedes/beetles) insects. Insect numbers were higher in the no-till system than in the tilled system, field borders, and forested areas. The tilled system generally had the second highest number of insects, followed by field borders and forested areas. Canopy closure as estimated by light transmittance through the canopy, was faster and more complete in the no-till system than the tilled system due to the narrower row width used with the no-till system. Pen-raised quail were found more frequently in the no-till system than the tilled system a majority of the time. Greater quail use of the tilled system only occurred at one field. Field borders and forested areas were used less than either tillage systems. Averaged over treatments and release days, the greatest cause of mortality was due to mammals. These results indicate that no-till systems are more beneficial to quail than traditional systems in terms of habitat quality...|$|R
