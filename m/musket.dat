5|$|Eleven main colours are {{recognised}} by {{the breed}} association (most including many different shades): light grey, grey, white, emsket (dusky bluish-grey), <b>musket</b> (light greyish-brown), shaela (dark steely-grey), black, fawn, moorit (reddish brown), mioget (honey-toned, yellowish-brown), and dark brown.|$|E
5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from Meermin, recovering 286 muskets, 12 pistols, 5 bayonets, gunpowder, <b>musket</b> balls and compasses; cables, ropes and other items from the ship were auctioned on the shore. The ship's logbook has not survived.|$|E
5|$|The <b>musket,</b> or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because of its size. The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan under Qing {{rule the}} Hakka on Taiwan owned matchlock <b>muskets.</b> Han people traded and sold matchlock <b>muskets</b> to the Taiwanese aborigines. The Aboriginals used their matchlock <b>muskets</b> {{to defeat the}} Americans in the Formosa Expedition. During the Sino-French War the Hakka and Aboriginals used their matchlock <b>muskets</b> against the French in the Keelung Campaign and Battle of Tamsui.|$|R

50|$|The famous Janissary {{corps of}} the Ottoman army were using matchlock <b>muskets</b> {{as early as}} the 1440s. The Ottoman Empire, {{centering}} on Turkey and extending into Arabia, used <b>muskets</b> to conquer Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and were one of the earliest users of <b>muskets</b> in a military conflict. It also utilized large cannons, the Great Turkish Bombard and incendiary devices. They are also probably the first to use <b>muskets</b> aboard ships.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire. The Unity crew managed to avoid damage and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, the Unity crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged <b>musket</b> shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a <b>musket</b> shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|A {{second and}} third volume to the Huolongjing known as Huolongjing Erji (Fire Dragon Manual Volume Two) and Huolongjing Sanji (Fire Dragon Manual Volume Three) were {{published}} in 1632 with content describing weapons such as the <b>musket</b> and breech-loading cannons. After {{the end of the}} Ming dynasty, the Qing dynasty outlawed reprinting of the Huolongjing for using expressions such as 'northern barbarians,' which offended the ruling Manchu elite.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} supplies from Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well {{prepared for a}} lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand <b>musket</b> and rifle rounds and enough provisions for several months of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still intact and contained more than 6.5 million złotys.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{weapons were}} also {{deployed}} but their numbers were not counted, and these included:muzzle-loading rifled <b>muskets</b> and smoothbore <b>muskets</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|In the 18th century, {{improvements}} in ammunition and firing methods allowed rifling {{to be used}} in the military domain, and the term [...] "rifled gun" [...] gave way to [...] "rifle". In the 19th century, rifled <b>muskets</b> (which were technically rifles, but were referred to as <b>muskets)</b> became common, combining the advantages of rifles and <b>muskets.</b> About the time of the introduction of cartridge, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition just a few years later, <b>muskets</b> fell out of fashion.|$|R
5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled <b>musket.</b> Such arrows shot from a <b>musket</b> had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glasgow {{suffered}} one {{killed and}} three wounded, a low number which some {{consider to be}} evidence of poor quality in the Continental fleet's gunnery; all of the casualties were due to <b>musket</b> fire. Four were killed and seven wounded aboard Cabot; USS Alfred had six killed and six wounded, and Andrew Dorias drummer was wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few months of the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester changed hands three times, only one <b>musket</b> shot was fired, so until the start of the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval walls were not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{was originally}} armed with model 1840 <b>muskets.</b> In July 1861 {{the state of}} New York replaced these with Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle <b>muskets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{regiment}} {{received the}} blue United States uniform, {{typical of the}} civil war. [...] Initially, the regiment was armed with [...]69 caliber rifled <b>muskets,</b> altered to use a percussion cap. In 1863, the regiment saw more modern arms provisioned to the soldiers; a mixture of the Enfield rifle and Springfield Rifle <b>Muskets</b> were carried. In 1864, all troops were armed with the Springfield Rifle <b>Muskets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1840s {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of the minie ball, which allowed rifled barrels to be used with muzzle-loading black-powder weapons. Model 1840 and 1842 <b>muskets</b> were produced as smoothbore weapons, but many had their barrels rifled after production, causing them to be referred to as rifled <b>muskets.</b> Subsequent models in the series continued to be referred to as rifled <b>muskets,</b> even though they had not been produced as smoothbore weapons originally.|$|R
5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from the beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and <b>musket</b> balls, compasses and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin was left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|The first Europeans {{known to}} have reached New Zealand were Dutch {{explorer}} Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642. In a hostile encounter, four crew members were killed {{and at least one}} Māori was hit by canister shot. Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts and water. The introduction of the potato and the <b>musket</b> transformed Māori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns. The resulting intertribal <b>Musket</b> Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori. From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population. The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} the barricades {{at the front of}} the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial <b>musket</b> volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a <b>musket</b> ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 1861 was {{relatively}} scarce {{in the early}} years of the Civil War (many troops were still using Model 1842 smoothbored <b>muskets</b> and Model 1816/1822 <b>muskets</b> converted to percussion cap primers, both in [...]69 caliber). It is unlikely that any of these were available for use in the First Battle of Bull Run. However, over time, more and more regiments began receiving Model 1861 rifled <b>muskets,</b> though this upgrade appeared somewhat quicker in the Eastern Theater of Operations. Over 1,000,000 Model 1861 rifles were produced, with the Springfield Armory increasing its production during the war by contracting out to twenty other firms in the Union. The number of Model 1861 <b>muskets</b> produced by the Springfield Armory was 265,129 between January 1, 1861 and December 31, 1863. According to United States <b>Muskets,</b> Rifles and Carbines by Arcadi Gluckman Colonel Infantry, United States Army, published 1949.|$|R
50|$|However, {{soldiers}} {{armed with}} rifled <b>muskets</b> {{were not always}} successful on the battlefield. In the Italian War of 1859, Austrian troops armed with rifled <b>muskets</b> were defeated by French forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.|$|R
50|$|Chickens, ducks, {{goats and}} a horse were brought from Sydney. A garden was soon {{cultivated}}. Food was either cultivated or imported on the infrequent ships from Sydney. Pork and Kumera could be traded from the Māori, however {{in the early}} days <b>muskets</b> were the item of barter which Māori wanted to trade, but Henry Williams refused to trade <b>muskets.</b> The supply of pork and other food was withheld in an attempt to pressure Henry to trade <b>muskets</b> for food.|$|R
5|$|When skirmishing, light {{infantry}} {{fought in}} pairs, {{so that one}} soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets. While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry <b>musket</b> being issued to most troops. The accuracy of the <b>musket</b> decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, {{it is likely that}} skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the accuracy of point-blank range. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used multi-shot and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's <b>musket</b> was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} had shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose <b>musket</b> was trained on the officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was issued}} new Springfield rifle <b>muskets</b> (possibly the Springfield Model 1861) in late November after being issued smoothbore <b>muskets.</b> The men, recruited as sharp shooters, protested and Governor Olden made a special request {{to get the}} best weapon available to men.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 17th century, the matchlock <b>muskets</b> of some line {{infantry}} were equipped with bayonets. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of <b>muskets</b> and were used when line troops entered melee combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.|$|R

5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated <b>musket</b> fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred <b>musket</b> balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate bayonet and <b>musket</b> battle followed. Women and {{children}} fled the fight into the river, where many drowned immediately. The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being peppered with canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of general issue rifled <b>muskets</b> in the American Civil War, and longer {{engagement}} ranges during the later stages of the war, the buck and ball loading began to fade from use.Buck and ball did see action in the remaining inventory of smoothbore <b>muskets</b> at Gettysburg and later actions.The Union Irish Brigade retained their smoothbore <b>muskets</b> until late so they could fire buck and ball during the relatively close range battles, perhaps most famously, and to good effect, against Pickett's Charge.|$|R
50|$|After the U.S. Civil War, many Model 1861/1863 <b>muskets</b> were {{converted}} to breech-loading weapons, creating the Model 1865 rifle. After the change from muzzle-loading to breech-loading, these weapons were no longer referred to as rifled <b>muskets</b> and instead were simply referred to as rifles.|$|R
50|$|Most 1835 <b>muskets</b> had the flintlock {{replaced}} with a percussion lock during the 1840s and 1850s. Some of the 1835 <b>muskets</b> also had their barrels rifled during this same period, if the barrel was deemed to be thick enough to be structurally sound after rifling.|$|R
