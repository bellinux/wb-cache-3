5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Kennedy was {{substantially}} behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination. Historian <b>Michael</b> <b>Beschloss</b> believed, however, that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4% to 42.7%. Nixon won by a more decisive 301-191 margin in the electoral vote.|$|E

However, other writers such as Tom Wicker, who covered the Kennedy campaign for The New York Times, believe that Humphrey's large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states, combined with Senator McCarthy's refusal to quit the race, would have prevented Kennedy from ever winning a majority at the Democratic Convention, and that Humphrey would have been the Democratic nominee even if Kennedy had lived. The journalist Richard Reeves and historian <b>Michael</b> <b>Beschloss</b> have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman Larry O'Brien wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.|$|E

5000|$|Walter Ernst Paul Ulbricht (30 June 18931 August 1973) was a German Communist politician. Ulbricht {{played a}} leading role in the {{creation}} of the Weimar-era Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and later (after spending the years of Nazi rule in exile in France and the Soviet Union) in the early development and establishment of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic). As the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party 1950 to 1971, he was the chief decision maker in East Germany. From President Wilhelm Pieck's death in 1960, he was also the East German head of state until his own death in 1973. He followed Stalin's guidelines very closely, and made sure that everyone else in East Germany did so as well.

5000|$|A poll of 160 historians, {{political}} scientists and urban experts ranked Daley as the sixth best mayor in American history. Daley's ways {{may not have}} been democratic, but his defenders have argued that he achieved positive things for Chicago which a non-boss would have been unable to do. While detractors point out that he did nothing to integrate what had then become known as the most segregated city in the nation, others argue that he was acting on behalf of his constituency, who did not want an integrated Chicago. On the 50th anniversary of Daley's first 1955 swearing-in, several dozen Daley biographers and associates met at the Chicago Historical Society. Historian <b>Michael</b> <b>Beschloss</b> called Daley [...] "the pre-eminent mayor of the 20th century." [...] Chicago journalist Elizabeth Taylor said, [...] "Because of Mayor Daley, Chicago did not become a Detroit or a Cleveland." [...] Many feel that by revitalizing the downtown area and firmly fixing the middle-class in place in the city limits, Daley probably did save Chicago from declining to the extent of the average Rust Belt city. Robert Remini pointed out that while other cities were in fiscal crisis in the 1960s and 1970s, [...] "Chicago always had a double-A bond rating." [...] According to Chicago folksinger Steve Goodman, [...] "no man could inspire more love, more hate."Daley's twenty-one-year tenure as mayor is memorialized in the following: ...|$|E
