40|$|Scaffolding is a {{learning}} approach {{designed to promote}} a deeper understanding, it is the support given during the learning process which is tailored {{to the needs of}} the student with the intention of helping the student achieve the learning goals, including resources, a compelling task, templates and guides, and guidance on the development of cognitive and social skills. Meanwhile, problem-based learning (PBL) situate learning in complex tasks. Such task require scaffolding to help students engage in sense making, managing their investigations, problem-solving processes, and encouraging students to articulate their thinking and reflect on their learning. This study aimed to develop four <b>scaffolding</b> <b>modules</b> for collaborative problem-based learning through the computer network on Moodle LMS for the computer programming course of undergraduate students, and to analyze the satisfaction of the experts and students after using the developed <b>scaffolding</b> <b>modules.</b> The four <b>scaffolding</b> <b>modules</b> consisted of metacognitive scaffolding, conceptual scaffolding, strategic scaffolding, and procedural scaffolding, each of which represented by a 3 -D animation expert cartoon to attract students. The sample group were twenty-two students of small group pilot and six experts. The findings indicated that the degree of satisfaction towards the scaffolding from the experts was high and the degree of the satisfaction towards the scaffolding from the students was also high.

40|$|PDZ domains are <b>scaffolding</b> <b>modules</b> in protein-protein {{interactions}} that mediate numerous physiological functions by interacting canonically with the C-terminus or non-canonically with an internal motif of protein ligands. A conserved carboxylate-binding {{site in the}} PDZ domain facilitates binding via backbone hydrogen bonds; however, {{little is known about}} the role of these hydrogen bonds due to experimental challenges with backbone mutations. Here we address this interaction by generating semisynthetic PDZ domains containing backbone amide-to-ester mutations and evaluating the importance of individual hydrogen bonds for ligand binding. We observe substantial and differential effects upon amide-to-ester mutation in PDZ 2 of postsynaptic density protein 95 and other PDZ domains, suggesting that hydrogen bonding at the carboxylate-binding site contributes to both affinity and selectivity. In particular, the hydrogen-bonding pattern is surprisingly different between the non-canonical and canonical interaction. Our data provide a detailed understanding of the role of hydrogen bonds in protein-protein interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstractβ {{subunits}} of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) regulate channel {{trafficking and}} function, thereby shaping {{the intensity and}} duration of intracellular changes in calcium. β subunits share limited sequence homology with the Src homology 3 -guanylate kinase (SH 3 -GK) module of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). Here, we show biochemical similarities between β subunits and MAGUKs, revealing important aspects of β subunit structure and function. Similar to MAGUKs, an SH 3 -GK interaction within β subunits can occur both intramolecularly and intermolecularly. Mutations that disrupt the SH 3 -GK interaction in β subunits alter channel inactivation and can inhibit binding between the α 1 and β subunits. Coexpression of β subunits with complementary mutations in their SH 3 and GK domains rescues these deficits through intermolecular β subunit assembly. In MAGUKs, the SH 3 -GK <b>module</b> controls protein <b>scaffolding.</b> In β subunits, this module regulates the inactivation of VGCCs and provides an additional mechanism for tuning calcium responsiveness...|$|R

40|$|The University of Northampton {{has taken}} an {{institutional}} approach to learning and teaching through the widespread adoption of Active Blended Learning (ABL) as its new ‘normal’. To find out more please visit: [URL] However, student engagement has been highly variable, which has created a number of challenges for staff. Semi-structured qualitative focus groups have been undertaken with 201 undergraduate students across all the year groups and faculties during the academic year 16 / 17 based on a pilot study of 24 students in academic year 15 / 16. These focus groups {{have been looking at}} trying to uncover the students own perceptions and experiences of ABL in order to unpick the reasons behind varying patterns and engagements and to glean student insight into the factors that inhibit or encourage engagement with ABL. The study has revealed a number of key factors which students identify as having a significant impact on their engagement. Key success factors include effective pedagogical design, in particular establishing a clear and explicit relationship between online and face to face components of <b>modules,</b> and <b>scaffolding</b> the development of digital skills and literacies in the process of establishing online tasks. A strong relationship between staff and students is also critical, where students trust in the decisions and motivations of staff. This is signalled by following up on online tasks, providing feedback where relevant, and explicitly discussing the value of online tasks to module learning outcomes and employability skills. A key finding is that students’ conceptions of learning, teaching & knowledge impact on their engagement with ABL, and are not necessarily compatible with ABL principles. These factors are complex, interdependent and have varying loci of control. Staff can take a number of measures to increase the likelihood of student engagement, although certain factors remain ultimately within the agency of students. Understanding these issues is {{critical to the success of}} ABL...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In Australia, {{the ability}} to {{interpret}} orthopaedic x-rays is an entry-level skill for physiotherapists. Yet there is a paucity of evidence in the literature which details effective learning and teaching methods to optimise confidence and competence in x-ray interpretation. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe the content contained in an orthopaedic radiology module within an Australian 2 -year graduate entry Master of Physiotherapy degree; approaches to learning and teaching used in this module; student satisfaction associated with this module over a 2 -year period. Method: The University’s framework for quality assurance, which is based on the Plan-Implement-Review-Improve underpinned this action research project. The content of the radiology module was reviewed and feedback was gained from a student focus group and standard university course data. Data were analysed using descriptive content analysis and descriptive statistics to identify areas for improvement. Changes to the module were then developed and implemented, and the effect of these changes were evaluated using a custom-designed survey. Results: It was found that didactic methods of teaching were used in this module that encouraged surface level learning. Students reported feeling stressed during the radiology examination due to the learning tasks and assessment being disconnected, and often reported difficulty transferring knowledge into the clinical placement setting. Constructive alignment was undertaken of learning activities and assessment tasks. An additional non-compulsory tutorial was added to the radiology <b>module,</b> where <b>scaffolding</b> and cooperative learning techniques were used to teach students x-ray interpretation. Students reported that the revised curriculum increased their confidence in interpreting x-rays. Students’ competence in x-ray interpretation also increased based on a significant increase in score on their radiology examination. Conclusion: Based on {{the findings of this study}} the addition of a tutorial that focused on interpretation of x-ray films to supplement radiology teaching improved entry-level physiotherapy students’ confidence and competence in interpreting x-rays and their perceived preparedness for clinical placement in a small entry-level physiotherapy cohort at a single Australian University...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of proteins that display complementary activities into macromolecular complexes {{is critical to}} cellular function. One such enzyme complex, of environmental significance, is the plant cell wall degrading apparatus of anaerobic bacteria, termed the cellulosome. The complex assembles through the interaction of enzyme-derived “type I dockerin” modules with the multiple “cohesin” <b>modules</b> of the <b>scaffolding</b> protein. Clostridium thermocellum type I dockerin modules contain a duplicated 22 -residue sequence that comprises helix- 1 and helix- 3, respectively. The crystal structure of a C. thermocellum type I cohesin-dockerin complex showed that cohesin recognition was predominantly through helix- 3 of the dockerin. The sequence duplication is reflected in near-perfect 2 -fold structural symmetry, suggesting that both repeats could interact with cohesins by a common mechanism in wild-type (WT) proteins. Here, a helix- 3 disrupted mutant dockerin is used to visualize the reverse binding in which the dockerin mutant is indeed rotated 180 ° relative to the WT dockerin such that helix- 1 now dominates recognition of its protein partner. The dual binding mode is predicted to impart significant plasticity into {{the orientation of the}} catalytic subunits within this supramolecular assembly, which reflects the challenges presented by the degradation of a heterogeneous, recalcitrant, insoluble substrate by a tethered macromolecular complex...|$|R
40|$|Modular {{proteins}} serve assembly {{platforms and}} often actively regulate cellular signaling events. An intrinsic diversity of interaction <b>modules,</b> typical for <b>scaffolding</b> proteins, facilitates {{the organization of}} numerous protein partners into signaling cascades, contributing to the spatial precision, efficiency and fidelity of signal transduction. The role of complex molecular dynamics of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins in synaptic plasticity is relatively new and yet to be fully understood. AIDA- 1 {{is one of the}} most abundant members of the PSD protein family. Growing research evidence of multiple protein partnerships suggests that AIDA- 1 functions as an essential PSD molecular scaffold, NMDA receptor functional mediator, and a synapse-to-nucleus messenger. The NMR structure of AIDA- 1 carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB), presented in this study, provided the structural basis for comparative analysis with the other PTB domain-containing proteins, Fe 65 and X 11 /Mint 1, that also participate in amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid beta peptide (A) secretion. A combination of peptide arrays, mutagenesis and fluorescence based assays was employed to characterize the affinity and specificity of the AIDA- 1 PTB domain and APP intracellular domain (AICD) interaction. Another modular protein of these studies is a pre-synaptic scaffolding protein, Caskin 2. Presently, its function within the synapse is less clear compared to its more widely studied homolog, Caskin 1. However, the structural differences between the two identified by our research suggest the possibility of distinct functional outcomes in the neuron. We demonstrated that Caskin 2 Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) assembles into an oligomeric architecture different from Caskin 1, with the minimal repeating unit being a dimer, rather than a monomer. In invertebrates, Caskin has been functionally linked to LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase functional pathways, implicated in axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. Using a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods, the partnership between Caskin 2 and LAR Homo sapiens homologs was confirmed and characterized. These integrated structural and functional studies provide a platform for further elucidation of AIDA- 1 and Caskin cellular functions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Scaffold {{proteins}} play central {{roles in}} the function of many signaling pathways. Among the best-studied examples are the Ste 5 and Far 1 proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins contain three conserved modules, the RING and PH domains, characteristic of some ubiquitin-ligating enzymes, and a vWA domain implicated in protein-protein interactions. In yeast, Ste 5 p regulates the mating pathway kinases while Far 1 p coordinates the cellular polarity machinery. Within the fungal lineage, the Basidiomycetes and the Pezizomycetes contain a single Far 1 -like protein, while several Saccharomycotina species, belonging to the CTG (Candida) clade, contain both a classic Far 1 -like protein and a Ste 5 -like protein that lacks the vWA domain. We analyzed the function of C. albicans Ste 5 p (Cst 5 p), {{a member of this}} class of structurally distinct Ste 5 proteins. CST 5 is essential for mating and still coordinates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) cascade elements {{in the absence of the}} vWA domain; Cst 5 p interacts with the MEK kinase (MEKK) C. albicans Ste 11 p (CaSte 11 p) and the MAPK Cek 1 as well as with the MEK Hst 7 in a vWA domain-independent manner. Cst 5 p can homodimerize, similar to Ste 5 p, but can also heterodimerize with Far 1 p, potentially forming heteromeric signaling scaffolds. We found direct binding between the MEKK CaSte 11 p and the MEK Hst 7 p that depends on a mobile acidic loop absent from S. cerevisiae Ste 11 p but related to the Ste 7 binding region within the vWA domain of Ste 5 p.

40|$|Leishmaniasis is a {{group of}} vector-borne {{diseases}} caused by obligate intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. In both dogs and humans Leishmania infantum infection is more prevalent than disease, as infection often does not equate with clinical disease. In order to differentiate infection vs. progressive disease for better disease prognostication, we temporally evaluated humoral and cellular immunologic parameters of naturally infected dogs. The work presented here describes {{for the first time the}} temporal immune response to natural autochthonous L. infantum infection in Foxhounds within the United States. Several key changes in immunological parameters should be considered to differentiate infection versus clinical disease, including a dramatic rise in IgG production, loss of antigen-specific PBMC proliferation, and IFN-gamma production, concomitant IL- 10 production and consistent detection of parasite kinetoplast DNA in whole blood. This clinical presentation and immuno-dysregulation mirrors that observed in human patients indicating that this animal model will be very useful for testing immunomodulatory anti-IL- 10 or other therapies. The murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis using L. amazonensis infection provides an excellent model to study host-Leishmania interactions that may lead to a non-productive immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells, critical for induction and regulation of T cell immune responses against pathogens. Initiation of productive immune responses against Leishmania depends on the successful transition of DC from an immature to a mature phenotype, characterized by high CD 40 surface expression and IL- 12 production. This productive immune response is frequently seen in response to L. major infection. Characterization of draining lymph node CD 11 c+ DC from L. amazonensis or L. major promastigote-infected mice revealed that by 7 days post-infection, CD 11 c+ cells from the draining lymph node of L. amazonensis promastigote-infected mice have significantly reduced CD 40 surface expression, and there was a significant decrease in the number of IL- 12 p 40 -producing cells. Analysis of MAP kinase signaling revealed that infection of DC in vitro with L. amazonensis resulted in increased ERK phosphorylation. Inhibition of ERK in vitro or in vivo led to enhanced DC surface CD 40 expression and in vitro increased IL- 12 p 40 production. Peak ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation was observed 4 hours post-infection in vitro, when parasites are primarily present within intracellular phagolysosome-based parasitophorous vacuoles. Intracellular activation of ERK 1 / 2 from phagolysosomes requires the recruitment and association of ERK 1 / 2 -specific scaffolding proteins, including p 14 /MP 1 and MORG 1, on the surface of this intracellular compartment. Here we identify <b>scaffolding</b> <b>module</b> co-localization, specifically the endosomal ERK-related proteins MP 1 and MORG 1 with L. amazonensis-containing, LAMP 2 positive-phagolysosomes in DC.

IMPORTANCE The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is an extensively used signaling module in eukaryotic cells, and the ability to regulate these modules is critical for ensuring proper responses to a wide variety of stimuli. One way that cells regulate this signaling module is through scaffold proteins that insulate related pathways against cross talk, improve signaling efficiency, and ensure that signals are connected to the correct response. The Ste 5 scaffold of the S. cerevisiae mating response is a well-studied representative of this class of proteins. Using bioinformatics, structural modeling, and molecular genetic approaches, we have investigated the equivalent scaffold in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. We show that the C. albicans protein is structurally distinct from that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae but still provides similar functions. Increases in pathway complexity have been associated with changes in scaffold connectivity, and overall, the tethering capacity of the scaffolds has been more conserved than their structural organization.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{problem for}} computational genomics {{is the problem}} of de novo genome assembly: the development of robust scalable methods for transforming short randomly sampled “shotgun” sequences, namely reads, into the contiguous and accurate reconstruction of complex genomes. These reads are significantly shorter (e. g. hundreds of bases long) than the size of chromosomes and also include errors. While advanced methods exist for assembling the small and haploid genomes of prokaryotes, the genomes of eukaryotes are more complex. Moreover, de novo assembly has been unable {{to keep pace with the}} flood of data, due to the dramatic increases in genome sequencer capabilities, combined with the computational requirements and the algorithmic complexity of assembling large scale genomes and metagenomes. In this dissertation, we address this challenge head on by developing parallel algorithms for de novo genome assembly with the ambition to scale to massive concurrencies. Our work is based on the Meraculous assembler, a state-of-the-art de novo assembler for short reads developed at JGI. Meraculous identifies non-erroneous overlapping substrings of length k (k-mers) with high quality extensions and uniquely assembles genome regions into uncontested sequences called contigs by constructing and traversing a de Bruijn graph of k-mers, a special graph that is used to represent overlaps among k-mers. The original reads are subsequently aligned onto the contigs to obtain information regarding the relative orientation of the contigs. Contigs are then linked together to create scaffolds, sequences of contigs that may contain gaps among them. Finally gaps are filled using localized assemblies based on the original reads. First, we design efficient scalable algorithms for k-mer analysis and contig generation. K-mer analysis is characterized by intensive communication and I/O requirements and our parallel algorithms successfully reduce the memory requirements by 7 ×. Then, contig generation relies on efficient parallelization of the de Bruijn graph construction and traversal, which necessitates a distributed hash table and is a key component of most de novo assemblers. We present a novel algorithm that leverages one-sided communication capabilities of the UPC to facilitate the requisite fine-grained, irregular parallelism and the avoidance of data hazards. The sequence alignment is characterized by intensive I/O and large computation requirements. We introduce mer-Aligner, a highly parallel sequence aligner that employs parallelism in all of its components. Finally, this thesis details the parallelization of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>modules,</b> enabling the first massively scalable, high quality, complete end-to-end de novo assembly pipeline. Experimental large-scale results using human and wheat genomes demonstrate efficient performance and scalability on thousands of cores. Compared to the original Meraculous code, which requires approximately 48 hours to assemble the human genome, our pipeline called HipMer computes the assembly in only 4 minutes using 23, 040 cores of Edison – an overall speedup of approximately 720 ×. In the last part of the dissertation we tackle the problem of metagenome assembly. Metagenomics is currently the leading technology to study the uncultured microbial diversity. While accessing an unprecedented number of environmental samples that consist of thousands of individual microbial genomes is now possible, the bottleneck is becoming computational, since the sequencing cost improvements exceed that of Moore’s Law. Metagenome assembly is further complicated by repeated sequences across genomes, polymorphisms within a species and variable frequency of the genomes within the sample. In our work we repurpose HipMer components for the problem of metagenome assembly and we design a versatile, high-performance metagenome assembly pipeline that outperforms state-of-the-art tools in both quality and performance...|$|R
