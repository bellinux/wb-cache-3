Case studies show that in <b>multi-shaft</b> reduction drive, the ratio of the drive system rotary inertia on the SRI of the motor shaft is from 5. 377 % to 18. 567 %. Therefore, weight reduction of the drive system has obvious effect on lessening the energy consumption and cycle of the motor’s startup or brake.

40|$|Comminution is {{well known}} to be an inefficient process and a large {{consumer}} of energy globally, giving rise {{to the development of}} novel comminution devices trying to exploit this opportunity. A <b>multi-shaft</b> mill, considered to be a novel comminution device, combines a series of rotating shafts with attached flingers which impact gravity fed material. The mill offers positive benefits in terms of plant footprint, high reduction ratio, high throughput and potential benefits through ore specific circuit integration. A process performance evaluation was conducted by surveying the mill along with using Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling. The survey proved the mills ability to continuously sustain operation and product size for two different ore types under various configurations. The DEM predicted that gravity fed material entering the <b>multi-shaft</b> mill, with 50 % of particles accelerated to a velocity higher than 184 km/h and 10 % higher than 299 km/h. These velocities are converted to comminution energy through collisions with liners or particle-particle interactions. Each particle is subject to more than 24 impacts per second, greater than the critical breakage strength of a particle (0. 01 kW h/t), leading to potential efficient comminution. Significant numbers of collisions were simulated in the mill alongside significant breakage being recorded through the surveying of the mill, leading to a reasonable comparison of product size distributions from the simulated adsorbed collision energies compared to the survey data. Using this baseline of the mills performance evaluation methodology further simulation work will aim to better quantify the breakage environment through a full-scale simulation run in parallel with future proposed survey work which will address wear rates and tailored operating conditions for specific ore types...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The pre- and inter-cooled recuperative closed Brayton cycle can be {{configured}} to {{be either}} a single or a <b>multi-shaft</b> arrangement. In comparison to the single shaft, <b>multi-shaft</b> arrangements have not been used widely in the closed cycle environment. Therefore, during {{the development of a}} three-shaft Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), a Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) was constructed to illustrate the envisaged PBMR control methodologies. The PBMM now offers the opportunity to investigate other shaft arrangements. The main objective {{of this study is to}} perform a conceptual layout design for a two-shaft PBMM configuration. The major steps performed in the conceptual layout design of the two-shaft PBMM are preliminary studies, thermodynamic design point studies and turbo machine selection. During the thermodynamic design point studies the influence of turbocharger selection on the cycle performance were investigated. Two optimum-values for Overall Pressure Ratio (OPR) were found, one for maximum cycle efficiency and one for maximum cycle power output. This, together with the requirement for the OPR to be equally shared between the Low- Pressure Compressor (LPC) and the High-pressure Compressor (HPC), was used to identify suitable turbocharger pairs. In order to evaluate the compressor operating points of the turbochargers, the unique matching characteristics for the pre- and inter-cooled recuperative closed Brayton cycle were derived. Final turbocharger selection was performed in Flownex. The turbocharger pair that enjoyed the highest cycle efficiency at thermodynamic conditions similar to that of the three-shaft PBMM configuration was suggested as the preferred turbocharger configuration. Unexpectedly the turbochargers selected for the two-shaft configuration were found to be identical to that of the three-shaft PBMM configuration. This led to a comparison of matching characteristics of the two-shaft configuration to that of the three-shaft configuration. The close proximity of both configurations to the choking region of the LPT ensured the close proximity of their operating points on the HPT. The fact that the HPC operating point is only a function of the HPT operating point caused close proximity of the HPC operating points. The requirement for flow compatibility that must exist between the NPC and LPC limited the operating point of the LPC for both configurations to the same flow compatibility line, which ensured the close proximity of the LPC operating points.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The rapid {{development}} in nuclear technology worldwide {{has created the}} need for an efficient power conversion unit to extract the energy from the new generation IV reactors. The generation IV reactor currently under investigation in South Africa is the PBMR–DPP (Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Demonstration Power Plant) based on the High temperature Reactor Modul. This reactor produces 200 MW of thermal energy at inlet/outlet temperatures of 250 oC/ 700 oC. Due to the reactor layout and accompanying thermal fluid path design outlet temperatures in the order of 900 oC would be possible. This dissertation is aimed at the design and optimisation of a Brayton–Rankine combined cycle for use with a PBMR–DPP. The combination of these two cycles improves the thermal efficiency due to the large difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures. The Brayton and Rankine cycles will be developed independently and optimised to ensure that the best possible efficiency is gained from the combined cycle. The heat energy available in the reactor is the input parameter for the Brayton cycle, After the Brayton cycle's pressure ratio has been optimised the heat rejected to the Rankine cycle will be known. The aim of the design is to determine if 50 % combined cycle thermal efficiency is achievable. The initial sizing calculation of the cycle parameters has been done in a software package that has been developed for use in the thermo–hydraulics field. Engineering Equation Solver (EES) makes use of an iterative process to simultaneously solve the set of equations. The results obtained from EES were verified by Microsoft Excel with a specialised macro installed for thermo–hydraulics. A very specific methodology was used to solve the Brayton cycle. Traditionally the Brayton cycle is optimised for maximum cycle efficiency to ultimately obtain the best combined cycle efficiency. Very complex cycles such as reheat and <b>multi–shaft</b> Brayton cycles were used. The solution methodology used in this dissertation is to optimise the simple Brayton cycle for the maximum specific work produced in the cycle. The large amount of heat at the turbine outlet is then transferred to the Rankine cycle. The results obtained from the calculations preformed were that a combined cycle efficiency of 52. 914 % has been achieved at optimum operating conditions. The combined cycle has been shown to operate above 50 % efficiency {{in a wide variety of}} load–following conditions. Master...|$|E
40|$|The exergetic {{investigation}} of a simple cycle gas turbine process shows that the main losses are found within the exhaust gas and the combustion chamber. Additionally, a big amount of the generated shaft power is necessary to drive the compressor. At these three positions the different design optimization possibilities intercooling, recuperation and the Inverse Brayton Cycle are located that are investigated firstly separately and afterwards combined with each other within this thesis. The idea of the Inverse Brayton Cycle is taken over from the steam process. The expansion of steam within the steam turbine down to a sub-pressure of e. g. 45 mbar is state of the art. After the subsequent condensation the water is pumped back into the feed water tank. Analogously, a hot exhaust gas (coming from a gas turbine for example) is expanded down to a pressure level far below atmosphere. After a heat extraction the gas is compressed on ambient pressure to release it to the environment. Since some simulation parameters of the considered processes can be chosen freely, as the pressure level of the intercooling for example, from the thermodynamical view a design point can be chosen for a given combination of pressure ratio and combustion chamber temperature, so that an optimum efficiency or a maximum power is achieved. The maximum specific power of all investigated optimization possibilities is Pmax= 984 kWel/kgAir, the best efficiency is 56. 9 %. For the estimation, if the considered variations have a commercial application generally, the net present value is calculated for these processes. By this simple approach a forecast is given, if the energetic advantages of the Inverse Brayton Cycle (IBC) make sense {{with regard to the}} economy. Here, process variations with a positive net present value can be identified. Due to the high potential of the Inverse Brayton Cycle (IBC) it is attempted to combine the IBC with further processes. A comparison with a steam cycle for the usage of exhaust heat (coming from a chemical process for example) shows the disadvantages of an IBC. Nevertheless, the adaptation of an IBC to a steam injected gas turbine or the possible extension of a compressed air storage power plant with an IBC is positive. Since the importance of the partload behaviour of power plants is increasing, in addition a simple cycle gas turbine process is compared with a gas turbine combined with an IBC. Here, the efficiency and the stable operation range of a one-shaft and a <b>multi-shaft</b> gas turbine are considered. Additionally, the potential of different control possibilities is investigated. With the used maps and part loads correlations an increase in efficiency is possible by the combination with an IBC. This positive effect is opposed to a reduction of the stable operation range...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Eskom, {{the sole}} {{supplier}} of electricity in South Africa is facing an energy crisis. This {{is due to}} the steady increase in demand for electricity in South Africa. Low electricity prices in South Africa have helped the energy intensive industries of South Africa to be more competitive. Unfortunately this has resulted in poor energy efficiency practices and has hampered incentives to save energy. To address this problem, Eskom initiated a Demand Side Management (DSM) programme. DSM is beneficial to both Eskom and the client. However, due to the high cost of implementing such projects, it is feasible to implement it only on sites where the load shift potential is high enough for Eskom to benefit. The mining industry has been targeted for DSM programmes. This {{is due to the}} existence of a large mining sector in South Africa and to its energy intensive nature. Most mining operations require large amounts of water which is used to cool the underground environment and so ensure productivity and the safety of the workers. Due to the large amounts of water needed for mining, the electricity usage of these pumping systems is very high. If the use of this electricity can be optimised by implementing DSM principles, this will result in the long term savings of costs for the mines involved. The majority of pumping systems found on mines are single shaft systems. Individually these systems have a very high DSM potential. However, if multiple shaft systems can be used for DSM, the benefits will be far greater. Furthermore, combining several sites with an interconnected water pumping system will increase the potential for DSM and enable sites where individually the potential is too low to be feasible for a DSM project to raise their potential. This will result in more sites where DSM projects can be implemented and more clients who can benefit from the DSM programme. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate and implement a DSM project on an intricate <b>multi-shaft</b> mine pumping system which will be controlled from a single point. The project required a detailed investigation of the pumping systems on each shaft and how the water system is interlinked between the shafts. This project was carried out on Beatrix Mine Shafts 1, 2 and 3. The pumping systems were analysed and simulated according to the specific constraints and requirements that were specified by the mine. During the investigation and implementation of this project, possible efficiency improvements on certain pump stations were discovered and implemented. The improvements enabled both an increase in water flow to the surface and a decrease in power consumption. Due to this load reduction, the savings achieved were higher than those found in most load shifting projects. Moreover, additional infrastructures were installed to ensure communication between pumping systems. Once the simulation and optimisation of the control system was completed, the pumping system network was automated. The load shift resulted in a ± 3. 5 MW shift in the morning peak demand period and a ± 6. 0 MW shift in the evening peak demand period. This load shift has resulted in an average cost saving of R 80 000 per month during summer tariff period, and R 300 000 per month during winter tariff period. This saving result was calculated by taking load reduction into account. This project has shown that a DSM project can be implemented successfully, given the necessary historical data and expertise, on a pumping system that is interconnected between multiple shafts.

40|$|Compressing {{equipment}} can {{be found}} in almost every area of our industrialized society. Compressors drive our fridges, air conditioning systems and enable turbine engines to propel the aircrafts we use when going for holidays or a business trip. Without compressors an operation of virtually any conventional power plant providing electricity to our houses would not be possible. The compressor technology can therefore be regarded as a mature area of engineering with a vast theoretical and operational experience. It may happen however that a traditional approach to certain new problems will not suffice, and alternative ways must be searched for. Such open-mindedness was required when the idea of introducing an oil-free compressor for a CO 2 commercial refrigeration system was born. Initially, hermetic radial turbomachinery was identified as a potential candidate for this task. However, it turned out that rather special properties of carbon dioxide, compared to other common refrigerants, will result in challenges uncommon in turbomachinery found in other applications. While the initial technology choice still seemed feasible, high density of the CO 2 at relevant operating conditions and significant rotational speeds required for a relatively small machine were indicating excessive levels of windage losses generated by the spinning rotor of the compressor. It was decided to build a 1 D tool for prediction of efficiencies {{for a wide range of}} machines based on a radial turbocompressor principle, but designed for CO 2 applications with different operating pressures and capacities. The predictions of the tool were compared against numerical and experimental data. Good match was found. The 1 D study revealed that high compression efficiencies, exceeding 70 %, are possible for the oil-free radial compressor concept in a relatively wide range of capacities provided that the inlet pressure is low, around 1 MPa, and that the pressure ratio is moderate, below 3. Potential for good efficiency is expected to deteriorate rapidly with increasing operational pressures due to windage losses. There is no obvious strategy for improvement of overall compressor efficiency when smaller capacities and close to supercritical pressures are in the focus. The major fraction of undesirable rotational losses is generated by the electrical motor. It can be reduced either by installing longer more slender motor or by reduction of rotational speeds. Efficiency improvement reached with application of a longer motor is shown to be of limited impact and is expected to be challenging from the rotordynamics point of view. Alternatively, multi-stage <b>multi-shaft</b> machine can be designed, but economic viability of such a strategy remains questionable. Reduction of the compressor speed is not straightforward either, especially at low volumetric flows when low speeds would be detrimental to the impeller and diffuser efficiency. A non-standard approach introducing partially admitted radial machine was therefore proposed. A numerical analysis of a partially admitted compressor stage with a 16 cm impeller rotating at 13000 rpm is carried out. Transient 2 D simulations indicate more than 80 % efficiency of the wheel at the total pressure ratio of around 1. 4. To estimate the final stage efficiency, 3 D effects such as the end-wall losses, the radial leakage, and the diffuser performance must be taken into account. A transient 3 D analysis of the complete stage of the novel compressor has not been completed due to its time consuming nature. 3 D simulations performed for various diffuser configurations indicate however that around 75 % overall stage efficiencies might be possible. It would require further optimization of both blade and diffuser shapes. Comparison of non-stage losses, for both centrifugal and partial admission concepts, allow presuming that the novel machine could be superior in terms of the overall performance provided that comparable systems are characterized by close to supercritical mean operating pressures and capacities typical for commercial scale applications. To verify the initial insights of the present work, further research, including laboratory testing, is needed. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E
