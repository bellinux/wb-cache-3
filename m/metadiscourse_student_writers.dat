40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{acknowledges the}} fact that research regarding deaf <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> at the post-secondary level is practically void. To initiate an avenue of research that is meant to foreground future research regarding support services for deaf college <b>student</b> <b>writers,</b> I {{set out to find}} how college institutions are serving deaf <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> through academic support services by designing three institutional case studies. The first goal of this project was to synthesize research on the topic of deaf college <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> by organizing existing literature relevant to deaf education and language acquisition. The second goal of this project was to generate descriptive portraits of three institutions by illustrating how the schools are serving deaf <b>student</b> <b>writers.</b> The synthesis of the literature, descriptive portraits of the institutions, and discussion of emergent themes revealed from my study will speak to how the fields of Deaf Studies, Disability Studies, and Rhetoric and Composition might proceed {{in order to make the}} most of support services for deaf <b>student</b> <b>writers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Composition {{theory has}} {{in the past two decades}} been {{informed}} by three pedagogical movements. The older process pedagogy foregrounds the <b>student</b> <b>writer</b> in the act of composing. In the past decade, reader response theory has spoken to classroom practice in the forms of collaborative learning and writing across the curriculum pedagogics. In both of these pedagogics, the <b>student</b> <b>writer</b> is perceived as an initiate in a specialized community of writers, and her goal is to master the reading and writing conventions that shape the knowledge in that chosen field. Finally, in the pedagogics of E. D. Hirsch and Allan Bloom, there is a focus on determining valid textual meaning: for these theorists, <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> need to learn their culture before they can engage in any meaningful reading and writing.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} metadiscourse in the persuasive essays of fourth graders from both {{urban and rural}} communities: 224 students in South Korea and 188 in the US. Each student was asked to write a persuasive essay {{in his or her}} native Korean or English in response to a story not previously read or discussed. Analysis with a taxonomy developed by Hyland (2004) indicated significant differences in the metadiscourse by country. In terms of interactive <b>metadiscourse,</b> South Korean <b>students</b> used more sentence-level transitions than U. S. students, who used more frame markers and endophoric markers. With regard to interactional <b>metadiscourse,</b> U. S. <b>students</b> used more hedges, boosters, engagement markers, and self-mentions in their essays. This study also compared the students′ essays by the type of community in which the writers lived. In the US the essays of students in rural communities contained more hedges, whereas those of students in urban areas included significantly more self-mentions. In South Korea, no significant difference was detected in the <b>metadiscourse</b> of <b>students</b> living in rural and urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Constructing {{literature}} review {{is an integral}} part of writing a proposal or research report. In order to conjure up {{literature review}}, <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> need to conduct readings on pertinent previous studies and situate their study among the previous studies. This paper aims at exploring the etutors' or content instructors' pedagogical practices in tutoring the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> on improving their literature review via Google Docs. Google Docs was selected as the platform for the tutoring to take place because it allows both synchronous as well as asynchronous modes of networking. The participants involved are four pairs of e-tutor-student where one-on-one tutoring was conducted. The data collection instruments include the student writers' writing drafts, virtual observation, as well as interview with both the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> and e-tutors. In analyzing the data, qualitative analysis was performed. Analysis of the data suggests that the e-tutors' pedagogical practices include frequent use of direct feedback, pointing out the strengths of the <b>student</b> <b>writers,</b> and asking for the expansion on certain subject matter. The findings are discussed in terms of etutors' concern and the issues pertaining to error correction and praises...|$|R

40|$|A {{disconnect}} frequently {{exists between}} the expectations of <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> and the services offered within the IPFW Writing Center.

In our presentation, we will define and illustrate the differences between directive and non-directive consulting and discuss {{the complexities of the}} debate. Drawing on the work of Brooks, Shamoon and Burnes, Trimbur, and others, we will show the benefits of writing consultations that employ a non-directive approach while meeting the writers’ real need to learn during the consultation.

40|$|Integrating {{source texts}} {{appropriately}} and effectively {{from various sources}} into ones own writing poses significant challenges for <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> as it demands sophisticated advanced academic skills. Beginning writers could benefit from studying strategies employed by more established writers from the same field. This paper reports {{the results of an}} investigation of source use strategies employed in 6 published research articles and 6 unpublished masters student papers from the field of chemical engineering. Different source use strategies were categorized as paraphrase, summary, generalization and exact copying. The findings demonstrated that while in research articles, summaries and generalizations were frequently employed, in students papers, paraphrases were used the most. The results also showed that the frequency of extensive citations was much higher in students papers and in many instances the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> were too dependent on the source texts. Interviews with the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> revealed gaps in their knowledge of acceptable source use while the expert informants credited their competence to practice, experience, and knowledge of the field...|$|R

40|$|Research {{studies have}} {{investigated}} {{issues in the}} teaching of writing, particularly at the elementary and university levels. Studies of out-of-school writing done by adolescents have focused on digital contexts and social media. This study examines the intersections of the out-of-school and in-school writing worlds of three high school writers: a poet, a novelist, and a contest essay writer. I use data gathered over seven years from the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> and four of their English language arts teachers. Research questions focused on how notions of <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> and the teaching of high school English might be informed by the ways <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> described their out-of-class writing and motivation for writing, how their teachers developed and implemented their philosophies and practices in teaching writing, and how the <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> developed their internally persuasive discourses about writing. In analyzing case study data to answer these questions, I used constant comparison analysis and narrative inquiry analysis, drawing upon theories of heteroglossic discourses, figured worlds, and writing identity. My findings show that in the intersections of out-of-school and in-school writing experiences, students select some writing practices and discourses from their teachers to adopt or adapt, such as developing writing processes, participating in writing communities, and caring about writing. They complicate their definitions of writing, however, as they create figured worlds of writing in which they explore identity, navigate and negotiate complex emotions, and receive recognition. The students illustrate their dialogism with writing discourses in stories of improvisation in which they find power and enact resistance. I argue that writing teachers need encouragement, education, and agency to entertain more complex perceptions of <b>student</b> <b>writers</b> and teaching writing to support students for future personal, academic, career, and public discourse worlds...|$|R
