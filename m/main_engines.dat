5|$|Preparation of Atlantis {{itself for}} mission STS-74 {{began with the}} {{replacement}} of three thrusters in Atlantiss right-hand Orbital Maneuvering System pod in bay 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility on 25 August 1995. Installation of the three Space Shuttle <b>Main</b> <b>Engines</b> (SSMEs) on Atlantis was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the <b>main</b> <b>engines,</b> and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> could be relit.|$|E

40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring and controlling <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine, a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine, getting know how the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine work, making simulation of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine. Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement. Result of simulation fulfills the requirement, the difference values between machine simulation using software instrument and test record of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and auxiliary engine are around 1 %- 2 %. If engine room monitoring control system by wireless and powerline communication is applied in the ship, the ship owner will get advantages because it will prolong ship durability and can monitor operasional of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> or Auxiliary engine from long distance; while the operator will be easier in operating the ship. The disadvantage is only the higher cos...|$|R
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Buran had no main engines; {{take off}} and ascent {{trajectory}} were accomplished with the Energia rocket whose four <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> were expendable. The three Space Shuttle <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> {{were part of the}} orbiter, and were reused for multiple flights.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{research}} the matching of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and turbocharger on sail-assisted ship, a 76000 deadweight tonnage cargo ship with 5 S 60 MC <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and TCA 66 turbocharger was selected. The simulation model of working {{process of the}} engine was established, with AVL BOOST software, and verified by bench test results. Then, the model was {{used to analyze the}} matching of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and turbocharger, at constant speed mode of the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and constant speed mode of the ship. The results show that, the matching of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and turbocharger is acceptable, on the selected sail-assisted ship. However, special attentions should be paid to the turbocharger when the engine load is above 85. 6 % of the rated power at constant speed mode of the ship, to avoid surge of the compressor...|$|R

25|$|In early December 2010, ground {{technicians}} {{installed the}} <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> on Atlantis. The Shuttle received the center engine on 7 December 2010, {{followed by the}} lower-right engine and the lower-left on 8 and 9 December 2010 respectively inside Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF-1). The event marked the last set of <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> ever to be installed on a space shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The W95 has {{a maximum}} {{cruising}} speed of 28 knots, powered by two 1800 horsepower <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> that consume up to 625 litres of fuel per hour.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> are {{connected}} to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear manufactured in Finland by Valmet Rautpohja Works in co-operation with Renk AG. The gearbox is equipped with separate Renk multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings for the <b>main</b> <b>engines.</b> The hydrodynamic couplings that allow over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} are used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The gearbox itself is also designed to withstand the high thrust and torque loads caused by an open propeller operating in ice — the gear teeth are dimensioned to withstand loads up to five times the nominal value. The fully locking mechanical clutches are used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship is operating in open water or light ice conditions.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} description of recommended low pressure auxiliary propulsion subsystems (APS) for a space shuttle orbiter and booster is presented. The APS designs {{are the product of}} a study to identify and evaluate APS concepts, and to perform in-depth design and performance analyses for the most attractive of these. Selected APS baselines use the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> propellant tanks as low pressure gas accumulators. For the orbiter, propellants from separate liquid tanks are used for <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> tank resupply. Resupply propellants are first circulated through tubular, passive heat exchangers, where they are vaporized and superheated prior to injection into the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> tanks. Warm propellant vapors from the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> tanks are mixed with additional liquid propellants in a downstream liquid/vapor mixer and supplied to the engines at constant temperature and pressure (constant density). The booster APS requires no separate propellant storage, since propellant residuals, trapped in the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> tanks following boost, are sufficient to meet APS propellant demands...|$|R

25|$|The foundering of Herakles-Bulk was {{a result}} of loss of {{steering}} ability which was caused by malfunctions in the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> due to severe weather conditions.

25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> primary filters and <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn the ship design process, delivering optimum performance while reducing development and construction costs are key considerations. A {{great amount of}} optimization effort should be done before progressing on a project. When {{it comes to the}} <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> selection phase that corresponds {{to the heart of the}} ship, the ultimate choice will affect the overall platform. However, the problem of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> selection is, as is the overall ship design problem in general, basically a multidisciplinary and multicriterion optimization problem. In this project, we will focus on the multicriterion decision- making methodology for a surface combatant <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> selection problem. This study will consist of a collection of systematic approaches to the overall design optimization. The factors that need to be taken into consideration while selecting a <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> for a surface combatant will be discussed. We propose to develop and examine a mathematical model to analyze the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> selection problem. The mathematical model will be comprehensively formulated, including both quantitative criteria as well as fuzzy systems, to establish an algorithm that will be able to create a unique solution or a set of Pareto solutions to the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> selection problem.
