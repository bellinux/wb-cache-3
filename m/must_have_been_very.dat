5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others {{probably}} all became extinct {{due to a}} combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the {{personal}} names of people of the time nor {{in the names of}} funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{suggest that}} the Allies may have misinterpreted the Persian {{movements}} {{and come to the}} mistaken conclusion that the Persians were sailing east around Skiathos, aiming to sail around the eastern side of Euboea. The signals sent by fire beacons <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> simplistic, and potentially interpreted wrongly; alternatively, the signallers may have genuinely believed that the Persian fleet was sailing to the east of Skiathos. If the Persians sailed around the outer, eastern side of Euboea, they could head straight to Attica, and thereby cut off the Allied fleet's line of retreat. Furthermore, the Persians had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of Artemisium, and sail around Euboea. The withdrawal to Chalcis therefore gave the Allies the opportunity to escape from the Straits of Euboea if the Persians did travel around the outside of Euboea, but also allowed them to return to Artemisium if necessary. In this context, the watchers left on Euboea could inform the Allies if the Persian fleet did indeed sail east of Euboea. The Allied fleet thus continued to wait at Chalcis. Nevertheless, the Allies, undoubtedly anxious about facing a Persian fleet that so greatly outnumbered them, may have somewhat overreacted.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of temple altars and corpulent human representations {{suggests that some}} type of cult existed on the islands of Malta and Gozo in prehistory.

Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships. Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, even possibly conjoined twins.

25|$|The cloister was {{a garden}} courtyard, {{surrounded}} by the domestic buildings of the abbey, mostly constructed in the late 12th century. The eastern buildings, adjoining the transept, are well-preserved, {{and it is possible}} to walk through the slype that gave access to the parlour, chapter house and possibly the infirmary. The south range is ruinous but the walls mainly survive. It contained the refectory, which was divided in the 14th century to provide a warming room. The range was much more complete in the early 19th century, when it still had most of its upper floor. This probably contained the abbot's lodging.

25|$|Roman glass objects {{have been}} {{recovered}} across the Roman Empire in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts. Glass was used primarily {{for the production of}} vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured cast glass vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colourless or ‘aqua’ glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, {{and by the end of}} the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> expensive.|$|E

500|$|The battle left Penda with {{a degree}} of power {{unprecedented}} for a Mercian king—Kirby called him [...] "without question the most powerful Mercian ruler so far to have emerged in the midlands" [...] after Maserfield—and the prestige and status associated with defeating the powerful Oswald <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> significant. Northumbria was greatly weakened {{as a consequence of the}} battle; the kingdom became fractured to some degree between Deira in its southern part and Bernicia in the north, with the Deirans acquiring a king of their own, Oswine, while in Bernicia, Oswald was succeeded by his brother, Oswiu. Mercia thus enjoyed a greatly enhanced position of strength relative to the surrounding kingdoms. Stenton wrote that the battle left Penda as [...] "the most formidable king in England", and observed that although [...] "there is no evidence that he ever became, or even tried to become, the lord of all the other kings of southern England ... none of them can have been his equal in reputation".|$|E

2500|$|... "Afghan regular units...were ill-trained, ill-paid, and {{probably}} under strength. The cavalry was {{little better than}} indifferent infantry mounted on equally indifferent ponies. Rifles varied between modern German, Turkish and British types, to obsolete Martinis and Snyders. Few infantry units had bayonets. Artillery was ponydrawn, or pack, and included modern 10cm Krupp howitzers, 75mm Krupp mountain guns and ancient 7 pounder weapons. There were a few, very old, four-barrel Gardiner machine guns. Ammunition was in short supply and distribution <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> difficult.

2500|$|The Premonstratensians placed great {{emphasis}} on scholarship and the canons of Titchfield possessed {{a very impressive}} library, the catalogue for which survives. [...] There were 224 volumes, each containing {{a number of different}} works bound together, as was common in the period, and some <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> large to contain all the works recorded for them. The books were systematically organised by subject, shelf and location in the library room (probably the chamber between the chapter house and the church as this was the traditional location). There were books in Latin, English [...] and French covering theology, church history, writings of the Fathers of the Church, medicine, law, philosophy, grammar, travel, legends, romances and records of the abbey. The canons also had another collection of more than 100 books used for services that they kept in the church. A library on this scale was huge for the period and is surprising for a minor house like Titchfield. It compares closely, for instance, with the holdings of the great royal foundation of Reading Abbey which had 228 volumes.|$|E

2500|$|The cards have typical {{suits for}} Northern European cards of the period: flowers, birds, deer, beasts of prey and wild men - so five suits in total. Each symbol (or [...] "pip") on a card is different, so the {{quantity}} and difficulty of the engraving is far greater than found in a modern set of cards (and, equally, rapid play <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> difficult as there are no numbers depicted on the cards). Engraved sets of cards are few; {{they must have been}} much more expensive than those made in woodcut, which can be printed in much greater numbers before the matrix wears out. Interestingly and unusually, some of the cards are composed of different little plates, one per pip, which were presumably held together in a frame for printing. [...] Possibly the Master was in Mainz and was influenced by Johannes Gutenberg's movable type. Despite this, the majority of the pips are unique, and although they appear rather jumbled as groups, when looked at individually it is apparent that many are very fine studies of their subjects. Despite the very few impressions surviving, some cards exist in two states, and some in different versions, all catalogued by Max Lehrs.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{challenging}} campaign, {{the details of}} which are obscure, John II managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or Chramon, located in modern Nova Palanka, on the Hungarian bank of the Danube. The Hungarian army, under a commander named Setephel as King Stephen was ill, had entrenched itself, defending {{the line of the}} Danube. The Byzantine historian John Cinnamus describes John II employing a ruse to allow his army to cross the river. He sent a mercenary force composed of [...] "Ligurian knights" [...] (Lombards) and Turks (probably horse archers) to threaten a crossing upstream, while he stayed on the shore opposite Haram {{with the rest of his}} army. The ruse worked as his army crossed the river at Haram by boat, the emperor himself on board the imperial trireme. An opposed river crossing is one of the most demanding of military operations. The Byzantine army <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> disciplined and well supported by archers and bolt-firing artillery on the imperial ships. Once on the Hungarian bank of the Danube the Byzantine cavalry then, [...] "with couched lances, scattered the assembled Hungarian forces." [...] Many Hungarian troops were killed when a bridge they were crossing collapsed as they were fleeing from the Byzantine attack. The Byzantines took Haram, and other Hungarian fortified settlements in the area, and collected a great deal of plunder. The action has been described as a [...] "bloody battle" [...] and a great defeat for the Hungarians.|$|E
2500|$|While plesiosaurs varied {{little in}} the build of the trunk, and can be called [...] "conservative" [...] in this respect, there were major {{differences}} between the subgroups as regards {{the form of the}} neck and the skull. Plesiosaurs can be divided into two major morphological types that differ in head and neck size. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs", such as Cryptoclididae, Elasmosauridae, and Plesiosauridae, had long necks and small heads. [...] "Pliosauromorphs", such as the Pliosauridae and the Rhomaleosauridae, had shorter necks with a large, elongated head. The neck length variations were not caused by an elongation of the individual neck vertebrae, but by increasing the number of these cervical vertebrae. Elasmosaurus has seventy-two neck vertebrae; the known record is held by the elasmosaurid Albertonectes, with seventy-six cervicals. The large number of joints implied suggested to early researchers that the neck <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> flexible; indeed, a swan-like curvature of the neck was assumed to be possible - in Icelandic plesiosaurs are even called Svaneðlur, [...] "swan lizards". However, modern research has confirmed an earlier conjecture of Williston that the long plate-like spines on top of the vertebrae, the processus spinosi, strongly limited a vertical movement. Although horizontal curving was less restricted, in general the neck must have been rather stiff and certainly was incapable of being bent into serpentine coils. This is even more true of the short-necked [...] "pliosauromophs", which had as few as eleven cervicals. With early forms, the amphicoelous or amphiplat neck vertebrae bore double-headed neck ribs; later forms had single-headed ribs. In the remainder of the vertebral column, the number of dorsal vertebrae varied between about nineteen and thirty-two, of the sacral vertebrae between two and six, and of the tail vertebrae between about twenty-one and thirty-two. These vertebrae still possessed the original processes inherited from the land-dwelling ancestors of the Sauropterygia and had not been reduced to fish-like simple discs, as happened with the vertebrae of ichthyosaurs. The tail vertebrae possessed chevron bones. The dorsal vertebrae of plesiosaurs are easily recognisable by two large foramina subcentralia, paired vascular openings at the underside.|$|E
