5000|$|However, between 1863 and 1880 {{the pace}} of {{conspiracy}} indictments picked up again. At least fifteen cases were brought during that time. [...] Despite Hunt’s softening of the conspiracy doctrine, convictions were still obtained and harsh sentences imposed. For instance, in 1869, members of a <b>mine</b> <b>committee</b> in Pottsville, Pennsylvania were found guilty of conspiracy, sentenced to jail for thirty days and heavily fined. [...] Prosecutions in this period led to labor efforts to gain relief through legislation. In 1869, Pennsylvania passed a statute declaring labor unions legal if formed for “mutual aid, benefit, and protection” and when convictions continued to be obtained, passed another law in 1872 providing that laborers could collectively refuse to work for any employer. [...] The need for such legislation suggests that Hunt, while beneficial for labor, was hardly a guarantee that workers {{would be able to}} organize without fear of legal repercussion.|$|E

The establishment of a Mining Department at the Bulawayo Technical School was a result of the deliberations of a Special Committee appointed by the then Minister of <b>Mines.</b> A <b>committee</b> was the mandated ‘to consider the best means of affording technical education and practical training for youths who wished to enter the Mining Industry.’ The scheme also received approval from the then Rhodesia Chamber of Mines, which at that time was headquartered in Bulawayo.

25|$|A Defense Committee {{publicist}} {{wrote an}} article about the first trial that was published in The New Republic.

The <b>Committee</b> eventually added staff from outside the anarchist movement, notably Mary Donovan, who had experience as a labor leader and Sinn Féin organizer. In 1927, she and Felicani together recruited Gardner Jackson, a Boston Globe reporter from a wealthy family, to manage publicity and serve as a mediator between the Committee's anarchists and the growing number of supporters with more liberal political views, who included socialites, lawyers, and intellectuals.|$|R
