5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense,</b> because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2014, after a {{television}} series {{extension of the}} One-Shot Agent Carter was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked {{about the possibility of}} him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, [...] "I get to mix {{a lot of things that}} don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." [...] He researched [...] "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." [...] This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, [...] "which <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".|$|E

[...] However, if the primary MX's failure is considered authoritative (i.e. it is the primary server for a non-arbitrary reason), attempting to deliver to secondary MX servers is not only a waste of time but potentially a waste of expensive resources, depending on the reason why the secondary servers have higher preference values.|$|E
5000|$|The live mixing {{technique}} he {{is often}} credited with is adding a high mid [...] "click" [...] to the bass drum, which evolved early on with Metallica {{as a means of}} lifting Lars Ulrich's bass drums out of the bottom heavy sound.

[...] Sarah Rainey, writing for The Daily Telegraph gave it {{four out of five}} stars, called it a [...] "bitter-sweet offering" [...] and said: [...] "The script offered a good mix of humour and poignancy, and there were also some unexpectedly lovely scenes of the countryside". Ellen Jones of The Independent said: [...] "The laboriously regional script didnt make it any easier.

5000|$|In an August 2007 interview, Jimmy Wales, {{co-founder of}} Wikipedia, used the Welsh Wikipedia {{as an example}} of the {{rationale}} for having Wikipedias in smaller languages: Certainly within Wikipedia right now we are seeing some fairly successful projects in small European languages. You don't really need a Welsh language Wikipedia, perhaps. The number of people who speak Welsh who don't also speak English is very small and getting smaller every year. So why do we have a Welsh Wikipedia? Well, people wanted it, so they're making it. And language preservation is the main motive. It is their mother tongue and they want to keep it alive, keep its literature alive. Certainly some of the larger small languages like Basque and Catalan have very successful projects. I definitely see that preserving parts of your language and culture through collaborative projects <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E
5000|$|And {{the third}} bit, about execution, it really {{comes down to}} {{production}} value. The teams that are working really well on mobile right now I think bring a lot of production value but don't necessarily bring a lot of scope, which I think <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> for the device. Because the play pattern on mobile is so much different from other platforms in terms of how people engage with the game. Some people will sit on a couch for a long time, but often they don't. Often they'll be in and out. And you have to keep that in mind, to design to that play pattern. How you treat scope has a big impact on that. Designing big long levels where you have to engage 30 minutes at a time doesn't work so well. Creating scope for production value is good…everyone loves production value, right? Great story, great visuals--bringing that to the platform could be really cool." ...|$|E

Blake laid out his way for Clint to play his part. To me, it was clearly apparent that Blake's way was in no way how Clint saw the part. Clint didn't say anything except his Gary Cooper comments like 'Yup' and 'Nope.' Clint and I went home in his truck and he still didn't say anything until we were halfway there. Finally he said, 'I guess this won't be the film we do together.' I said, 'I didn't think so.' Warner Bros. really wanted to make the film. I think they thought like I did that it would be one of those pictures which would look great in the catalogue... Clint likes a director he gets along with, which <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> to me... Blake's dismissal hurt him badly. I don't think he's ever gotten over it.|$|E
