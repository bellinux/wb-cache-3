25|$|The bulk of {{remaining}} commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest {{towns and villages}} must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service {{can be attributed to}} the Alaska bypass <b>mail</b> <b>program</b> which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was {{released}} on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256MB and a built-in FireWire port. Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated <b>Mail</b> <b>program</b> with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used {{a modified version of}} Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, {{with the exception of the}} Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.|$|E

5000|$|The Netmail Suite {{consisted}} of a <b>mail</b> transfer <b>program</b> and two <b>mail</b> handling <b>programs.</b> The <b>mail</b> transfer <b>program,</b> called MDRIVer, was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems. The <b>mail</b> handling <b>programs</b> were used to [...] "bag" [...] mail and prepare it for transfer (MBAGger), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (MDIST).|$|R
50|$|A caging list, in {{the direct}} mail industry, {{is a list}} or {{database}} of addresses that is updated after a <b>mailing</b> <b>program</b> is completed, with notations on responses and corrections for addresses whose mail has been returned as undeliverable or has been forwarded.|$|R

50|$|The {{program can}} be {{integrated}} with the mail server to automatically filter all mail for a site. It can also be run by individual users on their own mailbox and integrates with several <b>mail</b> <b>programs.</b> SpamAssassin is highly configurable; if used as a system-wide filter it can still be configured to support per-user preferences.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the compact}} format also had its problems. The 6-bit {{encoding}} produced {{a number of}} characters that some foreign-language <b>mail</b> <b>programs</b> would convert into local versions, thereby destroying the file. In addition, the file metadata information was still placed in the file in plain text, and therefore could become corrupted in the same fashion.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} the UNIX <b>mail</b> <b>program</b> sendmail {{contained}} this bug: when mail was delivered from another system, the <b>mail</b> <b>program</b> was being run non-interactively. If the destination address was local, but {{referred to a}} user name {{not found in the}} local password file, the message sent back to the originator of the email was the announcement that the person they were attempting to communicate with was not a typewriter.|$|E

5000|$|Typically either {{variant of}} the {{application}} is {{set up in a}} generic <b>mail</b> filter <b>program,</b> or it is called directly from a mail user agent that supports this, whenever new mail arrives. <b>Mail</b> filter <b>programs</b> such as procmail can be made to pipe all incoming mail through SpamAssassin with an adjustment to user's [...]procmailrc file.|$|R
5000|$|Physician outreach: When study {{recruitment}} {{depends in}} large part on physician referrals, outreach measures can include forums where doctors, specialists, and healthcare providers gather to view a presentation on the study and how their patient pool may be eligible for participation.

25|$|Worldwide, {{the most}} common method of prepaying postage is by buying an {{adhesive}} postage stamp {{to be applied to}} the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid envelope. Franking is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large <b>mail</b> <b>programs,</b> such as banks and direct mail companies.|$|R
50|$|Spammers {{sometimes}} use various {{means to}} confirm addresses as deliverable. For instance, including a hidden Web bug in a spam message written in HTML may cause the recipient's mail client to transmit the recipient's address, {{or any other}} unique key, to the spammer's Web site. Users can defend against such abuses by turning off their <b>mail</b> <b>program's</b> option to display images, or by reading email as plain-text rather than formatted.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} BBS networks, as {{use of the}} Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline. Today, the GT Power Network {{continues}} on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before. Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and Linux native BBS applications. These other applications {{do not support the}} GT Power proprietary <b>mail</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1998, the U.S. Postal Service {{authorised}} {{the first}} tests of a secure system of sending digital franks via the Internet to be printed {{out on a}} PC printer, obviating the necessity to license a dedicated franking machine and allowing companies with smaller <b>mail</b> <b>programs</b> {{to make use of}} the option; this was later expanded to test the use of personalised postage. The service provided by the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 allows the franks to be printed out on special adhesive-backed labels.|$|R

50|$|The University of Minnesota Computer Center (UCC as it {{was called}} then) {{rejected}} implementing MULTI due to concerns about system stability. UCC tried to retrofit the MULTI-mail program for its own use because of the good user interface. It was not possible. They then tried again with an older fast access system file version, and while it worked, it was unreliable. After doing test runs with several other Universities <b>mail</b> <b>programs,</b> two developers at UCC implemented their own version, which also contained a message board feature, and was the campus wide e-mail solution for a couple of years.|$|R
