40|$|The {{control chart}} {{is a very}} popular tool of {{statistical}} process control.

Shewhart-type control charts are sensitive for large disturbances in the process, whereas cumulative sum (CUSUM) -type and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) -type control charts are intended to spot small and moderate disturbances. In this article, we proposed a <b>mixed</b> EWMA-CUSUM control <b>chart</b> for detecting a shift in the process mean and evaluated its average run lengths. Comparisons of the proposed control chart were made with some representative control charts including the classical CUSUM, classical EWMA, fast initial response CUSUM, fast initial response EWMA, adaptive CUSUM with EWMA-based shift estimator, weighted CUSUM and runs rules-based CUSUM and EWMA. The comparisons revealed that <b>mixing</b> the two <b>charts</b> makes the proposed scheme even more sensitive to the small shifts in the process mean than the other schemes designed for detecting small shifts...|$|R
