25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster.</b> The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E

40|$|Swedish {{agriculture}} is currently undergoing radical changes {{with respect to}} the working environment. New production milking systems may alter the physical workload and thus {{have an effect on the}} development of musculoskeletal disorders. Earlier studies have shown that there is a manifest risk of suffering injury to the forearm, wrist and hand during machine milking especially during the attaching task (when holding the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> in one hand while attaching the four teat-cups to the udder). High degrees of dorsiflexion and deviation of the wrist in combination with peak values of muscle activity in the forearm during milking might contribute injuries to the wrist and hand. Large-scale milk production increases the time spent performing the tasks involved. As a consequence, the cumulative engagement in extreme positions and rapid movements, and high level of muscular load on the upper extremities will also increase. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the workload on the milker's forearm, wrist and hands resulting from using the prototype of a device designed to facilitate the attaching task. The device is constructed as a support arm where the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> is suspended in order to reduce the workload. The study was carried out in a loose-housing system where the cows come to be milked in a parlour. Eleven milkers participated in the study. The muscle activity in the biceps and the forearm flexors, as well as positions and movements of the wrists were measured by electromyography and electrogoniometry. The attaching task was measured both with and without the device. When the prototype was used only a minor decrease in the muscular load on the holding side was recorded. Surprisingly, the effect on the wrist positions and movements was small. This marginal effect could be due to the fact that all the milkers were used to milking without the support arm and despite the training period, they were unable to make full use of the device...|$|E

The experiment was conducted at Livestock Research Station (LRS), National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. A herd of 12 animals (water buffaloes) were milked {{for more than one}} year. Machine milking of buffaloes was the first experience of its kind in Pakistan. The results were encouraging. Type and length of stimulation phase, size of teat cup liner, suited vacuum level, weight of <b>milking</b> <b>cluster,</b> milk capacity of claw piece, way of attachment of cluster and milking with single and double clusters were included as variables. The best suited size of teat cup liner for the milked animals was 25 mm in diameter among the liners used. The 2. 1 kg cluster which was having light teat cup shells and stainless steel claw piece proved to be superior for the smooth and sponge like teats.

40|$|Prevention {{of damage}} to the teat and {{mastitis}} requires determination of the teat load caused by a collapsing liner. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type. Both film types measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the teat cup liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and an artificial teat. Based on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both film types combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a collapsing liner...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 146 {{multiparous}} lactating Arabian camels at mid lactation, machine milked twice-daily and managed under intensive conditions {{were used to}} study the morphological traits of the udder for on-field udder evaluation. Pictures {{from the left side}} of the udder were obtained with a digital camera immediately before milking for later study. Udder and teat measures (using a standard reference) and shape typology were assessed by 3 evaluators from the digital pictures. Results revealed that Arabian dairy camels had well developed udders with large sized teats. Typology of the whole udder glands showed that the globular shape (47. 3 %) was the most common, followed by pear (34. 3 %) and pendulous (18. 4 %) shapes. Regarding the teats, conical or funnel was the most frequent shape (63. 2 % and 58. 7 % for front and rear teats, respectively) followed by cylindrical (26. 4 and 32. 5 %, respectively) and blew-up (8. 7 and 10. 4 %, respectively). Udder linear score repeatabilities among classifiers were moderate for udder depth (0. 69), udder floor inclination (0. 64), teat shape (0. 69), teat length (0. 64) and teat width (0. 45). We concluded that dairy camels need specific <b>milking</b> <b>clusters,</b> as well as selection by morphology for improving their machine milkability. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in camel's milk for human nutrition due to its functional properties. As a result of market demands for milk production, intensive dairy camel's farms using modern machine milking have been recently estabilished around the world. Efficient milking {{are related to the}} good milking ability of animal (machine milked). Camels should be chosen with good udder and teat conformations because of its direct effects on ease of milking and milk hygiene. There are a huge variation in size of teats (length and diameter) between camels. These variations might cause some problems during machine milking and require special settings and practice during milking. Therefore, the necessity to design specific <b>milking</b> <b>clusters</b> for lactating camels, with longer and wider cups than dairy cows. Milking camels at 50 kPa and 60 pulsations/min improved milking efficiency without affecting teat condition and udder health; camels were able to let down more milk in a shorter time at higher milk flow rate. Compared to other dairy animals, camels have a very limited cisternal cavity. Therefore, insufficient udder and teat stimulation will lead to incomplete milking. It is recommended to extend the duration of udder and teat stimulation (90 to 120 sec) before milking. Further studies are needed to confirm these results during the entire lactation period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two different milking procedures on teat length and diameter, milk yield and milking time. During the first milking procedure the milker decides when to remove the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> from the udder, while in the second an automatic cluster removal, when milk flow was lower than 200 g/min, was performed. Measurements were made on two commercial farms B and A on 15 randomly chosen cows without any clinical sign of mastitis. There were no significant differencesbetween those farms in teat length and diameter differences before and after the milking. Average milking time on farm A was 6 min and 58 s, while on farm B was 5 min and 3 s. Average milk yield was 12. 9 kg on farm B and 13. 4 kg on farm A. Milking time was considerably shorter on farm B compared to farm A, while milk yield was almost equal on both farms. Automatic cluster weighting 2 kg removal was performed when milk flow was lower than 200 g/min in order to shorten the time needed to milk the cow, ensuring good udder health...|$|E
40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) {{have become}} the main {{pathogens}} causing bovine mastitis in recent years. A huge variation in species distribution among herds has been observed in several studies, emphasizing the need to identify subgroup- and species specific herd-level factors to improve {{our understanding of the}} differences in ecological and epidemiological nature between species. The use of bulk milk samples enables the inclusion of a large(r) number of herds needed to identify herd-level risk factors and increases the likelihood of recovering enough isolates per species needed for conducting subgroup- and, eventually, species-specific analyses at the same time. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and distribution of CNS species in bulk milk samples and to identify associated subgroup- and species-specific herd-level factors. Ninety percent of all bulk milk samples yielded CNS. Staphylococcus equorum was the predominant species, followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. A seasonal effect was observed for several CNS species. Bulk milk samples from herds with a loose-pack or a tiestall housing system were more likely to yield CNS species compared with herds with a freestall barn, except for S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus cohnii. In September, herds in which udders were clipped had lower odds of yielding Staphylococcus chromogenes, S. simulans, and Staphylococcus xylosus, the CNS species assumed to be most relevant for udder health, in their bulk milk than herds in which udder clipping was not practiced. Bulk milk of herds participating in a monthly veterinary udder health-monitoring program was more likely to yield these 3 CNS species. Herds always receiving their milk quality premium or predisinfecting teats before attachment of the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> had lower odds of having S. equorum in their bulk milk. Herds not using a single dry cotton or paper towel for each cow during premilking udder preparation {{were more likely to have}} S. cohnii-positive bulk milk. Herds in which flushing with hot water or steam of the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> after having milked a cow with a (sub) clinical mastitis was applied, were less likely to yield S. simulans, S. haemolyticus, and S. cohnii in their bulk milk. Always wearing gloves during milking decreased the odds of having Staphylococcus devriesei-positive bulk milk. Tap water from the public drinking system used as drinking water increased the odds of yielding S. simulans in the bulk milk. In conclusion, CNS are highly prevalent in bulk milk and might originate from the environment for some species (we hypothesize this is true for S. equorum or S. cohnii), or from within the udder (e. g., for S. simulans). Studies collecting bulk milk and quarter milk samples at the same time along with environmental samples are needed to determine the exact origin of the different (subgroups of) CNS species present in bulk milk using strain-typing techniques...|$|E

The milking {{characteristics of}} three designs of single-teatcup milking units {{were compared with}} a conventional milking unit in a pipeline milking system. The combined weight of each single-teatcup shell and liner used in the single-teatcup units was 0. 18 kg, 0. 38 kg or 0. 56 kg. The conventional <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> had a claw volume of 150 mL and a weight of 3. 16 kg. The single sets of teatcups were applied manually and removed automatically when milk flow from the four teatcups reached 0. 2 kg/min.

At a flow rate of 4 L/min during simulated milking the mean vacuum level at the teat-end (artificial teat) during the “bphase” of pulsation was 43. 8 kPa with the conventional milking unit and 33 kPa for the three single-teatcup units. The corresponding mean and minimum teat-end vacuum in the “d-phase” were 38. 46 kPa and 29. 54 kPa, respectively, for the conventional system and 24. 95 kPa and 17. 59 kPa, respectively, for the single-teatcup configuration.

40|$|Oxytocin can {{attenuate}} {{the physiological}} and behavioral response to stress in animals. In {{this study we}} investigated the relationship between plasma oxytocin concentrations and the behavioral and physiological response of dairy cows to a repeated psychological stressor (novel environment). Twenty lactating multi-parous dairy cows were milked in a familiar milking parlor and in a novel environment. Blood samples were collected before and after milking in the familiar parlor (baseline) and on the second and fifth day in the novel parlor to measure plasma cortisol and oxytocin concentrations. Heart rate was recorded on all cows during milking in the familiar and novel environment. On all test days, the behavioral response of cows to <b>milk</b> <b>cluster</b> attachment was scored. On day 2 in the novel parlor, the oxytocin response, cortisol concentrations and heart rate were greater, and heart rate variability was lower than baseline values recorded in the familiar parlor. The {{results from this study}} suggest that oxytocin release is increased in response to exposure to a psychological stressor (novel environment) and that cows adapt to this stressor over time. After initial suppression, oxytocin levels increased over days of milking in a novel environment, whereas indicators of stress simultaneously decreased. Furthermore, the oxytocin increase was associated with habituation of the cortisol response in anticipation of milking in a novel environment, suggesting that oxytocin may be involved in habituation to a novel environment in dairy cows. This mechanism of habituation to novel environments may reflect an association between oxytocin and a "familiarization-habituation response" to repeated exposure to an initially novel environment that has previously been reported in humans...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{images from}} {{the left side of the}} mammary gland of 146 {{multiparous}} lactating dromedary camels in mid lactation and managed under intensive conditions were obtained immediately before milking and used to build up a reference scheme for the morphological evaluation of camel mammary glands. A 5 -point linear scoring scheme (with 0. 5 -point accuracy) was subsequently generated based on five mammary traits (udder, depth and floor inclination, teats, shape, length, and width). Results showed that Arabian dairy camels had voluminous udders with large-sized teats. Most common udder shape was globular (47. 3 %), followed by the pear (34. 3 %) and pendulous (18. 4 %) shapes. Conical- or funnel-shaped teats (60. 9 %) were the most frequent, followed by cylindrical- (29. 5 %) and blew-up (9. 6 %) -shaped teats. The observed variation in the udder and teat measurements, as well as in typology, attested that dromedary camels need especially large <b>milking</b> <b>clusters</b> to improve their machine milkability. Assessment of the previously indicated digital images according to the proposed linear scoring scheme, performed by 3 independent operators showed that the overall means were close to 3. 00 points (values between 2. 45 and 3. 62), and the standard deviations were close to 0. 76 points (values between 0. 58 and 0. 94). Moderate repeatability between operators (r >[*] 0. 69) was obtained for udder depth and floor inclination, indicating that training of operators, as well as improvements in the definition of traits should be considered in future studies. Further research is needed to validate the proposed linear scoring system in different stages of lactation and parities using a large number of camels. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The selected cows had a milk cell concentration below 100 000 cells/ml in the course of every probation milking during the cow milk recording enquiry of the current lactation. In addition California-Mastitis-Test and microbiological analysis had been negative at the day of measurement. The measurements were carried out using a MyLab 30 Vet XVISION® ultrasound scanner with a linear array probe. The analysis was supported by MyLab™Desk® as well as PixelFlux® software. During ultrasound scanning the right front teat was immersed in warmed contact jelly in an angled bowl. Measurements in cross section at the changeover of udder quarter and the teat as well as in longitudinal cut were made. Circumference and area of the teat and of the teat-cistern at the cross section and teat-canal length, teat-wall thickness, teat-end width and teat cistern width at the longitudinal cut were evaluated. The teat-tissue area at the cross section was calculated. Measurements were started three hours before afternoon milking and were repeated every 15 minutes until milking. Directly after the removal of the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> an additional measurement was performed. Subsequently, measurements took place every 10 minutes for the next 40 minutes. Thereafter, measurements were done every 15 minutes until 175 minutes after milking. Results: • Color Angiography is suited for measuring the blood flow of the teats of dairy cows. • Directly after the removal of the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster,</b> the blood flow density of seven (MP 1) respectively eight (MP 4) out of the ten selected cows was reduced. • All cows showed a high significant increase of blood flow density after the first measurement following milking. • Teat channel length upon milking is significantly longer than immediately before milking and is reduced again afterwards. It does not reach its original length during the measuring period. • The teat end width does not change significantly during the whole measurement period. • Up to milking the cistern width increases, and after milking it is significantly reduced. From the first measurement after milking it starts increasing again. • The teat wall is significantly thicker after milking than before. • Teat area and teat width are significantly smaller directly after milking than before. Following the first measurement after milking, they are reduced. • Cistern area and cistern width are significantly smaller after milking than immediately before.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} a new quarter-individual milking system called MultiLactor ® (Siliconform GmbH, Türkheim, Germany). The MultiLactor enables milking on quarter level basis with low vacuum (37 kPa), sequential pulsation and periodic air inlet. Within the same dairy farm, the influence of this quarter-individual milking system (MULTI) on milkability traits was compared with a conventional milking system (CON). CON was equipped with a conventional <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> and used alternating pulsation. Vacuum level was adjusted to 40 kPa. For the study, 84 Holstein Friesian cows were randomly selected and uniformly divided into two herds. During the 30 -week survey, the milk flow curves were recorded every other week by using a LactoCorder (WMB, Balgach, Switzerland). Significant differences (P< 0. 05) between both milking systems were found for all milk flow traits, except for milk yield and decline phase. Concerning the incline (tAN) and plateau (tPL) phase, large differences existed between MULTI and CON. The estimated value of tAN calculated for MULTI (29. 4 s) took {{only half of the}} time when calculated for CON (56. 4 s). The estimated value of tPL at CON was reduced by 1. 43 min (35 %) compared to MULTI. Milking process at MULTI (8. 49 min) took longer time than for CON (7. 43 min). From the study, it was concluded that the effect of shorter tAN in the quarter-individual milked cows may be related to additional prestimulation by an actuator.

For this purpose, twenty-two healthy Italian Mediterranean buffaloes in their first to third lactation and in early lactation (< 120 days in milk) were subjected to two treatments of teat stimulation: i) washing of the teats with water for about 5 s and attaching of the milking unit within 60 s, without any pre-milking massage (farm milking routine); ii) fast pulsation (FP), achieved by increasing pulsation rate to 120 pulsations per min during the first 60 s after application of teat cups. Each treatment lasted for 10 days and the following parameters were measured: milk yield (kg/milking), milk yield at 2 min after unit attachment (kg), time between milking unit attachment and its automatic removal (min), peak milk flow rate (kg/min), and milking time to reach peak flow rate (min). The average milk flow rate (kg/min) was calculated by dividing milk yield by the actual milking time. Milk yield was not affected by mechanical pre-stimulation and during the first 2 min of milking 20. 2 % and 19. 6 % of total milk yield were milked respectively when treatments 1 and 2 were applied.

40|$|Eight cows were machine milked {{either in}} an {{operating}} theatre {{or in their}} familiar barn. During the experiments, milk flow curves were recorded and blood samples were taken for determination of concentrations of oxytocin, prolactin, cortisol and β-endorphin. The <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> was attached without udder preparation. After cessation of milk flow, air was blown into the vagina for 2 min. When milk flow had stopped again, 1 i. u. oxytocin and finally 10 i. u. oxytocin were injected to remove the remaining milk. After the start of milking, oxytocin remained basal in unfamiliar, but increased in familiar surroundings. Therefore, during normal milking only 9 % of total milk was removed in unfamiliar, whereas 79 % was available in familiar surroundings. In response to subsequent vaginal stimulation in the operating theatre, oxytocin increased transiently in five cows and 15 - 71 % of the milk was removed in these animals. In the other three cows in the operating theatre, oxytocin remained basal during vaginal stimulation, and no more milk was available. After injection of 1 i. u. oxytocin, 56 and 11 %, and after injection of 10 i. u. oxytocin, 13 and 8 % of milk was removed in unfamiliar and familiar surroundings respectively. Concentrations of prolactin increased {{during the course of}} milking in both treatments. Premilking concentrations of cortisol and β-endorphin were elevated in unfamiliar as compared with familiar surroundings. During the course of milking, cortisol increased slightly and β-endorphin decreased in unfamiliar, whereas both hormones increased markedly during milking in familiar surroundings. We conclude that disturbed milk removal in unfamiliar surroundings is due to central inhibition of oxytocin release during normal milking and partly also to a response to vaginal stimulation.

Eight animals served as control (group C), whereas 7 animals received in the morning a pre-partum training for at least 7 days (group T). During the pre-partum training sessions, an animal was moved to the milking parlour (tandem 3 x 3) and left for 10 min in the milking stall, where the udder was thoroughly washed and massaged for 1 min. The massage included the stripping of the teats. Once calved, all the heifers were observed in the parlour for their first milking then on 7 occasions (3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 days after calving) during afternoon milking. The behaviours, recorded from the entrance in the milking stall to the removal of <b>milking</b> <b>cluster,</b> were step (foot lifted less than 15 cm off of the ground) and kick (foot raised above 15 cm off of the ground, even if a clear kick was not visible).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of machine milking on behaviour, milk production and milk quality of jennies. Four Martina Franca and four Ragusana jennies were used. Five jennies had no experience of machine milking (group NE), whereas other three had (group E). Milking was performed by a portable milking unit once a week from 20 to 140 days in milk and residual milk was dripped by hand. Before milking foals were separated from the mothers at different time intervals. The behaviours, recorded from the attachment to the removal of <b>milking</b> <b>cluster,</b> were step (foot lifted less than 15 cm off of the ground) and kick (raised more than 15 cm off of the ground, even if a clear kick was not visible). In addition, defecation, urination and vocalisation were recorded as a single behavioural activity, but this activity was observed so rarely that {{was not included in}} the statistical analysis. Duration of milking, milk yield and quantity of dripped milk were also registered. Data were analysed by using the mixed procedure of SAS with day of lactation as repeated factor, experience as non repeated factor and time of separation of foal as covariate. The jenny was considered random. In addition, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to determine the correlation between variables. The number of steps (1. 29 ± 0. 56 vs 1. 61 ± 0. 43 n/min; for groups E and NE, respectively) and kicks (0. 34 ± 0. 26 vs 0. 56 ± 0. 20 n/min; for groups E and NE, respectively) expressed by jennies during machine milking was very low. These variables along with duration of milking were not affected by experience (2. 87 ± 0. 29 vs 2. 94 ± 0. 22 min; for groups E and NE, respectively). Conversely, time of separation from foals had a significant influence on duration of milking and number of kicks (P< 0. 01). Duration of milking increased with the time of separation (r= 0. 294; P< 0. 01), whereas, even if not significantly, the number of kicks decreased as the time of separation from foals increased (r=- 0. 147). It can be concluded that jennies rapidly habituate to machine milking, although their behavioural response may be affected by the time of separation from foals...|$|E
40|$|Good udder {{health is}} not only {{important}} for the dairy farmer but, because of increasing interest of consumers in the way dairy products are produced, also for the dairy production chain as a whole. An important role of veterinarians is in advising on production diseases such as mastitis. A large part of this advice is given around the planning of management to maintain or improve the udder health status of a farm. Mastitis is a costly disease, due to losses (a reduction of output due to mastitis) and expenditure (additional inputs to reduce the level of mastitis). Worldwide, published estimates of the economic losses of clinical mastitis range from € 61 to € 97 per cow on a farm, with large differences between farms, e. g. in The Netherlands, losses due to clinical and subclinical mastitis varied between € 17 and € 198 per cow per year. Moreover, farmers tended to underestimate these costs. This indicates that for {{a large proportion of}} farms there are many avoidable losses. In order to provide good support to farmers' decision-making, it is important to describe the mastitis setting {{not only in terms of}} disease, e. g. incidence of clinical mastitis, but also in monetary terms; and to make good decisions, it is necessary to provide the dairy farmer with information on the additional expenditure and reduced losses associated with alternative decisions. Six out of 18 preventive measures were shown to have a positive nett benefit, viz blanket use of dry-cow therapy, keeping cows standing after milking, back-flushing of the <b>milk</b> <b>cluster</b> after <b>milking</b> a cow with clinical mastitis, application of a treatment protocol, washing dirty udders, and the use of milkers' gloves. For those measures that included a large amount of routine labour or investment, the reduced losses did not outweigh the additional expenditure. The advisor cannot expect that measures that are cost-effective are always implemented. Reasons for this are the objectives of the dairy farmer can be other than maximisation of profit, resources to improve the mastitis situation compete with other fields of management, risk involved with the decision, economic behaviour of the dairy farmer, and valuation of the cost factors by the dairy farmer. For all decision-makers this means that, although financial incentives do have an effect on the management of mastitis, it is not always sufficient to show the economic benefits of improved management to induce an improvement of management of mastitis...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infections on an organic dairy farm was monitored for 10 months. Environmental and milk {{samples were collected}} from a total of 26 cows {{and a group of}} 21 purchased heifers about to be introduced into the milking herd. There was variation in the rate of isolation of S. aureus (9. 5 to 43. 8 %) from individual mammary quarters, although no S. aureus isolates were detected in the milk samples collected from the heifers. One hundred ninety-one S. aureus isolates were detected from cow milk samples (n = 182), <b>milking</b> machine <b>clusters</b> (n = 4), farm personnel (n = 4), and the environment (n = 1). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) had a typeability of 100 % when it was applied to the 191 isolates. Among the 191 isolates there was limited strain diversity, with seven sequence types (STs) dominated by two strains with closely related STs that differed at a single locus. Within individual mammary quarters there were naturally occurring dual infections, although this was identified in only 0. 4 % of milk samples. Different strains were associated with variable persistence within quarters. MLST is clearly a very suitable tool for the differentiation and analysis of S. aureus populations detected on dairy cattle farms...|$|R
40|$|Background Data linking risk of type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) {{and dietary}} patterns in Chinese populations are scarce. Methods A population-based prospective study of 64 191 middle-aged women in urban Shanghai, China, who were free of T 2 D and other chronic diseases at study recruitment, was conducted. Dietary intake, phys-ical activity and anthropometric measurements were assessed through in-person interviews. Dietary patterns were assessed by using K-means cluster analysis. Cox regression model {{was used to evaluate}} the association of dietary patterns with the risk of T 2 D. Results We identified three dietary clusters in this population. Cluster 1 (56. 3 %; N 36 159) had the highest intake of staples, cluster 2 (40. 4 %: N 25 948) had the highest intake of dairy <b>milk,</b> and <b>cluster</b> 3 (2. 9 %; N 1843) had the highest energy intake. Participants in cluster 2 had lower prevalence of obesity, central obesity and hypertension at baseline.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} some of the underlying principles for milking management of Murrah buffaloes. The study was carried out through five experiments, four on an experimental farm in India and one as a field survey. From the results {{it was observed that}} the total cisternal area and cisternal fraction of milk in Murrah buffaloes was smaller than in dairy cattle, sheep and goat. Teats were longer and thicker and had longer teat canals than reported in dairy cattle. Teats were flaccid and empty prior to milk ejection due to the small cisternal fraction of milk, while during milk ejection there was a remarkable increase in teat dimensions and cisternal area. Commencement of milk flow during machine milking took longer without pre-stimulation than in the other dairy species due to the small cisternal fraction of milk. The combined stimulation of feeding during milking and manual pre-stimulation resulted in a faster and more pronounced release of oxytocin, prolactin and cortisol compared to milking with only manual pre-stimulation and no pre-stimulation. Small changes in the milking routines adversely effect oxytocin release, milk ejection and complete removal of milk, which was also reflected in the stripping yield and fat percent in stripping milk. The daily rhythm of maintenance behaviour of buffaloes with mechanisation of some farm chores was comparable to those without mechanisation. However, increased access to roughage increased the resting behaviour and the animals ate longer during the night as well. The milking management systems and the herd size {{had an impact on the}} udder health status of buffaloes. The prevalence of mastitis was lower in the small buffalo farms where buffaloes were stimulated by calf suckling and hand milked compared to large farms where the buffaloes were manually pre-stimulated and hand milked or machine milked. In conclusion, during machine milking of buffaloes owing to the small cisternal milk fraction, attaching the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster</b> prior to milk ejection could lead to higher teat penetration in the teat cup and milking on empty teats. To prevent a possible irritation and stress due to machine milking without milk flow at high vacuum, milk removal should be synchronised with milk ejection. It is thus necessary to improve machine milking settings for buffaloes and to develop ISO standards optimised to suit the anatomical and physiological characteristics of buffaloes. Training of milkers and milking machine users is also important for improving the udder health and welfare of buffaloes...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} milking system (AMS) enables cows to be milked by a milking robot at fairly regular intervals, more or less voluntarily, {{and without}} human supervision. To reduce the cost and simplify the operation of an AMS for dairy farmers, the selection stall, where the system's computer decides whether cows are to be milked or not, was removed and the selection process {{was transferred to the}} milking stalls. The behaviour of 18 dairy cows in study 1 and 24 dairy cows in study 2 was investigated in a section of a loose housing system in which such an AMS was installed. In study 1, 18 cows had free access to the AMS from 0500 to 2300 hours. Per day, each cow paid on average 2. 8 (SD= 0. 2) milking visits (cow was milked), 2. 0 (SD= 1. 4) non-milking visits (cow was not milked), and 0. 3 (SD= 0. 4) milking-failure visits (robot failed to attach <b>milking</b> <b>cluster)</b> to the AMS. In study 2, 24 cows had free access to the AMS 24 h a day. Each cow paid on average 2. 8 (SD= 0. 4) milking visits, 2. 5 (SD= 2. 0) non-milking visits, and 0. 7 (SD= 1. 7) milking-failure visits to the AMS daily. In both studies, the type of visit a cow paid to the AMS determined the time interval until her next visit. In study 1, time intervals were: 321 min (SEM= 12) after milking visits, 145 min (SEM= 16) after non-milking visits, 115 min (SEM= 10) after milking-failure visits. In study 2, time intervals were: 337 min (SEM= 14) after milking visits, 117 min (SEM= 17) after non-milking visits, 164 min (SEM= 13) after milking-failure visits. In both studies, cows spent the longest time in the entry area of the AMS during non-milking visits (29 s (SEM= 5) study 1; 33 s (SEM= 3) study 2). Cows left the milking stalls slowest during non-milking visits in study 1 (10 s, SEM= 1), and during milking-failure visits in study 2 (18 s, SEM= 5). They spent the longest time in the exit area of the AMS after non-milking visits in study 1 (202 s, SEM= 23), and after milking-failure visits in study 2 (141 s, SEM= 28). In both studies, they defecated and urinated in the exit area. It was concluded that cows that {{do not need to be}} milked will enter the AMS if there is no selection stall to prevent unwarranted visits, and that cow traffic inside the system is slow. The combination of non-milking visits and slow cow traffic will lower the milking efficiency of the AMS...|$|E
40|$|In robotic milking {{there is}} always a slight chance of failure to attach the <b>milking</b> <b>cluster.</b> Attachment failure is most likely for cows whose udder {{conformation}} is less convenient for robot attachment. In general, after milking failure cows try to revisit the milking robot if they are not sent to a separate area. Since it is difficult to estimate the effect of milking failure on such a cow and her welfare in conditions of robotic milking, a specific 16 -day trial was conducted on 12 cows. These cows were milked in a milking parlour with six milking stalls. Each afternoon milking, three cows were not milked. All the cows were closely observed in the cubicle house for 1 h after the afternoon milking. Thereafter, all cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time and the three unmilked cows were milked. In total, each cow was observed 12 times after milking and four times after omitted milking. The following behavioural traits were registered: time budget for the 1 h, occurrence and time until eating, drinking, lying, urination and defecation, and aggressive interactions. Milking order was defined on the basis of how often a cow came to the milking parlour in the first batch of six cows. Moreover, the data related to the milk yield {{and the use of the}} automatic feeding installation with the complete diet were analysed. After omitted milking, only the cows from the first batch stood longer in cubicles (14. 2 min of 1 h) and lay less (5. 4 min of 1 h) than milked cows of the same batch (respectively 7. 0 min and 16. 3 min for standing and lying in cubicles) (P < 0. 01). After omitted milking, cows urinated earlier and more frequently (64. 5 %) than milked cows (36. 3 %) (P < 0. 002) (both batches). There were no statistically significant differences in eating time and feed intake after milking and omitted milking. Milk yield per cow averaged 24. 9 kg during days with omitted (delayed by 1 h) milking and 25. 3 kg during the days without omitted milking (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that cows show some signs of discomfort after omitted milking (urination); this discomfort seemed to be greater in cows coming earlier to the milking parlour (afterwards they preferred to stand rather than to lie). The 60 % of cases of milk leakage found after omitted milking indicates that failed cluster attachment can be accompanied by an extra risk factor for the occurrence of mastitis. However, omitted milking as a treatment did not influence feeding and aggressive behaviour or milking order when unmilked cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time together with the milked cows. Our methods and results can be useful for estimating the effects of robot milking failures on a cow. Future studies should pay particular attention to high-yielding cows and to longer periods of delayed milking. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

40|$|Many {{different}} {{management measures}} {{are available to}} control mastitis, a very costly disease in the dairy sector. The objective {{of this paper was}} to evaluate the costs and efficacies of 18 of these management measures, for contagious and environmental pathogens, and their effect on bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC) and incidence of clinical mastitis (CM). To determine the efficacies for these management measures, literature data and expertise were combined using Monte Carlo expert evaluation analysis. The effect of management measures varied with the incidence of CM and BTSCC, as well as for environmental and contagious problems. On average, postmilking teat disinfection was found to be the most effective measure in all situations. All management measures had large uncertainty around the most likely value. Results of a data envelopment analysis showed that 4 of the management measures included formed the best-practice frontier (the most cost-efficient measures) : keeping cows standing after <b>milking,</b> rinsing <b>clusters</b> after <b>milking</b> a clinical case, using a separate cloth for all cows, and wearing milkers’ gloves. Of the top 25 management measures (the 18 base management measures including levels of compliance), 8 were measures with 100 % compliance; the others were sublevels of these measures with compliance varying between 25 and 100 %. A lower hourly rate of the farmer did not influence management measures from the best-practice frontier, but had some effect on the efficiency scores of the other management measure...|$|R
40|$|To gain an {{understanding}} of the gelation mechanism of mixtures of milk proteins and gelatin, rheological and microstructural properties of the mixtures were characterized following four stages. During the acidification stage (at 45  °C), the presence of gelatin at sufficient concentration (higher than 1 %) led to a lower storage modulus (G′) than that of the pure milk protein gels and a more heterogenous microstructure with larger <b>milk</b> protein <b>clusters</b> was formed. During the cooling (from 45 to 10  °C) and annealing stage s (at 10  °C), the G′ of the gels increased because of both milk gel enhancement and gelatin gelation. Higher concentrations of gelatin led to earlier formation of strand-like structures, seen in the micrographs. The gelation of gelatin changed the microstructure of whey protein isolate (WPI) gel dramatically, while gels of milk protein concentrate (MPC) and skim milk powder (SMP) maintained the typical milk gel network and gelatin formed strands and films without destroying the existing gels. During the heating stage (from 10 to 45  °C), gelatin strands were melted and the G′ of the mixed gels tended to revert to the value {{at the end of the}} acidification stage, indicating that the changes caused by gelatin in the microstructure of milk protein gels after acidification are reversible. Additionally, gelatin enhanced the water holding capacity (WHC) of the gels (no serum expulsion was observed for gels containing ≥ 1 % gelatin), without increasing gel firmness significantly...|$|R
