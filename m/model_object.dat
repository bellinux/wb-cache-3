It uses the same sophisticated techniques used worldwide in motion picture technology for precise bluescreen compositing. CineMorph it is a program to automatically create morphing effects between two given original images, and create a compound third image, or even all the animation movie associated with the morphing effect. Morph Plus performed same effects as Cinemorph. Impact! created physics simulation in 3D scenes.

40|$|For coding {{of moving}} images at low bit rates, an object–based analysis–synthesis coder (OB-ASC) has been introduced[1]. In an OBASC, real objects are {{described}} by model objects.

By the source model of moving 3 D objects[2], {{the shape of a}} <b>model</b> <b>object</b> is represented by a 3 D wireframe. The motion parameters describe translation and rotation of the <b>model</b> <b>object</b> in 3 D space.

In typical videophone sequences, head and shoulders of human persons appear in the scene. This knowledge can be exploited in order to improve the modelling accuracy for this kind of scenes. Therefore, OBASC is extended in [3] to a knowledge–based analysis–synthesis coder (KBASC) by adaptation of the 3 D face model Candide [4] to a person in the scene. In order to adapt Candide, the positions of eyes and mouth have to be estimated. First, assuming that only one person appears in the scene, the head area is extracted by evaluating the silhouette of the person and assuming a wide upper part of the body and a narrower head. Then, the eyes and mouth positions ar...|$|E
