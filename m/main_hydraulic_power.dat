40|$|Pigs {{have been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0 -Hz impedance (Z 0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40 - 55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z 0 and Z 1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z 1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> The energy transmission ratio, defined as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the measured waves divided by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.
