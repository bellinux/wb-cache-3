5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's {{child in}} the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch {{to come and see}} her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable. Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the cameras were off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of al-Qaeda. Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but that the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Arms and the <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{immediately}} replicated. Candida, which presented {{a young woman}} making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when Richard Mansfield's production of the historical melodrama The Devil's Disciple earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.|$|E
5|$|The young <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> certain if {{he should}} accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

As when a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in health of body, his pulse beats so as to declare that he is sick; so when a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well within, his inward pulse, which are his desires--for I count the desires for {{the pulse of the}} inward man--they also declare that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well within.

However, the auctions only sold weapons to people aged over 18 years. Attorney Wolfgang Schweer confirmed to the WDR that no investigation was launched against the auctions.

25|$|Along {{with general}} {{information}} on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of {{looking out for}} oneself. He argues that {{the institution of marriage}} is flawed and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud, and because courts have forced men to pay child support even after DNA testing has established that a <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating single mothers or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|Discovering {{the age of}} {{the first}} human is one facet of anthropogeny, the study of human origins, and a term dated by the Oxford English Dictionary to 1839 and the Medical Dictionary of Robert Hooper. Given the history of {{evolutionary}} thought, and the history of paleontology, the question of the antiquity of man became quite natural to ask at around this period. It was by no means a new question, but it was being asked in a new context of knowledge, particularly in comparative anatomy and palaeontology. The development of relative dating as a principled method allowed deductions of chronology relative to events tied to fossils and strata. This meant, though, that the issue of the antiquity of <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> separable from other debates of the period, on geology and foundations of scientific archaeology.|$|E

25|$|Life for Carson as a {{mountain}} <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> easy. After collecting beavers from traps, {{he had to}} hold onto them {{for months at a}} time until the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in Wyoming. With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including fish hooks, flour and tobacco were procured. As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself. Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred. Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian Islamic jurist and {{religious}} scholar Muhammad Abduh, {{regarded as one}} of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism or sometimes called Neo-Mu’tazilism, broke the rigidity of the Muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties. Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics, they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination {{and religious}} compulsion.|$|E
25|$|At the Belgian Grand Prix, a {{qualifying}} session held {{in mixed}} weather conditions and grid penalties for three drivers allowed {{the team to}} claim its best grid positions of the season, as Senna took 18th, one position ahead of Yamamoto. In the race, however, Senna retired early after suffering a suspension failure which caused him to spin, whilst Yamamoto finished, albeit a place lower than he had started. The Italian Grand Prix that followed {{was held at the}} high-speed Monza circuit, where the F110 was particularly disadvantaged by the team's lack of a low-downforce aerodynamic package. The drivers qualified slowest, with Senna again ahead, and were then elevated a position each when Glock received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. In the race, Senna was another early retirement with a failure in his car's hydraulic system, whilst Yamamoto extended his run of finishes with a 19thplace, ahead of Di Grassi, who retired with three laps to go but was classified as a finisher. Yamamoto struck one of his mechanics as he pulled away from his mid-race pit stop, but the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> seriously injured. During preparation for the Singapore Grand Prix, the team announced that Yamamoto was to be replaced by Klien for the weekend because he was suffering from food poisoning, although several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock, indicating that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead. In his first competitive outing since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, Klien outqualified Senna by more than a second; both Hispania cars lined up ahead of Felipe Massa's Ferrari on the grid, as he had failed to set a time during the session. In the race, Klien ran ahead of Senna until Senna collected the crashed Sauber of Kobayashi, who lost control in front of him, on his 30thlap. Klien retired two laps later when his F110's hydraulics failed. Yamamoto returned to the driving seat for his home race in Japan; he qualified a tenth of a second behind Senna on the back row of the grid. In the race, Senna made a pit stop on the first lap, along with several other drivers, in response to a safety-car period caused by two first-lap accidents. Yamamoto, meanwhile, remained on track, keeping Trulli and Glock behind him for until lap15 and his own stop on lap31 respectively, whereupon he dropped behind Senna. The two drivers achieved a double finish, with Senna in 15thposition and Yamamoto in 16th, despite the latter suffering from fuel pressure problems.|$|E

However, Marquis developed a particularly strong relationship with Wooden Leg, whose lengthy narrative eventually became a separate book, A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Also covered separately was Kate Big Head's narrative, published as She Watched Custer's Last Battle. Another narrative included in The Cheyennes is, [...] "A Cheyenne Old Man".

500|$|According to series {{artist and}} {{producer}} Keiji Inafune, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge {{was the first}} Mega Man game to be outsourced by Capcom for its development.

Because he thought much of his artwork from the original Mega <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> aging well, Inafune redrew many of his old illustrations {{to be used for}} the game's enemy character sprites. Beginning with Mega Man 2 for the NES, Capcom began accepting boss ideas from fans. It was not until Dr. Wily's Revenge that Inafune was able to design a boss character from scratch. To keep with the musical motif of naming characters, the new character Enker was named after the Japanese genre enka.|$|E
