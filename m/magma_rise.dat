We develop a model of the degree of coalescence between gas bubbles in the magma which allows us to simulate the transition between the two extreme styles of activity. We find that <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> speed is the most important factor causing the transition, with gas content and viscosity also influencing the rise speed at which the transition occurs. Counter to intuitive expectations, a decrease in gas content does not cause a transition from Hawaiian to Strombolian activity, but instead causes a transition to passive effusion of vesicular lava.

The style of {{volcanic eruptions}} of silicic magmas ranging from slow effusive outpourings of lava to violent explosive Plinian eruptions is explored in this thesis. During <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> to the Earth's surface bubble networks can form inducing gas escape from the magma. When this process of magma outgassing is efficient, eruptions lose their energy and may effuse as lava flows or as domes. When exsolved gas cannot escape easily, the magma foam may fragment and the flow style abruptly shifts to a turbulent gas flow carrying magma fragments. Magma outgassing and fragmentation govern the effusive-explosive transition and are investigated by means of studying the pumices formed by the Kos Plateau Tuff eruption in combination with computational fluid dynamics of conduit flow...|$|E
40|$|We {{show the}} results of {{simulations}} of basaltic strato-volcano activity by using a cellular automaton model where magma is allowed to rise through self-organized crack networks.

40|$|The 151 ka Sutri Formation, {{erupted from}} the Vico Volcano, Central Italy, {{represents}} a caldera forming eruptive sequence consisting of associated pyroclastic fall and ignimbrite deposits and voluminous coarse, proximal lithic, spatter and pumice-rich breccia facies. After an initial limited Plinian fallout phase (Sutri A) and a partial eruption column collapse event that generated a small volume pyroclastic flow (Sutri B), the later {{stages of the}} Sutri eruption produced a southerly-dispersed lithic clast-rich breccia (Sutri C) that grades vertically into a fines poor ignimbrite (Sutri D). Sutri C is interpreted to be a co-ignimbrite lag breccia involving an element of lateral flow produced during vent widening. Vent widening in the south presumably occurred in response to vent wall rock instabilities and increased magma discharge rate during the early Plinian phase that destroyed {{a large portion of}} the southern side of the pre-existing Vico stratovolcano/shield edifice. The vertical gradation into an overlying fines poor ignimbrite (Sutri D) reflects changing source conditions at the vent, a progressive increase in magma discharge rate and cessation of vent-widening activity. A succeeding, more extensive and complex association of contemporaneous proximal lithic-rich and spatter-rich breccias that are distributed radially around the present day caldera (Sutri E 4) are also considered. No stratigraphic relationship exists between the Sutri E 4 breccia facies and the lower breccia facies (Sutri C) due to limited outcrop. Three subdivisions of Sutri E 4 are recognised based on field analysis, grainsize studies and petrographic characteristics. All occur at the same stratigraphic level radially around the caldera and are distinguished as separate facies from Sutri C and D based on componentry: Sutri E 4 (sbx) — spatter-rich breccia (north–east); Sutri E 4 (lsbx) — boulder size lithic clast-rich breccia with associated spatter component (southeast–south) and Sutri E 4 (flsbx) — spatter-rich breccia with associated lithic clast component (southwest–west). Mixtures of dense, boulder size lithic clasts, spatter and pumice clasts were most likely ejected up along a widening conduit in the north as well as through newly created, radially distributed fissures formed by steadily increasing magma discharge rate in response to progressive collapse of the magma chamber roof into the chamber. Eruption column collapse occurred and lithic, spatter and pumice rich co-ignimbrite breccias were emplaced radially around the vent (Sutri E 4 (sbx, lsbx) signalling the onset of caldera collapse, shortly followed after by emplacement of the Tufo rosso a scorie nere (Sutri E 4 (flsbx) and E 5) and final caldera collapse. This study is concerned with the mechanism responsible for mixing of large variably vesiculated spatter, highly vesiculated pumice and abundant lithic clasts preserved in both these proximal breccias (i. e. in the conduit and/or eruption column or during transport and emplacement) and considers the implications for the eruption styles produced. The juvenile clast types are mixed in each breccia facies together with voluminous quantities of conduit wall rock lithic clasts. We concluded that they were generated contemporaneously within a single volcanic conduit that likely widened over time into concentrically distributed fissures. The degree of vesiculation and resulting morphology of the juvenile clasts likely reflect variations in <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> rate whereby fast <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> rate or faster than bubble nucleation and coalescence produced spatter and slower <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> rates promoted bubble growth and coalescence producing pumice...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePost-collapse {{resurgence}} is {{a phenomenon}} affecting many calderas. Attributed to a renewed <b>magma</b> <b>rise,</b> the process is still poorly understood and the associated source parameters remain poorly constrained. A set of experiments has been conducted to gain insight into the structural evolution of caldera resurgent domes. A sand–plaster mixture was chosen as an analogue for the brittle pile of volcanic rocks, and silicone putty simulates the ductile behavior of the intruding magma. Resurgence {{is driven by the}} vertical uplift of the silicone, with variable shape and depth. Similarity conditions are achieved through eight dimensionless numbers, which are of the same order of magnitude in both nature and experiments. Results show that extension due to doming is, in many cases, accommodated by one axial graben. Opposite master faults of this graben intersect at depth at the junction with the rising viscous silicone. The simplicity of the geometry of the whole analogue system provides equations which allow the estimation of the silicone depth from surface parameters. These equations are then used in some field examples to assess the magma depth beneath natural resurgent domes...|$|E

Supported by seismic tomography and magnetotelluric investigations, which identified a large low-velocity and conductive zone extending from the upper mantle to the middle crust, Umeda et al. (2012) interpreted the high 3 He/ 4 He ratios in southwest Japan close to the volcanic front with upward migration of mantle fluids from an upwelling astenospheric body.

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} eruptions are shortly preceded by injection of new magma into a pre-existing, shallow (< 10 km) magma chamber, causing convection and mixing between the incoming and resident magmas.

Although new magma injection into shallow magma chambers can lead to hazardous event, such injection is still not systematically detected and recognized. Here, we present the results of numerical simulations of magma convection and mixing in geometrically complex magmatic systems, and describe the multiparametric dynamics associated with buoyant magma injection. Our results reveal unexpected pressure trends and pressure oscillations in the Ultra-Long-Period (ULP) range of minutes, related to the generation of discrete plumes of rising magma. Very long pressure oscillation wavelengths translate into comparably ULP ground displacements with amplitudes of order 10 − 4 – 10 − 2 m.

40|$|The Tyrrhenian {{margin of}} central Italy has {{undergone}} Plio-Quaternary extension, developing NW-SE normal faults and NE-SW faults. The NE-SW faults decrease in frequency towards NE with the stretching factor , becoming negligible for  0. 21. These {{data suggest that}} the NE-SW transtensive structures are transfer faults of the NW-SE normal faults, due to relevant differential extension (> 0. 21) within a stretched crust (> 1. 3). The minor dip-slip and strike-slip components of the NE-SW and NW-SE faults respectively, possibly result from the NW-SE extension due to the SE-ward slab retreat beneath the Calabrian arc. The NE-SW and NW-SE extensions in the central-southern Tyrrhenian Sea account for the composite kinematics of the NE-SW structures, which, in turn, exert a two-fold role in controlling volcanism. Where their dip-slip component forms basins, the associated decompression induces magma accumulation (developing central volcanoes) at the intersection among NW-SE and NE-SW systems. Where transfer faults are mainly strike-slip, their inferred subvertical attitude enhances their permeability to magma, accounting for the observed NE-SW fissure eruptions. Regional extension, forming NW-SE faults, enhances the overall generation and rise of magma along the margin, but NE-SW structures focus <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> and emplacement at shallower levels...|$|E

40|$|In Patagonia, Argentina, at the {{northern}} border of the Patagonian Cenozoic mafic plateau lava fields, newly discovered diatremes stand about 100 m above the surrounding plain. These diatremes document phreato-magmatic episodes associated {{with the formation of}} the volcanic fields. The identified pyroclastic and intrusive rocks are exposed lower diatremes of former phreato-magmatic volcanoes and their feeding dyke systems. These remotely located erosional remnants cut through Paleozoic granitoids and Jurassic/Cretaceous alternating siliciclastic continental successions that are relatively easily eroded. Plateau lava fields are generally located a few hundreds of metres above the highest level of the present tops of the preserved diatremes suggesting a complex erosional history and potential interrelationships between the newly identified diatremes and the surrounding lava fields. Uprising magma from the underlying feeder dyke into the diatreme root zone intruded the clastic debris in the diatremes, inflated them and mingled with the debris to form subterranean peperite. The significance of identifying diatremes in Patagonia are twofold: 1) in the syn-eruptive paleo-environment, water was available in various "soft-sediments", commonly porous, media aquifer sources, and 2) the identified abundant diatremes that form diatreme fields are good source candidates for the extensive lava fields with phreatomagmatism facilitating <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> with effective opening of fissures before major lava effusions...|$|E
40|$|Volcanic {{activity}} focuses along plate boundaries. However, large volcanoes {{are also}} found in intraplate settings. For these volcanoes, geodynamic processes responsible for magma generation and structural controls on <b>magma</b> <b>rise</b> and extrusion need to be evaluated. We merge original (field and remote sensing) and available (geodetic, geophysical, and petrological) data to consider the tectono-magmatic relationships of three large intraplate volcanoes in the E-Anatolian-Iranian plateau; Sar’akhor (NE Iran), Damavand (Central Alborz) and Ararat (E Anatolia). In NE Iran, a Miocene-Pliocene NW-trending compression activated E-W dextral faults to the NW of Sar’akhor and N-S sinistral faults to the SE, creating an extruding wedge {{to the west of}} this volcano. Since Quaternary, NE-trending compression inverted fault movement, hindering further block extrusion and volcanism terminated. The adakitic composition of the Sar’akhor rocks suggests post-collisional melting of oceanic slab and/or mafic lower crust, possibly triggered by an asthenospheric rise after slab break-off or intramantle delamination. For the active Damavand and Ararat volcanoes, available data suggest magma generation due to rising hot asthenosphere, following lithospheric delamination or slab break-off in a transtensional environment. The features common to Sar’akhor, Damavand and Ararat allow proposing a model, where transtension focuses the rise of magma in intraplate settings overlying hot asthenosphere produced by delamination or slab break-off...|$|E

We compiled an eruption-event record for the last c. 9, 500 years at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand through detailed radiocarbon dating of recent deposits and a sediment core from a nearby lake. This is the highest-precision record ever collected from the volcano, but it still probably underestimates the frequency of eruptions, which will only be better approximated by adding data from more sediment core sites in different tephra-dispersal directions. A mixture of Weibull distributions provided the best fit to the inter-event period data for the 123 events. Depending on which date is accepted for the last event, the mixture-of-Weibulls model probability is at least 0. 37 - 0. 48 for a new eruption from Mt Taranaki in the next 50 years.
