As such, the term technological iatrogenesis describes this new category of adverse events that are an emergent property resulting from technological innovation creating system and <b>microsystem</b> disturbances. Healthcare systems are complex and adaptive, meaning there are many networks and connections working simultaneously to produce certain outcomes. When these systems are under the increased stresses caused by the diffusion of new technology, unfamiliar and new process errors often result. If not recognized, over time these new errors can collectively lead to catastrophic system failures.

50|$|Ecological systems theory, {{originally}} {{formulated by}} Urie Bronfenbrenner, specifies {{four types of}} nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are <b>microsystem,</b> mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. <b>Microsystem</b> is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the <b>microsystem.</b> Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.|$|E
50|$|The <b>microsystem</b> is {{the layer}} {{closest to the}} child and {{contains}} the structures with which the child has direct contact. The <b>microsystem</b> encompasses the relationships and interactions a child has {{with his or her}} immediate surroundings such as family, school, neighborhood, or childcare environments. At the <b>microsystem</b> level, bi-directional influences are strongest and have the greatest impact on the child. However, interactions at outer levels can still impact the inner structures. This core environment stands as the child's venue for initially learning about the world. As the child's most intimate learning setting, it offers him or her a reference point for the world. The <b>microsystem</b> may provide the nurturing centerpiece for the child or become a haunting set of memories. The real power in this initial set of interrelations with family for the child is what they experience in terms of developing trust and mutuality with their significant people. The family is the child's early <b>microsystem</b> for learning how to live. The caring relations between child and parents (or other caregivers) can help to influence a healthy personality. For example, the attachment behaviors of parents offer children their first trust-building experience.|$|E
