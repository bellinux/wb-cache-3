He pointed to new job opportunities and self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, to the coming of partial woman suffrage, and to an acceleration of social reform and state control of the British economy. He found a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and a weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual <b>moral</b> <b>behavior.</b> Marwick concluded that class differentials softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.|$|E

As author Patrick Dooley points out, [...] "What is at stake in The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality.

40|$|To obtain higher yields, farmers may {{excessively}} use pesticides {{when they}} grow crops (like rice, vegetables, or fruit), causing <b>moral</b> hazard <b>behavior.</b> This paper examines how Chinese farmers’ <b>moral</b> hazard <b>behavior</b> in crop production is influenced by their traditional culture. A semi-parametric logistic model is used to investigate the impact of Chinese traditional culture on farmers’ <b>moral</b> hazard <b>behavior.</b> The results reveal that Chinese traditional culture has {{a positive effect on}} ameliorating the farmers’ excessive use of pesticides in crop production, which leads to a moral hazard in agro-product safety. Specifically, when we control for extraneous variables, the probability of moral hazard decreases by 15 % if farmers consider their traditional culture in their production decisions. Moreover, the probability of moral hazard decreases by 17 % if farmers consider the traditional culture as a powerful restraint regarding the use of pesticides. Our analysis provides some supportive evidence on the effect of Chinese traditional culture on mitigating farmers’ excessive use of pesticides...|$|R

We clarify the condition under which a reduction in the recipient’s <b>moral</b> hazard <b>behavior</b> (i. e., improvement in the level of governance) leads to a fall in the proportion of tied aid. We test the predictions of our theoretical analysis using data on the composition of foreign aid by multilateral and bilateral donors. ...|$|R

Confucian dogma dictated what was proper <b>moral</b> <b>behavior,</b> and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one's family. This is exemplified in the Tang law code, which was largely retained in the Song period.

500|$|In Buddhist {{texts and}} practice, giving is {{considered}} the easiest of the three bases of merit. It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind {{for the practice of}} virtue. It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive back what they have given. As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the eight-fold path, the path central in the Buddhist teaching: right speech, right action and right livelihood. Being the main criterion for <b>moral</b> <b>behavior</b> in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of five precepts, although the eight precepts may be kept now and then. The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy. The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (...) —happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana. When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can take someone to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.|$|E

The series gave clues, such as depicting the Creatures of Darkness with coal-black eyes (according to Daniel Knauf, Creatures of Light have an invisible aura). An Avatar's nature {{is determined by the}} type and application of his powers. As the Pitch Document states, Avatars draw their talents and powers from the same pool.

Although the series showed the powers of Ben and Brother Justin, reviewers were still unsure about the main characters' Avataric nature by the end of the first season. When Ben's good nature and Justin's dark heritage became clearer in Season 2, reviewers began to describe Carnivàles underlying message as [...] "essentially the opposite of spiritual belief: fatalism". Daniel Knauf disputed any theory of determinism, and repeatedly pointed to the characters' free will to overcome their destiny. Free choice allows the story to portray Avatars as deliberately not making use of their powers or as acting contrary to their nature; an Avatar would however still have to put consistent effort into not lapsing back into his defined <b>moral</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

40|$|Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Gustavo Carlo. Includes vita. The goal of {{the current}} studies {{was to examine the}} {{associations}} between family-level stressors and low income adolescents' social behaviors. Previous theory and research has suggested that stress can be emotionally and cognitively debilitating and lead to lower levels of positive social behaviors, such as helping behaviors (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). Alternatively, theorists have suggested that traumatic stressors may foster emotional sensitivity and ultimately contribute to higher levels of <b>moral</b> <b>behaviors</b> (Staub, 2007). In order to better understand the associations between stressors and adolescents' <b>moral</b> <b>behaviors,</b> two studies were conducted. Study 1 consisted of adolescents from Camden, NJ and St. Joseph, MO (Camden: n = 19, M age = 15. 38, 72. 2 % girls; St. Joseph: n = 15, M age = 16. 27, 65. 5 % girls). Adolescents completed self-reports of their economic stress and major life events as well as a moral identity structured interview. The results demonstrated that moral identity was marginally, positively associated with economic stressors for the St. Joseph sample such that adolescents with higher moral identity reported higher economic stressors. Moral identity was negatively associated with life events for the Camden sample such that adolescents with higher moral identity reported lower levels of life events. There was no association between moral identity and stressors for the St. Joseph sample, however. Study 2 extended study 1 by examining the associations between economic stressors and life events and adolescents' prosocial and aggressive behaviors via parenting practices (use of social and material rewards) and adolescents' moral identity. The sample consisted of 198 adolescents from St. Joseph, MO (M age = 16. 22, 34. 8 % girls, 84. 1 % White). The results demonstrated that economic stress was negatively associated with parents' use of social rewards, whereas life events were marginally, positively associated with material rewards. Social rewards were positively associated with moral identity. Moral identity, in turn, was associated with <b>moral</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Discussion focuses on the importance of understanding how stressors are associated with parenting <b>behaviors</b> and adolescents' <b>moral</b> outcomes.

Aim: The aim of the present study was to review the literature about the discipline methods.

Results: In the literature it is cited that discipline is not the same as punishment because is more related to teaching. The ultimate goal of effective punishment is to help the child in exercising self-control, accountability and respect. Children raised without proper discipline, are at risk for a variety of behavioral and emotional problems. Over the last decades, many child discipline techniques have been suggested that vary according to the age of the child, the parenting style and the severity of the behavior. The most effective methods are giving rewards and guidance to make good choices, explaining negative consequences for disobedience without issuing threats, teaching of <b>moral</b> <b>behaviors</b> by displaying parents' good and <b>moral</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Another commonly accepted discipline method is "the consequences' which permits children to have the dignity of dealing with results of their behavior.
