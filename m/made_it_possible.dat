5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
