40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new design {{procedure}} for a bidirectional LCL converter {{which has a}} potential to be applied in <b>mobile</b> <b>mine</b> equipment. This type of a converter employs two DC/AC insulated-gate bipolar transistor-based (IGBT) converters and a passive LCL filter instead of a traditional high frequency transformer. LCL filter design is based on both zero reactive power circulation and minimization of voltage across the capacitor. Switching losses are minimized by using soft switching operation. Lower capacitor voltage and related lower stepping ratio can be mitigated by choosing an appropriate switching frequency. The designed converter has attractive performance characteristics under DC faults. The design process and converter performance evaluation are carried out using EMTP-RV digital simulation for a 20 -MW 24 kV/ 1. 2 kV converter.

40|$|Abstract. Mining user {{behavior}} patterns in mobile environments is an emerging topic in data mining fields with wide applications. By integrating moving paths with purchasing transactions, {{one can find}} the sequential purchasing patterns with the moving paths, which are called mobile sequential patterns of the mobile users. Mobile sequential patterns can be applied not only for planning mobile commerce environments but also analyzing and managing online shopping websites. However, unit profits and purchased numbers of the items are not considered in traditional framework of <b>mobile</b> sequential pattern <b>mining.</b> Thus, the patterns with high utility (i. e., profit here) cannot be found. In view of this, we aim at integrating <b>mobile</b> data <b>mining</b> with utility mining for finding high utility mobile sequential patterns in this study.
