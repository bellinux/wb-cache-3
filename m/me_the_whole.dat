But you have fun with the imagery, and for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> concept that everything has to be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has {{to be like a}} fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire." [...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E

Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule. I think for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> space theme {{has a lot to do}} with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E

The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song {{it was noted that}} Ocean [...] "politely withdrew, saying he'd enjoy that discussion but he doesn't want to spoil his audience's experience of his songs". He further commented [...] "but you have fun with the imagery, and for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> concept that everything has to be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire."

The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus if the song drew from his personal experiences, Ocean commented that [...] "I don't do cocaine for breakfast!", {{a reference to the}} lyrics from the song. He continued, [...] "My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know.

500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E

500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E
500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> way. If I don't go down, I'm not going to get a call because they are not going to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E

Two weeks after the 31 January 1988 interview was published she attended an AWB rally. The rally was also frequented by the world press. She was followed by television crews. Allan later relayed the significance of the episode: [...] "I was an ordinary journalist attending an event with the world press; how come they had footage of me if I hadn't been set up?

2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force.

[...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters.

2500|$|Bolland's first cover saw Diana {{next to the}} headline: [...] "The Stunning {{return of}} comics' {{greatest}} heroine!" [...] speaking directly to the reader the words [...] "...Miss me?" [...] Bolland's covers over the next 30-plus issues laid the visual groundwork for the character, and saw Bolland illustrate {{up to and including}} the centennial issue No. 100. To prepare for his work, Bolland [...] "clipped pictures of the most beautiful women of the time – Christy Turlington, Stephanie Seymour, etc." [...] saying that he was predominantly interested in their faces ("The body I generally made up"). Interested particularly in drawing the costume, which he feels [...] "has {{to be one of the}} sexiest in comics," [...] he soon found the character removed from her normal costume in the storyline, [...] "defeating, for <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> point." [...] For her return to her famous costume, Bolland produced the Britannia-esque pose from Wonder Woman #72 (Mar 1993). He says that [...] "mages like that... usually arise when you're completely stuck for an idea." [...] The image was so iconic that it was released as a poster and later turned into a statue. Shortly thereafter, Diana underwent another costume change – this time designed by Bolland, and mostly drawn on the interior pages by Mike Deodato. The black costume was roundly disliked, even by its designer, Bolland, who philosophically says only that [...] "it was what was asked for at the time," [...] and – aside from Camelot 3000 – is [...] "the only occasion" [...] he was asked to design a costume. The new costume – black hotpants, halter top, straight hair (which Bolland did like) and [...] "WW"-emblazoned jacket – was based, Bolland thinks, [...] "on a Versace outfit I saw Cindy Crawford wearing in an issue of Vogue." ...|$|E
