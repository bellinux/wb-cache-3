A general approach to <b>mixed</b> <b>pixel</b> classification is linear spectral unmixing, {{which uses a}} linear mixture model to estimate the abun-dance fractions of signatures within a <b>mixed</b> <b>pixel.</b> As a result, the images generated for classification are usually gray scale images, where the gray level value of a pixel represents a combined amount of the abundance of spectral signatures residing in this pixel. Due {{to a lack of}} standardized data, these <b>mixed</b> <b>pixel</b> algorithms have not been rigorously compared using a unified framework. In this paper, we present a comparative study of some popular classifica-tion algorithms through a standardized HYDICE data set with a custom-designed detection and classification criterion. The algo-rithms to be considered for this study are those developed for spec-tral unmixing, the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP), max-imum likelihood, minimum distance, and Fisher's linear discrimi-nant analysis (LDA). In order to compare <b>mixed</b> <b>pixel</b> classification algorithms against pure pixel classification algorithms, the mixed pixels are converted to pure ones by a designed mixed-to-pure pixel converter.

40|$|Multitemporal, {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS) landsat data {{have been used}} to monitor erosion and sedimentation along the Rosetta Promontory of the Nile Delta. These processes have accelerated significantly since the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1964. Digital differencing of four MSS data sets, using standard algorithms, show that changes observed over a single year period generally occur as strings of single <b>mixed</b> <b>pixels</b> along the coast. Therefore, these can only be used qualitatively to indicate areas where changes occur. Areas of change recorded over a multi-year period are generally larger and thus identified by clusters of pixels; this reduces errors introduced by <b>mixed</b> <b>pixels.</b> Satellites provide a synoptic perspective utilizing data acquired at frequent time intervals. This permits multiple year monitoring of delta evolution on a regional scale...|$|R

Hyperspectral imaging is a continuously growing area of remote sensing applications. The wide spectral range of such imagery, providing a very high spectral resolution, allows to detect and classify surfaces and chemical elements of the observed image. The main problem of hyperspectral data is the (relatively) low spatial resolution, which can vary from a few to tens of meters. Many factors make the spatial resolution {{one of the most}} expensive and hardest to improve in imaging systems. For classification, the major problem caused by low spatial resolution are the <b>mixed</b> <b>pixels,</b> i. e., parts of the image where more than one land cover map lie in the same pixel. In this work we propose a method to address the problem of <b>mixed</b> <b>pixels</b> and to obtain a finer spatial resolution of the land cover classification maps. The method exploits the advantages of both soft classification techniques and spectral unmixing algorithms, in order to determine the fractional abundances of the classes at a sub-pixel scale. Spatial regularization by Simulated Annealing is finally performed to spatially locate the obtained classes.
