25|$|A blender is an upright, {{stationary}} kitchen appliance used to mix {{alcoholic beverages}} and puree food. Blenders {{are also used}} to prepare emulsions, such as mayonnaise, and cream soups. In 1919, Polish-American Stephen J. Poplawski of Racine, Wisconsin invented, designed, and manufactured beverage mixers used in preparation for <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> served at soda fountains. It consisted of a spinning blade on a long rod extending down into a cup. Poplawski patented his invention of the blender in 1922.|$|E
2500|$|Walgreens claims {{credit for}} the popularization of the malted milkshake (or at least its version of the malted milkshake), invented by Ivar [...] "Pop" [...] Coulson in 1922, {{although}} milkshakes and <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> had been around for some time before. This development coincided with {{the invention of the}} electric blender in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "malt" [...] {{refers to}} several {{products}} of the process: the grains to which this process has been applied, for example malted barley; the sugar, heavy in maltose, derived from such grains, such as the baker's malt used in various cereals; or a product based on <b>malted</b> <b>milk,</b> similar to a malted milkshake (i.e., [...] "malts").|$|E

2500|$|Food rations {{obtained}} from the raft supplies for the first 27 days comprised half a biscuit and 12 milk tablets per day per man, plus [...] two squares of chocolate {{for the first six}} days. On 24 April, food rations were reduced to a quarter of a biscuit per day per man, and two days later the last of the rations were consumed, except for a small number of <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> tablets. On 19 May, the two rafts became separated and drifted apart.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the drift, the total rations consisted of 45 biscuits, two tins of chocolate and six tins of <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> tablets per raft. Water was not a problem {{in the early part of}} the voyage due to frequent heavy rain. In May however, it became scarce and was reduced at one stage to 3 oz per man per day. Rations were supplemented by an occasional fish caught by the Malays using an improvised spear made from a pair of scissors lashed to a raft stanchion. Fishing lines in the rafts were useless as the hooks had been stolen. [...] In all 27 fish, along with two birds and one small turtle, were captured in this manner and eaten raw. However, there were long periods with no solid food - up to 10 days at one stage and nine days on another. All three Australian survivors stated that they owed their lives to untiring perseverance and unselfishness of the Malay seamen spearing fish, catching birds and capturing every drop of rain.|$|E
60|$|In fact, it was {{business}} itself {{which had}} compelled Mr. Rasselyer-Brown to drink. It {{is all very}} well for a junior clerk on twenty dollars a week to do his work on sandwiches and <b>malted</b> <b>milk.</b> In big business it is not possible. When a man begins to rise in business, as Mr. Rasselyer-Brown had begun twenty-five years ago, he finds that {{if he wants to}} succeed he must cut <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> clear out. In any position of responsibility a man has got to drink. No really big deal can be put through without it. If two keen men, sharp as flint, get together to make a deal in which each intends to outdo the other, the only way to succeed is for them to adjourn to some such place as the luncheon-room of the Mausoleum Club and both get partially drunk. This is what is called the personal element in business. And, beside it, plodding industry is nowhere.|$|E

5000|$|The use of <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> {{powder in}} milkshakes was popularized in the USA by the Chicago {{drugstore}} chain Walgreens. <b>Malted</b> <b>milk</b> powder — {{a mixture of}} evaporated milk, malted barley, and wheat flour — had been invented by William Horlick in 1897 for use as an easily digested restorative health drink for disabled people and children, and as an infant's food.

In 1922, Walgreens employee Ivar [...] "Pop" [...] Coulson made a milkshake by adding two scoops of vanilla ice cream to the standard <b>malted</b> <b>milk</b> drink recipe. This item, under the name [...] "Horlick's Malted Milk", was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain {{as part of a}} chocolate milk shake, which itself became known as a [...] "malted" [...] or [...] "malt" [...] and {{became one of the most}} popular soda-fountain drinks.|$|E
