5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made.

5|$|Unlike in England, {{where the}} {{nucleated}} village existed relatively early, {{most of the}} early modern population of Scotland, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small clachans or townships and isolated dwellings.

5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this <b>marginal</b> <b>land</b> has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city.

40|$|The use {{of biomass}} as a {{potential}} energy source has both advantages and disadvantages. Biomass is a potential source of fuel energy that provides economic and environmental benefits such as less expensive and less energy intensive production, carbon sequestration and soil preservation. However, the main concern associated with biofuels is that land needed for food {{will be used for}} biofuel crops. One potential solution is the use of <b>marginal</b> <b>lands</b> which are not suited for food production. <b>Marginal</b> <b>lands</b> generally refer to the areas not only with low production, but also with limitations that make them unsuitable for agricultural practices and ecosystem functions. This can be due to various forms of land degradation such as pollution, surface exploitation of mineral resources, erosion, overexploitation and others.

5|$|The {{development}} of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter {{to hold a}} market at his castle, and followed this {{with the creation of}} a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate, around the site that became the Bull Ring. This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau {{at a time when the}} area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously <b>marginal</b> <b>land.</b> Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen.

5|$|As the {{population}} expanded, {{some of these}} settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more <b>marginal</b> <b>land</b> was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements.

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland.

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of <b>marginal</b> <b>land</b> were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} single event to occur during the 19th century, and {{the one with the}} most profound repercussions was the coming of the potato blight, and following famine. Immediately prior to the famine some 425 souls were recorded as inhabiting the townland in the 1841 census. On 6 September 1845 the first occurrence of blight was recorded in the County, and the district as well as surrounding areas were affected soon thereafter. By the 1851 census, the population was recorded as having declined to 346, and this reduced by almost half (on the 1841 figure) to 214 in 1901. The famine hit poor in the area hardest with stories circulating over a century later of the destitute starving with their mouths turned green, having resorted to eating grass. As well as bringing hunger and emigration, the famine brought about longstanding changes in the settlement patterns of the area, with the disappearance of stores and shibeens which had existed prior to the mid-1840s, but disappeared with population decline and the abandonment of <b>marginal</b> <b>land</b> for cultivation.|$|E
25|$|From {{as early}} as 1843 {{shepherding}} had been common around Burra, with pastoral pioneers such as James Stein and William Peter being granted grazing rights for their flocks on unsurveyed land. Over {{the life of the}} Burra Mine, most food was brought in as there was no freehold offered by SAMA on the land and no adjoining hundreds were declared until 1860. Agriculture was delayed by the slow surveying of hundreds, as until these had been done there was no freehold or leasehold land but only grazing rights. As Burra lies almost on Goyder's 1865 line it is rated at the edge of <b>marginal</b> <b>land</b> for farming. After mining the town became a pastoral centre, and South Australia's main sheep trading centre until the mid-20th century. The Baldina Run, a major sheep station of 50 square miles some 10 miles east of Burra, near Kooringa, was established by Henry Ayers in 1851, leased by J and C. B.

25|$|With {{the use of}} non-edible {{vegetable}} oils produced by trees such as Millettia Pinnata (formerly Pongamia Pinnata) or the Moringa oleifera tree, both which grow on borderline or non-arable land, the food versus fuel debate becomes less of an either/or question. Apart from their facility of growing in non-arable and/or <b>marginal</b> <b>land,</b> these trees offer major advantages over peanut, soy-bean, sunflower, etc., in that they have long lives (up to 100 years), very low maintenance (since the intensive husbandry {{is limited to the}} first few years of their producing lives) and can provide cash-crops to rural areas, such as rural India. In the case of Millettia Pinnata and a few others, the fact that they are nitrogen-fixing legumes is another very important factor, in that they do not deplete the soil. Among other benefits of these trees is that they have root-systems that penetrate much deeper and do not compete with shallow-rooted plants, like grass (once the trees have attained a certain maturity). This means that the land can be used for multiple purposes, such as grazing for animals. Yet another benefit of using Millettia Pinnata to produce bio-diesel is that it can tolerate low rainfall (as little as 250 ml per year), far below what most food-crops require, thus reducing yet more their potential to compete.|$|E
